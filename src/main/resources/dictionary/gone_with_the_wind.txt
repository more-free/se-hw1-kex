Gone With The Wind TO JRM Part One CHAPTER I SCARLETT OHARA was not beautiful but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were In her face were too sharply blended the delicate features of her mother a Coast aristocrat of French descent and the heavy ones of her florid Irish father But it was an arresting face pointed of chin square of jaw Her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends Above them her thick black brows slanted upward cutting a startling oblique line in her magnoliawhite skinthat skin so prized by Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns Seated with Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the porch of Tara her fathers plantation that bright April afternoon of  she made a pretty picture Her new green floweredmuslin dress spread its twelve yards of billowing material over her hoops and exactly matched the flatheeled green morocco slippers her father had recently brought her from Atlanta The dress set off to perfection the seventeeninch waist the smallest in three counties and the tightly fitting basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen years But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon and the quietness of small white hands folded in her lap her true self was poorly concealed The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent willful lusty with life distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor Her manners had been imposed upon her by her mothers gentle admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy her eyes were her own On either side of her the twins lounged easily in their chairs squinting at the sunlight through tall mintgarnished glasses as they laughed and talked their long legs booted to the knee and thick with saddle muscles crossed negligently Nineteen years old six feet two inches tall long of bone and hard of muscle with sunburned faces and deep auburn hair their eyes merry and arrogant their bodies clothed in identical blue coats and mustardcolored breeches they were as much alike as two bolls of cotton Outside the late afternoon sun slanted down in the yard throwing into gleaming brightness the dogwood trees that were solid masses of white blossoms against the background of new green The twins horses were hitched in the driveway big animals red as their masters hair and around the horses legs quarreled the pack of lean nervous possum hounds that accompanied Stuart and Brent wherever they went A little aloof as became an aristocrat lay a blackspotted carriage dog muzzle on paws patiently waiting for the boys to go home to supper Between the hounds and the horses and the twins there was a kinship deeper than that of their constant companionship They were all healthy thoughtless young animals sleek graceful highspirited the boys as mettlesome as the horses they rode mettlesome and dangerous but withal sweettempered to those who knew how to handle them Although born to the ease of plantation life waited on hand and foot since infancy the faces of the three on the porch were neither slack nor soft They had the vigor and alertness of country people who have spent all their lives in the open and troubled their heads very little with dull things in books Life in the north Georgia county of Clayton was still new and according to the standards of Augusta Savannah and Charleston a little crude The more sedate and older sections of the South looked down their noses at the upcountry Georgians but here in north Georgia a lack of the niceties of classical education carried no shame provided a man was smart in the things that mattered And raising good cotton riding well shooting straight dancing lightly squiring the ladies with elegance and carrying ones liquor like a gentleman were the things that mattered In these accomplishments the twins excelled and they were equally outstanding in their notorious inability to learn anything contained between the covers of books Their family had more money more horses more slaves than any one else in the County but the boys had less grammar than most of their poor Cracker neighbors It was for this precise reason that Stuart and Brent were idling on the porch of Tara this April afternoon They had just been expelled from the University of Georgia the fourth university that had thrown them out in two years and their older brothers Tom and Boyd had come home with them because they refused to remain at an institution where the twins were not welcome Stuart and Brent considered their latest expulsion a fine joke and Scarlett who had not willingly opened a book since leaving the Fayetteville Female Academy the year before thought it just as amusing as they did I know you two dont care about being expelled or Tom either she said But what about Boyd Hes kind of set on getting an education and you two have pulled him out of the University of Virginia and Alabama and South Carolina and now Georgia Hell never get finished at this rate Oh he can read law in Judge Parmalees office over in Fayetteville answered Brent carelessly Besides it dont matter much Wed have had to come home before the term was out anyway Why The war goose The wars going to start any day and you dont suppose any of us would stay in college with a war going on do you You know there isnt going to be any war said Scarlett bored Its all just talk Why Ashley Wilkes and his father told Pa just last week that our commissioners in Washington would come totoanamicable agreement with Mr Lincoln about the Confederacy And anyway the Yankees are too scared of us to fight There wont be any war and Im tired of hearing about it Not going to be any war cried the twins indignantly as though they had been defrauded Why honey of course theres going to be a war said Stuart The Yankees may be scared of us but after the way General Beauregard shelled them out of Fort Sumter day before yesterday theyll have to fight or stand branded as cowards before the whole world Why the Confederacy Scarlett made a mouth of bored impatience If you say war just once more Ill go in the house and shut the door Ive never gotten so tired of any one word in my life as Gone With The Wind war unless its secession Pa talks war morning noon and night and all the gentlemen who come to see him shout about Fort Sumter and States Rights and Abe Lincoln till I get so bored I could scream And thats all the boys talk about too that and their old Troop There hasnt been any fun at any party this spring because the boys cant talk about anything else Im mighty glad Georgia waited till after Christmas before it seceded or it would have ruined the Christmas parties too If you say war again Ill go in the house She meant what she said for she could never long endure any conversation of which she was not the chief subject But she smiled when she spoke consciously deepening her dimple and fluttering her bristly black lashes as swiftly as butterflies wings The boys were enchanted as she had intended them to be and they hastened to apologize for boring her They thought none the less of her for her lack of interest Indeed they thought more War was mens business not ladies and they took her attitude as evidence of her femininity Having maneuvered them away from the boring subject of war she went back with interest to their immediate situation What did your mother say about you two being expelled again The boys looked uncomfortable recalling their mothers conduct three months ago when they had come home by request from the University of Virginia Well said Stuart she hasnt had a chance to say anything yet Tom and us left home early this morning before she got up and Toms laying out over at the Fontaines while we came over here Didnt she say anything when you got home last night We were in luck last night Just before we got home that new stallion Ma got in Kentucky last month was brought in and the place was in a stew The big brutehes a grand horse Scarlett you must tell your pa to come over and see him right awayhed already bitten a hunk out of his groom on the way down here and hed trampled two of Mas darkies who met the train at Jonesboro And just before we got home hed about kicked the stable down and halfkilled Strawberry Mas old stallion When we got home Ma was out in the stable with a sackful of sugar smoothing him down and doing it mighty well too The darkies were hanging from the rafters popeyed they were so scared but Ma was talking to the horse like he was folks and he was eating out of her hand There aint nobody like Ma with a horse And when she saw us she said In Heavens name what are you four doing home again Youre worse than the plagues of Egypt And then the horse began snorting and rearing and she said Get out of here Cant you see hes nervous the big darling Ill tend to you four in the morning So we went to bed and this morning we got away before she could catch us and left Boyd to handle her Do you suppose shell hit Boyd Scarlett like the rest of the County could never get used to the way small Mrs Tarleton bullied her grown sons and laid her riding crop on their backs if the occasion seemed to warrant it Beatrice Tarleton was a busy woman having on her hands not only a large cotton plantation a hundred negroes and eight children but the largest horsebreeding farm in the state as well She was hottempered and easily plagued by the frequent scrapes of her four sons and while no one was permitted to whip a horse or a slave she felt that a lick now and then didnt do the boys any harm Of course she wont hit Boyd She never did beat Boyd much because hes the oldest and besides hes the runt of the litter said Stuart proud of his six feet two Thats why we left him at home to explain things to her Godlmighty Ma ought to stop licking us Were nineteen and Toms twentyone and she acts like were six years old Will your mother ride the new horse to the Wilkes barbecue tomorrow She wants to but Pa says hes too dangerous And anyway the girls wont let her They said they were going to have her go to one party at least like a lady riding in the carriage I hope it doesnt rain tomorrow said Scarlett Its rained nearly every day for a week Theres nothing worse than a barbecue turned into an indoor picnic Oh itll be clear tomorrow and hot as June said Stuart Look at Oat sunset I never saw one redder You can always tell weather by sunsets They looked out across the endless acres of Gerald OHaras newly plowed cotton fields toward the red horizon Now that the sun was setting in a welter of crimson behind tin lulls across the Flint River the warmth of the April day was ebbing into a faint but balmy chill Spring had come early that year with warm quick rains and sudden frothing of pink peach blossoms and dogwood dappling with white stars the dark river swamp and faroff hills Already the plowing was nearly finished and the bloody glory of the sunset colored the freshcut furrows of red Georgia clay to even redder hues The moist hungry earth waiting upturned for the cotton seeds showed pinkish on the sandy tops of furrows vermilion and scarlet and maroon where shadows lay along the sides of the trenches The whitewashed brick plantation house seemed an island set in a wild red sea a sea of spiraling curving crescent billows petrified suddenly at the moment when the pinktipped waves were breaking into surf For here were no long straight furrows such as could be seen in the yellow clay fields of the flat middle Georgia country or in the lush black earth of the coastal plantations The rolling foothill country of north Georgia was plowed in a million curves to keep the rich earth from washing down into the river bottoms It was a savagely red land bloodcolored after rains brick dust in droughts the best cotton land in the world It was a pleasant land of white houses peaceful plowed fields and sluggish yellow rivers but a land of contrasts of brightest sun glare and densest shade The plantation clearings and miles of cotton fields smiled up to a warm sun placid complacent At their edges rose the virgin forests dark and cool even in the hottest noons mysterious a little sinister the soughing pines seeming to wait with an ageold patience to threaten with soft sighs Be careful Be careful We had you once We can take you back again To the ears of the three on the porch came the sounds of hooves the jingling of harness chains and the shrill careless laughter of negro voices as the field hands and mules came in from the fields From within the house floated the soft voice of Scarletts mother Ellen OHara as she called to the little black girl who carried her basket of keys The highpitched childish voice answered Yasm and there were sounds of footsteps going out the back way toward the smokehouse where Ellen would ration out the food to the homecoming hands There was the click of china and the rattle of silver as Pork the valetbutler of Tara laid Gone With The Wind the table for supper At these last sounds the twins realized it was time they were starting home But they were loath to face their mother and they lingered on the porch of Tara momentarily expecting Scarlett to give them an invitation to supper Look Scarlett About tomorrow said Brent Just because weve been away and didnt know about the barbecue and the ball thats no reason why we shouldnt get plenty of dances tomorrow night You havent promised them all have you Well I have How did I know you all would be home I couldnt risk being a wallflower just waiting on you two You a wallflower The boys laughed uproariously Look honey Youve got to give me the first waltz and Stu the last one and youve got to eat supper with us Well sit on the stair landing like we did at the last ball and get Mammy Jincy to come tell our fortunes again I dont like Mammy Jincys fortunes You know she said I was going to marry a gentleman with jetblack hair and a long black mustache and I dont like blackhaired gentlemen You like em redheaded dont you honey grinned Brent Now come on promise us all the waltzes and the supper If youll promise well tell you a secret said Stuart What cried Scarlett alert as a child at the word Is it what we heard yesterday in Atlanta Stu If it is you know we promised not to tell Well Miss Pitty told us Miss Who You know Ashley Wilkes cousin who lives in Atlanta Miss Pittypat HamiltonCharles and Melanie Hamiltons aunt I do and a sillier old lady I never met in all my life Well when we were in Atlanta yesterday waiting for the home train her carriage went by the depot and she stopped and talked to us and she told us there was going to be an engagement announced tomorrow night at the Wilkes ball Oh I know about that said Scarlett in disappointment That silly nephew of hers Charlie Hamilton and Honey Wilkes Everybodys known for years that theyd get married some time even if he did seem kind of lukewarm about it Do you think hes silly questioned Brent Last Christmas you sure let him buzz round you plenty I couldnt help him buzzing Scarlett shrugged negligently I think hes an awful sissy Besides it isnt his engagement thats going to be announced said Stuart triumphantly Its Ashleys to Charlies sister Miss Melanie Scarletts face did not change but her lips went whitelike a person who has received a stunning blow without warning and who in the first moments of shock does not realize what has happened So still was her face as she stared at Stuart that he never analytic took it for granted that she was merely surprised and very interested Miss Pitty told us they hadnt intended announcing it till next year because Miss Melly hasnt been very well but with all the war talk going around everybody in both families thought it would be better to get married soon So its to be announced tomorrow night at the supper intermission Now Scarlett weve told you the secret so youve got to promise to eat supper with us Of course I will Scarlett said automatically And all the waltzes All Youre sweet Ill bet the other boys will be hopping mad Let em be mad said Brent We two can handle em Look Scarlett Sit with us at the barbecue in the morning What Stuart repeated his request Of course The twins looked at each other jubilantly but with some surprise Although they considered themselves Scarletts favored suitors they had never before gained tokens of this favor so easily Usually she made them beg and plead while she put them off refusing to give a Yes or No answer laughing if they sulked growing cool if they became angry And here she had practically promised them the whole of tomorrowseats by her at the barbecue all the waltzes and theyd see to it that the dances were all waltzes and the supper intermission This was worth getting expelled from the university Filled with new enthusiasm by their success they lingered on talking about the barbecue and the ball and Ashley Wilkes and Melanie Hamilton interrupting each other making jokes and laughing at them hinting broadly for invitations to supper Some time had passed before they realized that Scarlett was having very little to say The atmosphere had somehow changed Just how the twins did not know but the fine glow had gone out of the afternoon Scarlett seemed to be paying little attention to what they said although she made the correct answers Sensing something they could not understand baffled and annoyed by it the twins struggled along for a while and then rose reluctantly looking at their watches The sun was low across the newplowed fields and the tall woods across the river were looming blackly in silhouette Chimney swallows were darting swiftly across the yard and chickens ducks and turkeys were waddling and strutting and straggling in from the fields Stuart bellowed Jeems And after an interval a tall black boy of their own age ran breathlessly around the house and out toward the tethered horses Jeems was their body servant and like the dogs accompanied them everywhere He had been their childhood playmate and had been given to the twins for their own on their tenth birthday At the sight of him the Tarleton hounds rose up out of the red dust and stood waiting expectantly for their masters The boys bowed shook hands and told Scarlett theyd be over at the Wilkeses early in the morning waiting for her Then they were off down the walk at a rush mounted their horses and followed by Jeems went down the avenue of cedars at a gallop waving their hats and yelling back to her When they had rounded the curve of the dusty road that hid them from Tara Brent drew his horse to a stop under a clump of dogwood Stuart halted too and the darky boy pulled up a few paces behind them The horses feeling slack reins stretched down their necks to crop the tender spring grass and the patient hounds lay down again in the soft red dust and looked up  Page    Gone With The Wind longingly at the chimney swallows circling in the gathering dusk Brents wide ingenuous face was puzzled and mildly indignant Look he said Dont it look to you like she would of asked us to stay for supper I thought she would said Stuart I kept waiting for her to do it but she didnt What do you make of it I dont make anything of it But it just looks to me like she might of After all its our first day home and she hasnt seen us in quite a spell And we had lots more things to tell her It looked to me like she was mighty glad to see us when we came I thought so too And then about a halfhour ago she got kind of quiet like she had a headache I noticed that but I didnt pay it any mind then What do you suppose ailed her I dunno Do you suppose we said something that made her mad They both thought for a minute I cant think of anything Besides when Scarlett gets mad everybody knows it She dont hold herself in like some girls do Yes thats what I like about her She dont go around being cold and hateful when shes madshe tells you about it But it was something we did or said that made her shut up talking and look sort of sick I could swear she was glad to see us when we came and was aiming to ask us to supper You dont suppose its because we got expelled Hell no Dont be a fool She laughed like everything when we told her about it And besides Scarlett dont set any more store by book learning than we do Brent turned in the saddle and called to the negro groom Jeems Suh You heard what we were talking to Miss Scarlett about Nawsuh Mist Brent Huccome you think Ah be spyin on wite folks Spying my God You darkies know everything that goes on Why you liar I saw you with my own eyes sidle round the corner of the porch and squat in the cape jessamine bush by the wall Now did you hear us say anything that might have made Miss Scarlett mador hurt her feelings Thus appealed to Teems gave up further pretense of not having overheard the conversation and furrowed his black brow Nawsuh Ah din notice yall say anything ter mek her mad Look ter me lak she sho glad ter see you an sho had missed you an she cheep along happy as a bird tell bout de time yall got ter talkin bout Mist Ashley an Miss Melly Hamilton gittin mahied Den she quiet down lak a bird wen de hawk fly ober The twins looked at each other and nodded but without comprehension Jeems is right But I dont see why said Stuart My Lord Ashley dont mean anything to her cept a friend Shes not crazy about him Its us shes crazy about Brent nodded an agreement But do you suppose he said that maybe Ashley hadnt told her he was going to announce it tomorrow night and she was mad at him for not telling her an old friend before he told everybody else Girls set a big store on knowing such things first Well maybe But what if he hadnt told her it was tomorrow It was supposed to be a secret and a surprise and a mans got a right to keep his own engagement quiet hasnt he We wouldnt have known it if Miss Mellys aunt hadnt let it out But Scarlett must have known he was going to marry Miss Melly sometime Why weve known it for years The Wilkes and Hamiltons always marry their own cousins Everybody knew hed probably marry her some day just like Honey Wilkes is going to marry Miss Mellys brother Charles Well I give it up But Im sorry she didnt ask us to supper I swear I dont want to go home and listen to Ma take on about us being expelled It isnt as if this was the first time Maybe Boyd will have smoothed her down by now You know what a slick talker that little varmint is You know he always can smooth her down Yes he can do it but it takes Boyd time He has to talk around in circles till Ma gets so confused that she gives up and tells him to save his voice for his law practice But he aint had time to get good started yet Why Ill bet you Ma is still so excited about the new horse that shell never even realize were home again till She sits down to supper tonight and sees Boyd And before supper is over shell be going strong and breathing fire And itll be ten oclock before Boyd gets a chance to tell her that it wouldnt have been honorable for any of us to stay in college after the way the Chancellor talked to you and me And itll be midnight before he gets her turned around to where shes so mad at the Chancellor shell be asking Boyd why he didnt shoot him No we cant go home till after midnight The twins looked at each other glumly They were completely fearless of wild horses shooting affrays and the indignation of their neighbors but they had a wholesome fear of their redhaired mothers outspoken remarks and the riding crop that she did not scruple to lay across their breeches Well look said Brent Lets go over to the Wilkes Ashley and the girlsll be glad to have us for supper Stuart looked a little discomforted No dont lets go there Theyll be in a stew getting ready for the barbecue tomorrow and besides Oh I forgot about that said Brent hastily No dont lets go there They clucked to their horses and rode along in silence for a while a flush of embarrassment on Stuarts brown cheeks Until the previous summer Stuart had courted India Wilkes with the approbation of both families and the entire County The County felt that perhaps the cool and contained India Wilkes would have a quieting effect on him They fervently hoped so at any rate And Stuart might have made the match but Brent had not been satisfied Brent liked India but he thought her mighty plain and tame and he simply could not fall in love with her himself to keep Stuart company That was the first time the twins interest had ever  Page    Gone With The Wind diverged and Brent was resentful of his brothers attentions to a girl who seemed to him not at all remarkable Then last summer at a political speaking in a grove of oak trees at Jonesboro they both suddenly became aware of Scarlett OHara They had known her for years and since their childhood she had been a favorite playmate for she could ride horses and climb trees almost as well as they But now to their amazement she had become a grownup young lady and quite the most charming one in all the world They noticed for the first time how her green eyes danced how deep her dimples were when she laughed how tiny her hands and feet and what a small waist she had Their clever remarks sent her into merry peals of laughter and inspired by the thought that she considered them a remarkable pair they fairly outdid themselves It was a memorable day in the life of the twins Thereafter when they talked it over they always wondered just why they had failed to notice Scarletts charms before They never arrived at the correct answer which was that Scarlett on that day had decided to make them notice She was constitutionally unable to endure any man being in love with any woman not herself and the sight of India Wilkes and Stuart at the speaking had been too much for her predatory nature Not content with Stuart alone she had set her cap for Brent as well and with a thoroughness that overwhelmed the two of them Now they were both in love with her and India Wilkes and Letty Munroe from Lovejoy whom Brent had been halfheartedly courting were far in the back of their minds Just what the loser would do should Scarlett accept either one of them the twins did not ask They would cross that bridge when they came to it For the present they were quite satisfied to be in accord again about one girl for they had no jealousies between them It was a situation which interested the neighbors and annoyed their mother who had no liking for Scarlett It will serve you right if that sly piece does accept one of you she said Or maybe shell accept both of you and then youll have to move to Utah if the Mormonsll have youwhich I doubt  All that bothers me is that some one of these days youre both going to get lickered up and jealous of each other about that twofaced little greeneyed baggage and youll shoot each other But that might not be a bad idea either Since the day of the speaking Stuart had been uncomfortable in Indias presence Not that India ever reproached him or even indicated by look or gesture that she was aware of his abruptly changed allegiance She was too much of a lady But Stuart felt guilty and ill at ease with her He knew he had made India love him and he knew that she still loved him and deep in his heart he had the feeling that he had not played the gentleman He still liked her tremendously and respected her for her cool good breeding her book learning and all the sterling qualities she possessed But damn it she was just so pallid and uninteresting and always the same beside Scarletts bright and changeable charm You always knew where you stood with India and you never had the slightest notion with Scarlett That was enough to drive a man to distraction but it had its charm Well lets go over to Cade Calverts and have supper Scarlett said Cathleen was home from Charleston Maybe shell have some news about Fort Sumter that we havent heard Not Cathleen Ill lay you two to one she didnt even know the fort was out there in the harbor much less that it was full of Yankees until we shelled them out All shell know about is the balls she went to and the beaux she collected Well its fun to hear her gabble And itll be somewhere to hide out till Ma has gone to bed Well hell I like Cathleen and she is fun and Id like to hear about Caro Rhett and the rest of the Charleston folks but Im damned if I can stand sitting through another meal with that Yankee stepmother of hers Dont be too hard on her Stuart She means well Im not being hard on her I feel sorry for her but I dont like people Ive got to feel sorry for And she fusses around so much trying to do the right thing and make you feel at home that she always manages to say and do just exactly the wrong thing She gives me the fidgets And she thinks Southerners are wild barbarians She even told Ma so Shes afraid of Southerners Whenever were there she always looks scared to death She reminds me of a skinny hen perched on a chair her eyes kind of bright and blank and scared all ready to flap and squawk at the slightest move anybody makes Well you cant blame her You did shoot Cade in the leg Well I was lickered up or I wouldnt have done it said Stuart And Cade never had any hard feelings Neither did Cathleen or Raiford or Mr Calvert It was just that Yankee stepmother who squalled and said I was a wild barbarian and decent people werent safe around uncivilized Southerners Well you cant blame her Shes a Yankee and aint got very good manners and after all you did shoot him and he is her stepson Well hell Thats no excuse for insulting me You are Mas own blood son but did she take on that time Tony Fontaine shot you in the leg No she just sent for old Doc Fontaine to dress it and asked the doctor what ailed Tonys aim Said she guessed licker was spoiling his marksmanship Remember how mad that made Tony Both boys yelled with laughter Mas a card said Brent with loving approval You can always count on her to do the right thing and not embarrass you in front of folks Yes but shes mighty liable to talk embarrassing in front of Father and the girls when we get home tonight said Stuart gloomily Look Brent I guess this means we dont go to Europe You know Mother said if we got expelled from another college we couldnt have our Grand Tour Well hell We dont care do we What is there to see in Europe Ill bet those foreigners cant show us a thing we havent got right here in Georgia Ill bet their horses arent as fast or their girls as pretty and I know damn well they havent got any rye whisky that can touch Fathers Ashley Wilkes said they had an awful lot of scenery and music Ashley liked Europe Hes always talking about it Wellyou know how the Wilkes are They are kind of queer about music and books and scenery Mother says its because their grandfather came from Virginia She says Virginians set quite a store by such things They can have em Give me a good horse to ride and some good licker to drink and a good girl to court and a bad girl to have fun with and anybody can have their Europe  What do we care about missing the Tour Suppose we were in Europe now with Gone With The Wind the war coming on We couldnt get home soon enough Id heap rather go to a war than go to Europe So would I any day  Look Brent I know where we can go for supper Lets ride across the swamp to Abel Wynders place and tell him were all four home again and ready for drill Thats an idea cried Brent with enthusiasm And we can hear all the news of the Troop and find out what color they finally decided on for the uniforms If its Zouave Im damned if Ill go in the troop Id feel like a sissy in those baggy red pants They look like ladies red flannel drawers to me Is yall aimin ter go ter Mist Wynders Cause ef you is you ain gwine git much supper said Jeems Dey cook done died an dey ain bought a new one Dey got a feel han cookin an de niggers tells me she is de wustest cook in de state Good God Why dont they buy another cook Huccome po wite trash buy any niggers Dey ain never owned mon fo at de mostes There was frank contempt in Jeems voice His own social status was assured because the Tarletons owned a hundred negroes and like all slaves of large planters he looked down on small farmers whose slaves were few Im going to beat your hide off for that cried Stuart fiercely Dont you call Abel Wynder po white Sure hes poor but he aint trash and Im damned if Ill have any man darky or White throwing off on him There aint a better man in this County or why else did the Troop elect him lieutenant Ah ain never figgered dat out mahseff replied Jeems undisturbed by his masters scowl Look ter me lak deyd lect all de awficers frum rich gempmum stead of swamp trash He aint trash Do you mean to compare him with real white trash like the Slatterys Abel just aint rich Hes a small farmer not a big planter and if the boys thought enough of him to elect him lieutenant then its not for any darky to talk impudent about him The Troop knows what its doing The troop of cavalry had been organized three months before the very day that Georgia seceded from the Union and since then the recruits had been whistling for war The outfit was as yet unnamed though not for want of suggestions Everyone had his own idea on that subject and was loath to relinquish it just as everyone had ideas about the color and cut of the uniforms Clayton Wild Cats Fire Eaters North Georgia Hussars Zouaves The Inland Rifles although the Troop was to be armed with pistols sabers and bowie knives and not with rifles The Clayton Grays The Blood and Thunderers The Rough and Readys all had their adherents Until matters were settled everyone referred to the organization as the Troop and despite the highsounding name finally adopted they were known to the end of their usefulness simply as The Troop The officers were elected by the members for no one in the County had had any military experience except a few veterans of the Mexican and Seminole wars and besides the Troop would have scorned a veteran as a leader if they had not personally liked him and trusted him Everyone liked the four Tarleton boys and the three Fontaines but regretfully refused to elect them because the Tarletons got lickered up too quickly and liked to skylark and the Fontaines had such quick murderous tempers Ashley Wilkes was elected captain because he was the best rider in the County and because his cool head was counted on to keep some semblance of order Raiford Calvert was made first lieutenant because everybody liked Raif and Abel Wynder son of a swamp trapper himself a small farmer was elected second lieutenant Abel was a shrewd grave giant illiterate kind of heart older than the other boys and with as good or better manners in the presence of ladies There was little snobbery in the Troop Too many of their fathers and grandfathers had come up to wealth from the small farmer class for that Moreover Abel was the best shot in the Troop a real sharpshooter who could pick out the eye of a squirrel at seventyfive yards and too he knew all about living outdoors building fires in the rain tracking animals and finding water The Troop bowed to real worth and moreover because they liked him they made him an officer He bore the honor gravely and with no untoward conceit as though it were only his due But the planters ladies and the planters slaves could not overlook the fact that he was not born a gentleman even if their men folks could In the beginning the Troop had been recruited exclusively from the sons of planters a gentlemans outfit each man supplying his own horse arms equipment uniform and body servant But rich planters were few in the young county of Clayton and in order to muster a fullstrength troop it had been necessary to raise more recruits among the sons of small farmers hunters in the backwoods swamp trappers Crackers and in a very few cases even poor whites if they were above the average of their class These latter young men were as anxious to fight the Yankees should war come as were their richer neighbors but the delicate question of money arose Few small farmers owned horses They carried on their farm operations with mules and they had no surplus of these seldom more than four The mules could not be spared to go off to war even if they had been acceptable for the Troop which they emphatically were not As for the poor whites they considered themselves well off if they owned one mule The backwoods folks and the swamp dwellers owned neither horses nor mules They lived entirely off the produce of their lands and the game in the swamp conducting their business generally by the barter system and seldom seeing five dollars in cash a year and horses and uniforms were out of their reach But they were as fiercely proud in their poverty as the planters were in their wealth and they would accept nothing that smacked of charity from their rich neighbors So to save the feelings of all and to bring the Troop up to full strength Scarletts father John Wilkes Buck Munroe Jim Tarleton Hugh Calvert in fact every large planter in the County with the one exception of Angus Macintosh had contributed money to completely outfit the Troop horse and man The upshot of the matter was that every planter agreed to pay for equipping his own sons and a certain number of the others but the manner of handling the arrangements was such that the less wealthy members of the outfit could accept horses and uniforms without offense to their honor The Troop met twice a week in Jonesboro to drill and to pray for the war to begin Arrangements had not yet been completed for obtaining the full quota of horses but those who had horses performed what they imagined to be cavalry maneuvers in the field behind the courthouse kicked up a great deal of dust yelled themselves hoarse and waved the Revolutionarywar swords that had been taken down from parlor walls Those who as yet had no horses sat on the curb in front of Bullards store and watched their mounted comrades chewed tobacco and told yarns Or else engaged in shooting matches There was no need to teach any of the men to shoot Most Southerners were born with guns in their hands and lives spent in hunting had made Gone With The Wind marksmen of them all From planters homes and swamp cabins a varied array of firearms came to each muster There were long squirrel guns that had been new when first the Alleghenies were crossed old muzzleloaders that had claimed many an Indian when Georgia was new horse pistols that had seen service in  in the Seminole wars and in Mexico silvermounted dueling pistols pocket derringers doublebarreled hunting pieces and handsome new rifles of English make with shining stocks of fine wood Drill always ended in the saloons of Jonesboro and by nightfall so many fights had broken out that the officers were hard put to ward off casualties until the Yankees could inflict them It was during one of these brawls that Stuart Tarleton had shot Cade Calvert and Tony Fontaine had shot Brent The twins had been at home freshly expelled from the University of Virginia at the time the Troop was organized and they had joined enthusiastically but after the shooting episode two months ago their mother had packed them off to the state university with orders to stay there They had sorely missed the excitement of the drills while away and they counted education well lost if only they could ride and yell and shoot off rifles in the company of their friends Well lets cut across country to Abels suggested Brent We can go through Mr OHaras river bottom and the Fontaines pasture and get there in no time We ain gwine git nothin ter eat cept possum an greens argued Jeems You aint

manners same as she taught yall She didnt do a very good job on any of the three of us said Stuart Come on lets get going He backed his big red horse and then putting spurs to his side lifted him easily over the split rail fence into the soft field of Gerald OHaras plantation Brents horse followed and then Jeems with Jeems clinging to pommel and mane Jeems did not like to jump fences but he had jumped higher ones than this in order to keep up with his masters As they picked their way across the red furrows and down the hill to the river bottom in the deepening dusk Brent yelled to his brother Look Stu Dont it seem like to you that Scarlett would have asked us to supper I kept thinking she would yelled Stuart Why do you suppose  CHAPTER II WHEN THE TWINS left Scarlett standing on the porch of Tara and the last sound of flying hooves had died away she went back to her chair like a sleepwalker Her face felt stiff as from pain and her mouth actually hurt from having stretched it unwillingly in smiles to prevent the twins from learning her secret She sat down wearily tucking one foot under her and her heart swelled up with misery until it felt too large for her bosom It beat with odd little jerks her hands were cold and a feeling of disaster oppressed her There were pain and bewilderment in her face the bewilderment of a pampered child who has always had her own way for the asking and who now for the first time was in contact with the unpleasantness of life Ashley to marry Melanie Hamilton Oh it couldnt be true The twins were mistaken They were playing one of their jokes on her Ashley couldnt couldnt be in love with her Nobody could not with a mousy little person like Melanie Scarlett recalled with contempt Melanies thin childish figure her serious heartshaped face that was plain almost to homeliness And Ashley couldnt have seen her in months He hadnt been in Atlanta more than twice since the house party he gave last year at Twelve Oaks No Ashley couldnt be in love with Melanie becauseoh she couldnt be mistakenbecause he was in love with her She Scarlett was the one he lovedshe knew it Scarlett heard Mammys lumbering tread shaking the floor of the hall and she hastily untucked her foot and tried to rearrange her face in more placid lines It would never do for Mammy to suspect that anything was wrong Mammy felt that she owned the OHaras body and soul that their secrets were her secrets and even a hint of a mystery was enough to set her upon the trail as re lentlessly as a bloodhound Scarlett knew from experience that if Mammys curiosity were not immediately satisfied she would take up the matter with Ellen and then Scarlett would be forced to reveal everything to her mother or think up some plausible lie Mammy emerged from the hall a huge old woman with the small shrewd eyes of an elephant She was shining black pure African devoted to her last drop of blood to the OHaras Ellens mainstay the despair of her three daughters the terror of the other house servants Mammy was black but her code of conduct and her sense of pride were as high as or higher than those of her owners She had been raised in the bedroom of Solange Robillard Ellen OHaras mother a dainty cold highnosed French woman who spared neither her children nor her servants their just punishment for any infringement of decorum She had been Ellens mammy and had come with her from Savannah to the upcountry when she married Whom Mammy loved she chastened And as her love for Scarlett and her pride in her were enormous the chastening process was practically continuous Is de gempmum gone Huccome you din ast dem ter stay fer supper Miss Scarlett Ah done tole Poke ter lay two extry Gone With The Wind plates fer dem Whars yo manners Oh I was so tired of hearing them talk about the war that I couldnt have endured it through supper especially with Pa joining in and shouting about Mr Lincoln You ain got no mo manners dan a feel han an affer Miss Ellen an me done labored wid you An hyah you is widout yo shawl An de night air fixin ter set in Ah done tole you an tole you bout gittin fever frum settin in de night air wid nuthin on yo shoulders Come on in de house Miss Scarlett Scarlett turned away from Mammy with studied nonchalance thankful that her face had been unnoticed in Mammys preoccupation with the matter of the shawl No I want to sit here and watch the sunset Its so pretty You run get my shawl Please Mammy and Ill sit here till Pa comes home Yo voice soun lak you catchin a cole said Mammy suspiciously Well Im not said Scarlett Impatiently You fetch me my shawl Mammy waddled back into the hall and Scarlett heard her call softly up the stairwell to the upstairs maid You Rosa Drap me Miss Scarletts shawl Then more loudly Wuthless nigger She ain never whar she does nobody no good Now Ah got ter climb up an git it mahseff Scarlett heard the stairs groan and she got softly to her feet When Mammy returned she would resume her lecture on Scarletts breach of hospitality and Scarlett felt that she could not endure prating about such a trivial matter when her heart was breaking As she stood hesitant wondering where she could hide until the ache in her breast subsided a little a thought came to her bringing a small ray of hope Her father had ridden over to Twelve Oaks the Wilkes plantation that afternoon to offer to buy Dilcey the broad wife of his valet Pork Dilcey was head woman and midwife at Twelve Oaks and since the marriage six months ago Pork had deviled his master night and day to buy Dilcey so the two could live on the same plantation That afternoon Gerald his resistance worn thin had set out to make an offer for Dilcey Surely thought Scarlett Pa will know whether this awful story is true Even if he hasnt actually heard anything this afternoon perhaps hes noticed something sensed some excitement in the Wilkes family If I can just see him privately before supper perhaps Ill find out the truththat its just one of the twins nasty practical jokes It was time for Geralds return and if she expected to see him alone there was nothing for her to do except meet him where the driveway entered the road She went quietly down the front steps looking carefully over her shoulder to make sure Mammy was not observing her from the upstairs windows Seeing no broad black face turbaned in snowy white peering disapprovingly from between fluttering curtains she boldly snatched up her green flowered skirts and sped down the path toward the driveway as fast as her small ribbonlaced slippers would carry her The dark cedars on either side of the graveled drive met in an arch overhead turning the long avenue into a dim tunnel As soon as she was beneath the gnarled arms of the cedars she knew she was safe from observation from the house and she slowed her swift pace She was panting for her stays were laced too tightly to permit much running but she walked on as rapidly as she could Soon she was at the end of the driveway and out on the main road but she did not stop until she had rounded a curve that put a large clump of trees between her and the house Flushed and breathing hard she sat down on a stump to wait for her father It was past time for him to come home but she was glad that he was late The delay would give her time to quiet her breathing and calm her face so that his suspicions would not be aroused Every moment she expected to hear the pounding of his horses hooves and see him come charging up the hill at his usual breakneck speed But the minutes slipped by and Gerald did not come She looked down the road for him the pain in her heart swelling up again Oh it cant be true she thought Why doesnt he come Her eyes followed the winding road bloodred now after the morning rain In her thought she traced its course as it ran down the hill to the sluggish Flint River through the tangled swampy bottoms and up the next hill to Twelve Oaks where Ashley lived That was all the road meant nowa road to Ashley and the beautiful whitecolumned house that crowned the hill like a Greek Temple Oh Ashley Ashley she thought and her heart beat faster Some of the cold sense of bewilderment and disaster that had weighted her down since the Tarleton boys told her their gossip was pushed into the background of her mind and in its place crept the fever that had possessed her for two years It seemed strange now that when she was growing up Ashley had never seemed so very attractive to her In childhood days she had seen him come and go and never given him a thought But since that day two years ago when Ashley newly home from his three years Grand Tour in Europe had called to pay his respects she had loved him It was as simple as that She had been on the front porch and he had ridden up the long avenue dressed in gray broadcloth with a wide black cravat setting off his frilled shirt to perfection Even now she could recall each detail of his dress how brightly his boots shone the head of a Medusa in cameo on his cravat phi the wide Panama hat that was instantly in his hand when he saw her He had alighted and tossed his bridle reins to a pickaninny and stood looking up at her his drowsy gray eyes wide with a smile and the sun so bright on his blond hair that it seemed like a cap of shining silver And he said So youve grown up Scarlett And coming lightly up the steps he had kissed her hand And his voice She would never forget the leap of her heart as she heard it as if for the first time drawling resonant musical She had wanted him in that first instant wanted him as simply and unreasoningly as she wanted food to eat horses to ride and a soft bed on which to lay herself For two years he had squired her about the County to balls fish fries picnics and court days never so often as the Tarleton twins or Cade Calvert never so importunate as the younger Fontaine boys but still never the week went by that Ashley did not come calling at Tara True he never made love to her nor did the clear gray eyes ever glow with that hot light Scarlett knew so well in other men And yetand yetshe knew he loved her She could not be mistaken about it Instinct stronger than reason and knowledge born Gone With The Wind of experience told her that he loved her Too often she had surprised him when his eyes were neither drowsy nor remote when he looked at her with a yearning and a sadness which puzzled her She knew he loved her Why did he not tell her so That she could not understand But there were so many things about him that she did not understand He was courteous always but aloof remote No one could ever tell what he was thinking about Scarlett least of all In a neighborhood where everyone said exactly what he thought as soon as he thought it Ashleys quality of reserve was exasperating He was as proficient as any of the other young men in the usual County diversions hunting gambling dancing and politics and was the best rider of them all but he differed from all the rest in that these pleasant activities were not the end and aim of life to him And he stood alone in his interest in books and music and his fondness for writing poetry Oh why was he so handsomely blond so courteously aloof so maddeningly boring with his talk about Europe and books and music and poetry and things that interested her not at alland yet so desirable Night after night when Scarlett went to bed after sitting on the front porch in the semidarkness with him she tossed restlessly for hours and comforted herself only with the thought that the very next time he saw her he certainly would propose But the next time came and went and the result was noth ingnothing except that the fever possessing her rose higher and hotter She loved him and she wanted him and she did not understand him She was as forthright and simple as the winds that blew over Tara and the yellow river that wound about it and to the end of her days she would never be able to understand a complexity And now for the first time in her life she was facing a complex nature For Ashley was born of a line of men who used their leisure for thinking not doing for spinning brightly colored dreams that had in them no touch of reality He moved in an inner world that was more beautiful than Georgia and came back to reality with reluctance He looked on people and he neither liked nor disliked them He looked on life and was neither heartened nor sad dened He accepted the universe and his place in it for what they were and shrugging turned to his music and books and his better world Why he should have captivated Scarlett when his mind was a stranger to hers she did not know The very mystery of him excited her curiosity like a door that had neither lock nor key The things about him which she could not understand only made her love him more and his odd restrained courtship only served to increase her determination to have him for her own That he would propose some day she had never doubted for she was too young and too spoiled ever to have known defeat And now like a thunderclap had come this horrible news Ashley to marry Melanie It couldnt be true Why only last week when they were riding home at twilight from Fairhill he had said Scarlett I have something so important to tell you that I hardly know how to say it She had cast down her eyes demurely her heart beating with wild pleasure thinking the happy moment had come Then he had said Not now Were nearly home and there isnt time Oh Scarlett what a coward I am And putting spurs to his horse he had raced her up the hill to Tara Scarlett sitting on the stump thought of those words which had made her so happy and suddenly they took on another meaning a hideous meaning Suppose it was the news of his engagement he had intended to tell her Oh if Pa would only come home She could not endure the suspense another moment She looked impatiently down the road again and again she was disappointed The sun was now below the horizon and the red glow at the rim of the world faded into pink The sky above turned slowly from azure to the delicate bluegreen of a robins egg and the unearthly stillness of rural twilight came stealthily down about her Shadowy dimness crept over the countryside The red furrows and the gashed red road lost their magical blood color and became plain brown earth Across the road in the pasture the horses mules and cows stood quietly with heads over the splitrail fence waiting to be driven to the stables and supper They did not like the dark shade of the thickets hedging the pasture creek and they twitched their ears at Scarlett as if appreciative of human companionship In the strange halflight the tall pines of the river swamp so warmly green in the sunshine were black against the pastel sky an impenetrable row of black giants hiding the slow yellow water at their feet On the hill across the river the tall white chimneys of the Wilkes home faded gradually into the darkness of the thick oaks surrounding them and only faroff pin points of supper lamps showed that a house was here The warm damp balminess of spring encompassed her sweetly with the moist smells of newplowed earth and all the fresh green things pushing up to the air Sunset and spring and newfledged greenery were no miracle to Scarlett Their beauty she accepted as casually as the air she breathed and the water she drank for she had never consciously seen beauty in anything bat womens faces horses silk dresses and like tangible things Yet the serene halflight over Taras wellkept acres brought a measure of quiet to her disturbed mind She loved this land so much without even knowing she loved it loved it as she loved her mothers face under the lamp at prayer time Still there was no sign of Gerald on the quiet winding road If she had to wait much longer Mammy would certainly come in search of her and bully her into the house But even as she strained her eyes down the darkening road she heard a pounding of hooves at the bottom of the pasture hill and saw the horses and cows scatter in fright Gerald OHara was coming home across country and at top speed He came up the hill at a gallop on his thickbarreled longlegged hunter appearing in the distance like a boy on a too large horse His long white hair standing out behind him he urged the horse forward with crop and loud cries Filled with her own anxieties she nevertheless watched him with affectionate pride for Gerald was an excellent horseman I wonder why he always wants to jump fences when hes had a few drinks she thought And after that fall he had right here last year when he broke his knee Youd think hed learn Especially when he promised Mother on oath hed never jump again Scarlett had no awe of her father and felt him more her contemporary than her sisters for jumping fences and keeping it a secret from his wife gave him a boyish pride and guilty glee that matched her own pleasure in outwitting Mammy She rose from her seat to watch him The big horse reached the fence gathered himself and soared over as effortlessly as a bird his rider yelling enthusiastically his crop beating the air his white curls jerking out behind him Gerald did not see his daughter in the shadow of the trees and he drew rein in the road patting his horses neck with approbation  Page    Gone With The Wind Theres none in the County can touch you nor in the state he informed his mount with pride the brogue of County Meath still heavy on his tongue in spite of thirtynine years in America Then he hastily set about smoothing his hair and settling his ruffled shirt and his cravat which had slipped awry behind one ear Scarlett knew these hurried preenings were being made with an eye toward meeting his wife with the appearance of a gentleman who had ridden sedately home from a call on a neighbor She knew also that he was presenting her with just the opportunity she wanted for opening the conversation without revealing her true purpose She laughed aloud As she had intended Gerald was startled by the sound then he recognized her and a look both sheepish and defiant came over his florid face He dismounted with difficulty because his knee was stiff and slipping the reins over his arm stumped toward her Well Missy he said pinching her cheek so youve been spying on me and like your sister Suellen last week youll be telling your mother on me There was indignation in his hoarse bass voice but also a wheedling note and Scarlett teasingly clicked her tongue against her teeth as she reached out to pull his cravat into place His breath in her face was strong with Bourbon whisky mingled with a faint fragrance of mint Accompanying him also were the smells of chewing tobacco welloiled leather and horsesa combination of odors that she always associated with her father and instinctively liked in other men No Pa Im no tattletale like Suellen she assured him standing off to view his rearranged attire with a judicious air Gerald was a small man little more than five feet tall but so heavy of barrel and thick of neck that his appearance when seated led strangers to think him a larger man His thickset torso was supported by short sturdy legs always incased in the finest leather boots procurable and always planted wide apart like a swaggering small boys Most small people who take themselves seriously are a little ridiculous but the bantam cock is respected in the barnyard and so it was with Gerald No one would ever have the temerity to think of Gerald OHara as a ridiculous little figure He was sixty years old and his crisp curly hair was silverwhite but his shrewd face was unlined and his hard little blue eyes were young with the unworried youthfulness of one who has never taxed his brain with problems more abstract than how many cards to draw in a poker game His was as Irish a face as could be found in the length and breadth of the homeland he had left so long agoround high colored short nosed wide mouthed and belligerent Beneath his choleric exterior Gerald OHara had the tenderest of hearts He could not bear to see a slave pouting under a reprimand ho matter how well deserved or hear a kitten mewing or a child crying but he had a horror of having this weakness discovered That everyone who met him did discover his kindly heart within five minutes was unknown to him and his vanity would have suffered tremendously if he had found it out for he liked to think that when he bawled orders at the top of his voice everyone trembled and obeyed It had never occurred to him that only one voice was obeyed on the plantationthe soft voice of his wife Ellen It was a secret he would never learn for everyone from Ellen down to the stupidest field hand was in a tacit and kindly conspiracy to keep him believing that his word was law Scarlett was impressed less than anyone else by his tempers and his roarings She was his oldest child and now that Gerald knew there would be no more sons to follow the three who lay in the family burying ground he had drifted into a habit of treating her in a mantoman manner which she found most pleasant She was more like her father than her younger sisters for Carreen who had been born Caroline Irene was delicate and dreamy and Suellen christened Susan Elinor prided herself on her elegance and ladylike deportment Moreover Scarlett and her father were bound together by a mutual suppression agreement If Gerald caught her climbing a fence instead of walking half a mile to a gate or sitting too late on the front steps with a beau he castigated her personally and with vehemence but he did not mention the fact to Ellen or to Mammy And when Scarlett discovered him jumping fences after his solemn promise to his wife or learned the exact amount of his losses at poker as she always did from County gossip she refrained from mentioning the fact at the supper table in the artfully artless manner Suellen had Scarlett and her father each assured the other solemnly that to bring such matters to the ears of Ellen would only hurt her and nothing would induce them to wound her gentleness Scarlett looked at her father in the fading light and without knowing why she found it comforting to be in his presence There was something vital and earthy and coarse about him that appealed to her Being the least analytic of people she did not realize that this was because she possessed in some degree these same qualities despite sixteen years of effort on the part of Ellen and Mammy to obliterate them You look very presentable now she said and I dont think anyone will suspect youve been up to your tricks unless you brag about them But it does seem to me that after you broke your knee last year jumping that same fence Well may I be damned if Ill have me own daughter telling me what I shall jump and not jump he shouted giving her cheek another pinch Its me own neck so it is And besides Missy what are you doing out here without your shawl Seeing that he was employing familiar maneuvers to extricate himself from unpleasant conversation she slipped her arm through his and said I was waiting for you I didnt know you would be so late I just wondered if you had bought Dilcey Bought her I did and the price has ruined me Bought her and her little wench Prissy John Wilkes was for almost giving them away but never will I have it said that Gerald OHara used friendship in a trade I made him take three thousand for the two of them In the name of Heaven Pa three thousand And you didnt need to buy Prissy Has the time come when me own daughters sit in judgment on me shouted Gerald rhetorically Prissy is a likely little wench and so I know her Shes a sly stupid creature Scarlett rejoined calmly unimpressed by his uproar And the only reason you bought her was because Dilcey asked you to buy her Gerald looked crestfallen and embarrassed as always when caught in a kind deed and Scarlett laughed outright at his transparency Well what if I did Was there any use buying Dilcey if she was going to mope about the child Well never again will I let a  Page    Gone With The Wind darky on this place marry off it Its too expensive Well come on Puss lets go in to supper The shadows were falling thicker now the last greenish tinge had left the sky and a slight chill was displacing the balminess of spring But Scarlett loitered wondering how to bring up the subject of Ashley without permitting Gerald to suspect her motive This was difficult for Scarlett had not a subtle bone in her body and Gerald was so much like her he never failed to penetrate her weak subterfuges even as she penetrated his And he was seldom tactful in doing it How are they all over at Twelve Oaks About as usual Cade Calvert was there and after I settled about Dilcey we all set on the gallery and had several toddies Cade has just come from Atlanta and its all upset they are there and talking war and Scarlett sighed If Gerald once got on the subject of war and secession it would be hours before he relinquished it She broke in with another line Did they say anything about the barbecue tomorrow Now that I think of it they did Misswhatshernamethe sweet little thing who was here last year you know Ashleys cousinoh yes Miss Melanie Hamilton thats the nameshe and her brother Charles have already come from Atlanta and Oh so she did come She did and a sweet quiet thing she is with never a word to say for herself like a woman should be Come now daughter dont lag Your mother will be hunting for us Scarletts heart sank at the news She had hoped against hope that something would keep Melanie Hamilton in Atlanta where she belonged and the knowledge that even her father approved of her sweet quiet nature so different from her own forced her into the open Was Ashley there too He was Gerald let go of his daughters arm and turned peering sharply into her face And if thats why you came out here to wait for me why didnt you say so without beating around the bush Scarlett could think of nothing to say and she felt her face growing red with annoyance Well speak up Still she said nothing wishing that it was permissible to shake ones father and tell him to hush his mouth He was there and he asked most kindly after you as did his sisters and said they hoped nothing would keep you from the barbecue tomorrow Ill warrant nothing will he said shrewdly And now daughter whats all this about you and Ashley There is nothing she said shortly tugging at his arm Lets go in Pa So now tis you wanting to go in he observed But here Im going to stand till Im understanding you Now that I think of it tis strange youve been recently Has he been trifling with you Has he asked to marry you No she said shortly Nor will he said Gerald Fury flamed in her but Gerald waved her quiet with a hand Hold your tongue Miss I had it from John Wilkes this afternoon in the strictest confidence that Ashleys to marry Miss Melanie Its to be announced tomorrow Scarletts hand fell from his arm So it was true A pain slashed at her heart as savagely as a wild animals fangs Through it all she felt her fathers eyes on her a little pitying a little annoyed at being faced with a problem for which he knew no answer He loved Scarlett but it made him uncomfortable to have her forcing her childish problems on him for a solution Ellen knew all the answers Scarlett should have taken her troubles to her Is it a spectacle youve been making of yourselfof all of us he bawled his voice rising as always in moments of excitement Have you been running after a man whos not in love with you when you could have any of the bucks in the County Anger and hurt pride drove out some of the pain I havent been running after him Itit just surprised me Its lying you are said Gerald and then peering at her stricken face he added in a burst of kindliness Im sorry daughter But after all you are nothing but a child and theres lots of other beaux Mother was only fifteen when she married you and Im sixteen said Scarlett her voice muffled Your mother was different said Gerald She was never flighty like you Now come daughter cheer up and Ill take you to Charleston next week to visit your Aunt Eulalie and what with all the hullabaloo they are having over there about Fort Sumter youll be forgetting about Ashley in a week He thinks Im a child thought Scarlett grief and anger choking utterance and hes only got to dangle a new toy and Ill forget my bumps Now dont be jerking your chin at me warned Gerald If you had any sense youd have married Stuart or Brent Tarleton long ago Think it over daughter Marry one of the twins and then the plantations will run together and Jim Tarleton and I will build you a fine house right where they join in that big pine grove and Will you stop treating me like a child cried Scarlett I dont want to go to Charleston or have a house or marry the twins I only want She caught herself but not in time Geralds voice was strangely quiet and he spoke slowly as if drawing his words from a store of thought seldom used Its only Ashley youre wanting and youll not be having him And if he wanted to marry you twould be with misgivings that Id say Yes for an the fine friendship thats between me and John Wilkes And seeing her startled look he continued I want my girl to be happy and you wouldnt be happy with him Oh I would I would That you would not daughter Only when like marries like can there be any happiness Scarlett had a sudden treacherous desire to cry out But youve been happy and you and Mother arent alike but she  Page    Gone With The Wind repressed it fearing that he would box her ears for her impertinence Our people and the Wilkes are different he went on slowly fumbling for words The Wilkes are different from any of our neighborsdifferent from any family I ever knew They are queer folk and its best that they marry their cousins and keep their queerness to themselves Why Pa Ashley is not Hold your whist Puss I said nothing against the lad for I like him And when I say queer its not crazy Im meaning Hes not queer like the Calverts whod gamble everything they have on a horse or the Tarletons who turn out a drunkard or two in every litter or the Fontaines who are hotheaded little brutes and after murdering a man for a fancied slight That kind of queerness is easy to understand for sure and but for the grace of God Gerald OHara would be having all those faults And I dont mean that Ashley would run off with another woman if you were his wife or beat you Youd be happier if he did for at least youd be understanding that But hes queer in other ways and theres no understanding him at all I like him but its neither heads nor tails I can make of most he says Now Puss tell me true do you understand his folderol about books and poetry and music and oil paintings and such foolishness Oh Pa cried Scarlett impatiently if I married him Id change all that Oh you would would you now Said Gerald testily shooting a sharp look at her Then its little enough you are knowing of any man living let alone Ashley No wife has ever changed a husband one whit and dont you be forgetting that And as for changing a WilkesGods nightgown daughter The whole family is that way and theyve always been that way And probably always will I tell you theyre born queer Look at the way they go tearing up to New York and Boston to hear operas and see oil paintings And ordering French and German books by the crate from the Yankees And there they sit reading and dreaming the dear God knows what when theyd be better spending their time hunting and playing poker as proper men should Theres nobody in the County sits a horse better than Ashley said Scarlett furious at the slur of effeminacy flung on Ashley nobody except maybe his father And as for poker didnt Ashley take two hundred dollars away from you just last week in Jonesboro The Calvert boys have been blabbing again Gerald said resignedly else youd not be knowing the amount Ashley can ride with the best and play poker with the bestthats me Puss And Im not denying that when he sets out to drink he can put even the Tarletons under the table He can do all those things but his hearts not in it Thats why I say hes queer Scarlett was silent and her heart sank She could think of no defense for this last for she knew Gerald was right Ashleys heart was in none of the pleasant things he did so well He was never more than politely interested in any of the things that vitally interested every one else Rightly interpreting her silence Gerald patted her arm and said triumphantly There now Scarlett You admit tis true What would you be doing with a husband like Ashley Tis moonstruck they all are all the Wilkes And then in a wheedling tone When I was mentioning the Tarletons the while ago I wasnt pushing them Theyre fine lads but if its Cade Calvert youre setting your cap after why tis the same with me The Calverts are good folk all of them for all the old man marrying a Yankee And when Im goneWhist darlin listen to me Ill leave Tara to you and Cade I wouldnt have Cade on a silver tray cried Scarlett in fury And I wish youd quit pushing him at me I dont want Tara or any old plantation Plantations dont amount to anything when She was going to say when you havent the man you want but Gerald incensed by the cavalier way in which she treated his proffered gift the thing which next to Ellen he loved best in the whole world uttered a roar Do you stand there Scarlett OHara and tell me that Tarathat landdoesnt amount to anything Scarlett nodded obstinately Her heart was too sore to care whether or not she put her father in a temper Land is the only thing in the world that amounts to anything he shouted his thick short arms making wide gestures of indignation for tis the only thing in this world that lasts and dont you be forgetting it Tis the only thing worth working for worth fighting forworth dying for Oh Pa she said disgustedly you talk like an Irishman Have I ever been ashamed of it No tis proud I am And dont be forgetting that you are half Irish Miss And to anyone with a drop of Irish blood in them the land they live on is like their mother Tis ashamed of you I am this minute I offer you the most beautiful land in the worldsaving County Meath in the Old Countryand what do you do You sniff Gerald had begun to work himself up into a pleasurable shouting rage when something in Scarletts woebegone face stopped him But there youre young Twill come to you this love of land Theres no getting away from it if youre Irish Youre just a child and bothered about your beaux When youre older youll be seeing how tis  Now do you be making up your mind about Cade or the twins or one of Evan Munroes young bucks and see how fine I turn you out Oh Pa By this time Gerald was thoroughly tired of the conversation and thoroughly annoyed that the problem should be upon his shoulders He felt aggrieved moreover that Scarlett should still look desolate after being offered the best of the County boys and Tara too Gerald liked his gifts to be received with clapping of hands and kisses Now none of your pouts Miss It doesnt matter who you marry as long as he thinks like you and is a gentleman and a Southerner and prideful For a woman love comes after marriage Oh Pa thats such an Old Country notion And a good notion it is All this American business of running around marrying for love like servants like Yankees The best marriages are when the parents choose for the girl For how can a silly piece like yourself tell a good man from a scoundrel Now look at the Wilkes Whats kept them prideful and strong all these generations Why marrying the likes of themselves marrying the cousins their family always expects them to marry Oh cried Scarlett fresh pain striking her as Geralds words brought home the terrible inevitability of the truth Gerald looked at her bowed head and shuffled his feet uneasily  Page    Gone With The Wind Its not crying you are he questioned fumbling clumsily at her chin trying to turn her face upward his own face furrowed with pity No she cried vehemently jerking away Its lying you are and Im proud of it Im glad theres pride in you Puss And I want to see pride in you tomorrow at the barbecue Ill not be having the County gossiping and laughing at you for mooning your heart out about a man who never gave you a thought beyond friendship He did give me a thought thought Scarlett sorrowfully in her heart Oh a lot of thoughts I know he did I could tell If Id just had a little longer I know I could have made him sayOh if it only wasnt that the Wilkes always feel that they have to marry their cousins Gerald took her arm and passed it through his Well be going in to supper now and all this is between us Ill not be worrying your mother with thisnor do you do it either Blow your nose daughter Scarlett blew her nose on her torn handkerchief and they started up the dark drive arm in arm the horse following slowly Near the house Scarlett was at the point of speaking again when she saw her mother in the dim shadows of the porch She had on her bonnet shawl and mittens and behind her was Mammy her face like a thundercloud holding in her hand the black leather bag in which Ellen OHara always carried the bandages and medicines she used in doctoring the slaves Mammys lips were large and pendulous and when indignant she could push out her lower one to twice its normal length It was pushed out now and Scarlett knew that Mammy was seething over something of which she did not approve Mr OHara called Ellen as she saw the two coming up the drivewayEllen belonged to a generation that was formal even after seventeen years of wedlock and the bearing of six childrenMr OHara there is illness at the Slattery house Emmies baby has been born and is dying and must be baptized I am going there with Mammy to see what I can do Her voice was raised questioningly as though she hung on Geralds assent to her plan a mere formality but one dear to the heart of Gerald In the name of God blustered Gerald Why should those white trash take you away just at your supper hour and just when Im wanting to tell you about the war talk thats going on in Atlanta Go Mrs OHara Youd not rest easy on your pillow the night if there was trouble abroad and you not there to help She doan never git no res on her piller fer hoppin up at night time nursin niggers an po wite trash dat could ten to deyseff grumbled Mammy in a monotone as she went down the stairs toward the carriage which was waiting in the side drive Take my place at the table dear said Ellen patting Scarletts cheek softly with a mittened hand In spite of her chokedback tears Scarlett thrilled to the neverfailing magic of her mothers touch to the faint fragrance of lemon verbena sachet that came from her rustling silk dress To Scarlett there was something breathtaking about Ellen OHara a miracle that lived in the house with her and awed her and charmed and soothed her Gerald helped his wife into the carriage and gave orders to the coachman to drive carefully Toby who had handled Geralds horses for twenty years pushed out his lips in mute indignation at being told how to conduct his own business Driving off with Mammy beside him each was a perfect picture of pouting African disapproval If I didnt do so much for those trashy Slatterys that theyd have to pay money for elsewhere fumed Gerald theyd be willing to sell me their miserable few acres of swamp bottom and the County would be well rid of them Then brightening in anticipation of one of his practical jokes Come daughter lets go tell Pork that instead of buying Dilcey Ive sold him to John Wilkes He tossed the reins of his horse to a small pickaninny standing near and started up the steps He had already forgotten Scarletts heartbreak and his mind was only on plaguing his valet Scarlett slowly climbed the steps after him her feet leaden She thought that after all a mating between herself and Ashley could be no queerer than that of her father and Ellen Robillard OHara As always she wondered how her loud insensitive father had managed to marry a woman like her mother for never were two people further apart in birth breeding and habits of mind CHAPTER III ELLEN OHARA was thirtytwo years old and according to the standards of her day she was a middleaged woman one who had borne six children and buried three She was a tall woman standing a head higher than her fiery little husband but she moved with such quiet grace in her swaying hoops that the height attracted no attention to itself Her neck rising from the black taffeta sheath of her basque was creamyskinned rounded and slender and it seemed always tilted slightly backward by the weight of her luxuriant hair in its net at the back of her head From her French mother whose parents had fled Haiti in the Revolution of  had come her slanting dark eyes shadowed by inky lashes and her black hair and from her father a soldier of Napoleon she had her long straight nose and her squarecut jaw that was softened by the gentle curving of her cheeks But only from life could Ellens face have acquired its look of pride that had no haughtiness its graciousness its melancholy and its utter lack of humor She would have been a strikingly beautiful woman had there been any glow in her eyes any responsive warmth in her smile or any spontaneity in her voice that fell with gentle melody on the ears of her family and her servants She spoke in the soft slurring voice of the coastal Georgian liquid of vowels kind to consonants and with the barest trace of French accent It was a voice never raised in command to a servant or reproof to a child but a voice that was obeyed instantly at Tara where her husbands blustering and roaring were quietly disregarded As far back as Scarlett could remember her mother had always been the same her voice soft and sweet whether in praising or in reproving her manner efficient and unruffled despite the daily emergencies of Geralds turbulent household her spirit always calm and her back unbowed even in the deaths of her three baby sons Scarlett had never seen her mothers back touch the back of any chair on which she sat Nor had she ever seen her sit down without a bit of needlework in her hands except at mealtime  Page    Gone With The Wind while attending the sick or while working at the bookkeeping of the plantation It was delicate embroidery if company were present but at other times her hands were occupied with Geralds ruffled shirts the girls dresses or garments for the slaves Scarlett could not imagine her mothers hands without her gold thimble or her rustling figure unaccompanied by the small negro girl whose sole function in life was to remove basting threads and carry the rosewood sewing box from room to room as Ellen moved about the house superintending the cooking the cleaning and the wholesale clothesmaking for the plantation She had never seen her mother stirred from her austere placidity nor her personal appointments anything but perfect no matter what the hour of day or night When Ellen was dressing for a ball or for guests or even to go to Jonesboro for Court Day it frequently required two hours two maids and Mammy to turn her out to her own satisfaction but her swift toilets in times of emergency were amazing Scarlett whose room lay across the hall from her mothers knew from babyhood the soft sound of scurrying bare black feet on the hardwood floor in the hours of dawn the urgent tappings on her mothers door and the muffled frightened negro voices that whispered of sickness and birth and death in the long row of whitewashed cabins in the quarters As a child she often had crept to the door and peeping through the tiniest crack had seen Ellen emerge from the dark room where Geralds snores were rhythmic and untroubled into the flickering light of an upheld candle her medicine case under her arm her hair smoothed neatly place and no button on her basque unlooped It had always been so soothing to Scarlett to hear her mother whisper firmly but compassionately as she tiptoed down the hall Hush not so loudly You will wake Mr OHara They are not sick enough to die Yes it was good to creep back into bed and know that Ellen was abroad in the night and everything was right In the mornings after allnight sessions at births and deaths when old Dr Fontaine and young Dr Fontaine were both out on calls and could not be found to help her Ellen presided at the breakfast table as usual her dark eyes circled with weariness but her voice and manner revealing none of the strain There was a steely quality under her stately gentleness that awed the whole household Gerald as well as the girls though he would have died rather than admit it Sometimes when Scarlett tiptoed at night to kiss her tall mothers cheek she looked up at the mouth with its too short too tender upper lip a mouth too easily hurt by the world and wondered if it had ever curved in silly girlish giggling or whispered secrets through long nights to intimate girl friends But no that wasnt possible Mother had always been just as she was a pillar of strength a fount of wisdom the one person who knew the answers to everything But Scarlett was wrong for years before Ellen Robillard of Savannah had giggled as inexplicably as any fifteenyearold in that charming coastal city and whispered the long nights through with friends exchanging confidences telling all secrets but one That was the year when Gerald OHara twentyeight years older than she came into her lifethe year too when youth and her blackeyed cousin Philippe Robillard went out of it For when Philippe with his snapping eyes and his wild ways left Savannah forever he took with him the glow that was in Ellens heart and left for the bandylegged little Irishman who married her only a gentle shell But that was enough for Gerald overwhelmed at his unbelievable luck in actually marrying her And if anything was gone from her he never missed it Shrewd man that he was he knew that it was no less than a miracle that he an Irishman with nothing of family and wealth to recommend him should win the daughter of one of the wealthiest and proudest families on the Coast For Gerald was a selfmade man Gerald had come to America from Ireland when he was twentyone He had come hastily as many a better and worse Irishman before and since with the clothes he had on his back two shillings above his passage money and a price on his head that he felt was larger than his misdeed warranted There was no Orangeman this side of hell worth a hundred pounds to the British government or to the devil himself but if the government felt so strongly about the death of an English absentee landlords rent agent it was time for Gerald OHara to be leaving and leaving suddenly True he had called the rent agent a bastard of an Orangeman but that according to Geralds way of looking at it did not give the man any right to insult him by whistling the opening bars of The Boyne Water The Battle of the Boyne had been fought more than a hundred years before but to the OHaras and their neighbors it might have been yesterday when their hopes and their dreams as well as their lands and wealth went off in the same cloud of dust that enveloped a frightened and fleeing Stuart prince leaving William of Orange and his hated troops with their orange cockades to cut down the Irish adherents of the Stuarts For this and other reasons Geralds family was not inclined to view the fatal outcome of this quarrel as anything very serious except for the fact that it was charged with serious consequences For years the OHaras had been in bad odor with the English constabulary on account of suspected activities against the government and Gerald was not the first OHara to take his foot in his hand and quit Ireland between dawn and morning His two oldest brothers James and Andrew he hardly remembered save as closelipped youths who came and went at odd hours of the night on mysterious errands or disappeared for weeks at a time to their mothers gnawing anxiety They had come to America years before after the discovery of a small arsenal of rifles buried under the OHara pigsty Now they were successful merchants in Savannah though the dear God alone knows where that may be as their mother always interpolated when mentioning the two oldest of her male brood and it was to them that young Gerald was sent He left home with his mothers hasty kiss on his cheek and her fervent Catholic blessing in his ears and his fathers parting admonition Remember who ye are and dont be taking nothing off no man His five tall brothers gave him goodby with admiring but slightly patronizing smiles for Gerald was the baby and the little one of a brawny family His five brothers and their father stood six feet and over and broad in proportion but little Gerald at twentyone knew that five feet four and a half inches was as much as the Lord in His wisdom was going to allow him It was like Gerald that he never wasted regrets on his lack of height and never found it an obstacle to his acquisition of anything he wanted Rather it was Geralds compact smallness that made him what he was for he had learned early that little people must be hardy to survive among large ones And Gerald was hardy  Page    Gone With The Wind His tall brothers were a grim quiet lot in whom the family tradition of past glories lost forever rankled in unspoken hate and crackled out in bitter humor Had Gerald been brawny he would have gone the way of the other OHaras and moved quietly and darkly among the rebels against the government But Gerald was loudmouthed and bullheaded as his mother fondly phrased it hair trigger of temper quick with his fists and possessed of a chip on his shoulder so large as to be almost visible to the naked eye He swaggered among the tall OHaras like a strutting bantam in a barnyard of giant Cochin roosters and they loved him baited him affectionately to hear him roar and hammered on him with their large fists no more than was necessary to keep a baby brother in his proper place If the educational equipment which Gerald brought to America was scant he did not even know it Nor would he have cared if he had been told His mother had taught him to read and to write a clear hand He was adept at ciphering And there his book knowledge stopped The only Latin he knew was the responses of the Mass and the only history the manifold wrongs of Ireland He knew no poetry save that of Moore and no music except the songs of Ireland that had come down through the years While he entertained the liveliest respect for those who had more book learning than he he never felt his own lack And what need had he of these things in a new country where the most ignorant of bogtrotters had made great fortunes in this country which asked only that a man be strong and unafraid of work Nor did James and Andrew who took him into their store in Savannah regret his lack of education His clear hand his accurate figures and his shrewd ability in bargaining won their respect where a knowledge of literature and a fine appreciation of music had young Gerald possessed them would have moved them to snorts of contempt America in the early years of the century had been kind to the Irish James and Andrew who had begun by hauling goods in covered wagons from Savannah to Georgias inland towns had prospered into a store of their own and Gerald prospered with them He liked the South and he soon became in his own opinion a Southerner There was much about the Southand Southernersthat he would never comprehend but with the wholeheartedness that was his nature he adopted its ideas and customs as he understood them for his ownpoker and horse racing redhot politics and the code duello States Rights and damnation to all Yankees slavery and King Cotton contempt for white trash and exaggerated courtesy to women He even learned to chew tobacco There was no need for him to acquire a good head for whisky he had been born with one But Gerald remained Gerald His habits of living and his ideas changed but his manners he would not change even had he been able to change them He admired the drawling elegance of the wealthy rice and cotton planters who rode into Savannah from their mosshung kingdoms mounted on thoroughbred horses and followed by the carriages of their equally elegant ladies and the wagons of their slaves But Gerald could never attain elegance Their lazy blurred voices fell pleasantly on his ears but his own brisk brogue clung to his tongue He liked the casual grace with which they conducted affairs of importance risking a fortune a plantation or a slave on the turn of a card and writing off their losses with careless good humor and no more ado than when they scattered pennies to pickaninnies But Gerald had known poverty and he could never learn to lose money with good humor or good grace They were a pleasant race these coastal Georgians with their softvoiced quick rages and their charming inconsistencies and Gerald liked them But there was a brisk and restless vitality about the young Irishman fresh from a country where winds blew wet and chill where misty swamps held no fevers that set him apart from these indolent gentlefolk of semitropical weather and malarial marshes From them he learned what he found useful and the rest he dismissed He found poker the most useful of all Southern customs poker and a steady head for whisky and it was his natural aptitude for cards and amber liquor that brought to Gerald two of his three most prized possessions his valet and his plantation The other was his wife and he could only attribute her to the mysterious kindness of God The valet Pork by name shining black dignified and trained in all the arts of sartorial elegance was the result of an allnight poker game with a planter from St Simons Island whose courage in a bluff equaled Geralds but whose head for New Orleans rum did not Though Porks former owner later offered to buy him back at twice his value Gerald obstinately refused for the possession of his first slave and that slave the best damn valet on the Coast was the first step upward toward his hearts desire Gerald wanted to be a slave owner and a landed gentleman His mind was made up that he was not going to spend all of his days like Tames and Andrew in bargaining or all his nights by candlelight over long columns of figures He felt keenly as his brothers did not the social stigma attached to those in trade Gerald wanted to be a planter With the deep hunger of an Irishman who has been a tenant on the lands his people once had owned and hunted he wanted to see his own acres stretching green before his eyes With a ruthless singleness of purpose he desired his own house his own plantation his own horse his own slaves And here in this new country safe from the twin perils of the land he had lefttaxation that ate up crops and barns and the everpresent threat of sudden confiscationhe intended to have them But having that ambition and bringing it to realization were two different matters he discovered as time went by Coastal Georgia was too firmly held by an entrenched aristocracy for him ever to hope to win the place he intended to have Then the hand of Fate and a hand of poker combined to give him the plantation which he afterwards called Tara and at the same time moved him out of the Coast into the upland country of north Georgia It was in a saloon in Savannah on a hot night in spring when the chance conversation of a stranger sitting near by made Gerald prick up his ears The stranger a native of Savannah had just returned after twelve years in the inland country He had been one of the winners in the land lottery conducted by the State to divide up the vast area in middle Georgia ceded by the Indians the year before Gerald came to America He had gone up there and established a plantation but now the house had burned down he was tired of the accursed place and would be most happy to get it off his hands Gerald his mind never free of the thought of owning a plantation of his own arranged an introduction and his interest grew as the stranger told how the northern section of the state was filling up with newcomers from the Carolinas and Virginia Gerald had lived in Savannah long enough to acquire a viewpoint of the Coastthat all of the rest of the state was backwoods with an Indian lurking in every thicket In transacting business for OHara Brothers he had visited Augusta a hundred miles up the Savannah River and he had traveled inland far enough to visit the old towns westward from that city He knew that section to be as well settled as the Coast but from the strangers description his plantation was more than two hundred and fifty miles inland from  Page    Gone With The Wind Savannah to the north and west and not many miles south of the Chattahoochee River Gerald knew that northward beyond that stream the land was still held by the Cherokees so it was with amazement that he heard the stranger jeer at suggestions of trouble with the Indians and narrate how thriving towns were growing up and plantations prospering in the new country An hour later when the conversation began to lag Gerald with a guile that belied the wide innocence of his bright blue eyes proposed a game As the night wore on and the drinks went round there came a time when all the others in the game laid down their hands and Gerald and the stranger were battling alone The stranger shoved in all his chips and followed with the deed to his plantation Gerald shoved in all his chips and laid on top of them his wallet If the money it contained happened to belong to the firm of OHara Brothers Geralds conscience was not sufficiently troubled to confess it before Mass the following morning He knew what he wanted and when Gerald wanted something he gained it by taking the most direct route Moreover such was his faith in his destiny and four deuces that he never for a moment wondered just how the money would be paid back should a higher hand be laid down across the table Its no bargain youre getting and I am glad not to have to pay more taxes on the place sighed the possessor of an ace full as he called for pen and ink The big house burned a year ago and the fields are growing up in brush and seedling pine But its yours Never mix cards and whisky unless you were weaned on Irish poteen Gerald told Pork gravely the same evening as Pork assisted him to bed And the valet who had begun to attempt a brogue out of admiration for his new master made requisite answer in a combination of Geechee and County Meath that would have puzzled anyone except those two alone The muddy Flint River running silently between walls of pine and water oak covered with tangled vines wrapped about Geralds new land like a curving arm and embraced it on two sides To Gerald standing on the small knoll where the house had been this tall barrier of green was as visible and pleasing an evidence of ownership as though it were a fence that he himself had built to mark his own He stood on the blackened foundation stones of the burned building looked down the long avenue of trees leading toward the road and swore lustily with a joy too deep for thankful prayer These twin lines of somber trees were his his the abandoned lawn waist high in weeds under whitestarred young magnolia trees The uncultivated fields studded with tiny pines and underbrush that stretched their rolling redclay surface away into the distance on four sides belonged to Gerald OHarawere all his because he had an unbefuddled Irish head and the courage to stake everything on a hand of cards Gerald closed his eyes and in the stillness of the unworked acres he felt that he had come home Here under his feet would rise a house of whitewashed brick Across the road would be new rail fences inclosing fat cattle and blooded horses and the red earth that rolled down the hillside to the rich river bottom land would gleam white as eiderdown in the suncotton acres and acres of cotton The fortunes of the OHaras would rise again With his own small stake what he could borrow from his unenthusiastic brothers and a neat sum from mortgaging the land Gerald bought his first field hands and came to Tara to live in bachelor solitude in the fourroom overseers house till such a time as the white walls of Tara should rise He cleared the fields and planted cotton and borrowed more money from James and Andrew to buy more slaves The OHaras were a clannish tribe clinging to one another in prosperity as well as in adversity not for any overweening family affection but because they had learned through grim years that to survive a family must present an unbroken front to the world They lent Gerald the money and in the years that followed the money came back to them with interest Gradually the plantation widened out as Gerald bought more acres lying near him and in time the white house became a reality instead of a dream It was built by slave labor a clumsy sprawling building that crowned the rise of ground overlooking the green incline of pasture land running down to the river and it pleased Gerald greatly for even when new it wore a look of mellowed years The old oaks which had seen Indians pass under their limbs hugged the house closely with their great trunks and towered their branches over the roof in dense shade The lawn reclaimed from weeds grew thick with clover and Bermuda grass and Gerald saw to it that it was well kept From the avenue of cedars to the row of white cabins in the slave quarters there was an air of solidness of stability and permanence about Tara and whenever Gerald galloped around the bend in the road and saw his own roof rising through green branches his heart swelled with pride as though each sight of it were the first sight He had done it all little hardheaded blustering Gerald Gerald was on excellent terms with all his neighbors in the County except the MacIntoshs whose land adjoined his on the left and the Slatterys whose meager three acres stretched on his right along the swamp bottoms between the river and John Wilkes plantation The MacIntoshs were ScotchIrish and Orangemen and had they possessed all the saintly qualities of the Catholic calendar this ancestry would have damned them forever in Geralds eyes True they had lived in Georgia for seventy years and before that had spent a generation in the Carolinas but the first of the family who set foot on American shores had come from Ulster and that was enough for Gerald They were a closemouthed and stiffnecked family who kept strictly to themselves and intermarried with their Carolina relatives and Gerald was not alone in disliking them for the County people were neighborly and sociable and none too tolerant of anyone lacking in those same qualities Rumors of Abolitionist sympathies did not enhance the popularity of the Macintoshes Old Angus had never manumitted a single slave and had committed the unpardonable social breach of selling some of his negroes to passing slave traders en route to the cane fields of Louisiana but the rumors persisted Hes an Abolitionist no doubt observed Gerald to John Wilkes But in an Orangeman when a principle comes up against Scotch tightness the principle fares ill The Slatterys were another affair Being poor white they were not even accorded the grudging respect that Angus Macintoshs dour independence wrung from neighboring families Old Slattery who clung persistently to his few acres in spite of repeated offers from Gerald and John Wilkes was shiftless and whining His wife was a snarlyhaired woman sickly and washedout of appearance the mother of a brood of sullen and rabbitylooking childrena brood which was increased regularly every year Tom Slattery owned no slaves and he and his two oldest boys spasmodically worked their few acres of cotton while the wife and younger children tended what was supposed to be a vegetable garden But somehow the cotton always failed and  Page    Gone With The Wind the garden due to Mrs Slatterys constant childbearing seldom furnished enough to feed her flock The sight of Tom Slattery dawdling on his neighbors porches begging cotton seed for planting or a side of bacon to tide him over was a familiar one Slattery hated his neighbors with what little energy he possessed sensing their contempt beneath their courtesy and especially did he hate rich folks uppity niggers The house negroes of the County considered themselves superior to white trash and their unconcealed scorn stung him while their more secure position in life stirred his envy By con trast with his own miserable existence they were wellfed wellclothed and looked after in sickness and old age They were proud of the good names of their owners and for the most part proud to belong to people who were quality while he was despised by all Tom Slattery could have sold his farm for three times its value to any of the planters in the County They would have considered it money well spent to rid the community of an eyesore but he was well satisfied to remain and to subsist miserably on the proceeds of a bale of cotton a year and the charity of his neighbors With all the rest of the County Gerald was on terms of amity and some intimacy The Wilkeses the Calverts the Tarletons the Fontaines all smiled when the small figure on the big white horse galloped up their driveways smiled and signaled for tall glasses in which a pony of Bourbon had been poured over a teaspoon of sugar and a sprig of crushed mint Gerald was likable and the neighbors learned in time what the children negroes and dogs discovered at first sight that a kind heart a ready and sympathetic ear and an open pocketbook lurked just behind his bawling voice and his truculent manner His arrival was always amid a bedlam of hounds barking and small black children shouting as they raced to meet him quarreling for the privilege of holding his horse and squirming and grinning under his goodnatured insults The white children clamored to sit on his knee and be trotted while he denounced to their elders the infamy of Yankee politicians the daughters of his friends took him into their confidence about their love affairs and the youths of the neighborhood fearful of confessing debts of honor upon the carpets of their fathers found him a friend in need So youve been owning this for a month you young rascal he would shout And in Gods name why havent you been asking me for the money before this His rough manner of speech was too well known to give offense and it only made the young men grin sheepishly and reply Well sir I hated to trouble you and my father Your fathers a good man and no denying it but strict and so take this and lets be hearing no more of it The planters ladies were the last to capitulate But when Mrs Wilkes a great lady and with a rare gift for silence as Gerald characterized her told her husband one evening after Geralds horse had pounded down the driveway He has a rough tongue but he is a gentleman Gerald had definitely arrived He did not know that he had taken nearly ten years to arrive for it never occurred to him that his neighbors had eyed him askance at first In his own mind there had never been any doubt that he belonged from the moment he first set foot on Tara When Gerald was fortythree so thickset of body and florid of face that he looked like a hunting squire out of a sporting print it came to him that Tara dear though it was and the County folk with their open hearts and open houses were not enough He wanted a wife Tara cried out for a mistress The fat cook a yard negro elevated by necessity to the kitchen never had the meals on time and the chambermaid formerly a field hand let dust accumulate on the furniture and never seemed to have clean linen on hand so that the arrival of guests was always the occasion of much stirring and todo Pork the only trained house negro on the place had general supervision over the other servants but even he had grown slack and careless after several years of exposure to Geralds happygolucky mode of living As valet he kept Geralds bedroom in order and as butler he served the meals with dignity and style but otherwise he pretty well let matters follow their own course With unerring African instinct the negroes had all discovered that Gerald had a loud bark and no bite at all and they took shameless advantage of him The air was always thick with threats of selling slaves south and of direful whippings but there never had been a slave sold from Tara and only one whipping and that administered for not grooming down Geralds pet horse after a long days hunting Geralds sharp blue eyes noticed how efficiently his neighbors houses were run and with what ease the smoothhaired wives in rustling skirts managed their servants He had no knowledge of the dawntillmidnight activities of these women chained to supervision of cooking nursing sewing and laundering He only saw the outward results and those results impressed him The urgent need of a wife became clear to him one morning when he was dressing to ride to town for Court Day Pork brought forth his favorite ruffled shirt so inexpertly mended by the chambermaid as to be unwearable by anyone except his valet Mist Gerald said Pork gratefully rolling up the shirt as Gerald fumed whut you needs is a wife and a wife whut has got pleny of house niggers Gerald upbraided Pork for his impertinence hut he knew that he was right He wanted a wife and he wanted children and if he did not acquire them soon it would be too late But he was not going to marry just anyone as Mr Calvert had done taking to wife the Yankee governess of his motherless children His wife must be a lady and a lady of blood with as many airs and graces as Mrs Wilkes and the ability to manage Tara as well as Mrs Wilkes ordered her own domain But there were two difficulties in the way of marriage into the County families The first was the scarcity of girls of marriageable age The second and more serious one was that Gerald was a new man despite his nearly ten years residence and a foreigner No one knew anything about his family While the society of upcountry Georgia was not so impregnable as that of the Coast aristocrats no family wanted a daughter to wed a man about whose grandfather nothing was known Gerald knew that despite the genuine liking of the County men with whom he hunted drank and talked politics there was hardly one whose daughter he could marry And he did not intend to have it gossiped about over supper tables that this that or the other father had regretfully refused to let Gerald OHara pay court to his daughter This knowledge did not make Gerald feel inferior to his neighbors Nothing could ever make Gerald feel that he was inferior in any way to anyone It was merely a quaint custom of the County that daughters only married into families who had lived in the South much longer than twentytwo years had owned land and slaves and been addicted only to the fashionable vices during that time  Page    Gone With The Wind Pack up Were going to Savannah he told Pork And if I hear you say Whist or Faith but once its selling you Ill be doing for they are words I seldom say meself James and Andrew might have some advice to offer on this subject of marriage and there might be daughters among their old friends who would both meet his requirements and find him acceptable as a husband James and Andrew listened to his story patiently but they gave him little encouragement They had no Savannah relatives to whom they might look for assistance for they had been married when they came to America And the daughters of their old friends had long since married and were raising small children of their own Youre not a rich man and you havent a great family said James Ive made me money and I can make a great family And I wont be marrying just anyone You fly high observed Andrew dryly But they did their best for Gerald James and Andrew were old men and they stood well in Savannah They had many friends and for a month they carried Gerald from home to home to suppers dances and picnics Theres only one who takes me eye Gerald said finally And she not even born when I landed here And who is it takes your eye Miss Ellen Robillard said Gerald trying to speak casually for the slightly tilting dark eyes of Ellen Robillard had taken more than his eye Despite a mystifying listlessness of manner so strange in a girl of fifteen she charmed him Moreover there was a haunting look of despair about her that went to his heart and made him more gentle with her than he had ever been with any person in all the world And you old enough to be her father And me in me prime cried Gerald stung James spoke gently Jerry theres no girl in Savannah youd have less chance of marrying Her father is a Robillard and those French are proud as Lucifer And her motherGod rest her soulwas a very great lady I care not said Gerald heatedly Besides her mother is dead and old man Robillard likes me As a man yes but as a soninlaw no The girl wouldnt have you anyway interposed Andrew Shes been in love with that wild buck of a cousin of hers Philippe Robillard for a year now despite her family being at her morning and night to give him up Hes been gone to Louisiana this month now said Gerald And how do you know I know answered Gerald who did not care to disclose that Pork had supplied this valuable bit of information or that Philippe had departed for the West at the express desire of his family And I do not think shes been so much in love with him that she wont forget him Fifteen is too young to know much about love Theyd rather have that breakneck cousin for her than you So James and Andrew were as startled as anyone when the news came out that the daughter of Pierre Robillard was to marry the little Irishman from up the country Savannah buzzed behind its doors and speculated about Philippe Robillard who had gone West but the gossiping brought no answer Why the loveliest of the Robillard daughters should marry a loudvoiced redfaced little man who came hardly up to her ears remained a mystery to all Gerald himself never quite knew how it all came about He only knew that a miracle had happened And for once in his life he was utterly humble when Ellen very white but very calm put a light hand on his arm and said I will marry you Mr OHara The thunderstruck Robillards knew the answer in part but only Ellen and her mammy ever knew the whole story of the night when the girl sobbed till the dawn like a brokenhearted child and rose up in the morning a woman with her mind made up With foreboding Mammy had brought her young mistress a small package addressed in a strange hand from New Orleans a package containing a miniature of Ellen which she flung to the floor with a cry four letters in her own handwriting to Philippe Robillard and a brief letter from a New Orleans priest announcing the death of her cousin in a barroom brawl They drove him away Father and Pauline and Eulalie They drove him away I hate them I hate them all I never want to see them again I want to get away I will go away where Ill never see them again or this town or anyone who reminds me ofofhim And when the night was nearly spent Mammy who had cried herself out over her mistress dark head protested But honey you kain do dat I will do it He is a kind man I will do it or go into the convent at Charleston It was the threat of the convent that finally won the assent of bewildered and heartstricken Pierre Robillard He was staunchly Presbyterian even though his family were Catholic and the thought of his daughter becoming a nun was even worse than that of her marrying Gerald OHara After all the man had nothing against him but a lack of family So Ellen no longer Robillard turned her back on Savannah never to see it again and with a middleaged husband Mammy and twenty house niggers journeyed toward Tara The next year their first child was born and they named her Katie Scarlett after Geralds mother Gerald was disappointed for he had wanted a son but he nevertheless was pleased enough over his small blackhaired daughter to serve rum to every slave at Tara and to get roaringly happily drunk himself If Ellen had ever regretted her sudden decision to marry him no one ever knew it certainly not Gerald who almost burst with pride whenever he looked at her She had put Savannah and its memories behind her when she left that gently mannered city by the sea and from the moment of her arrival in the County north Georgia was her home When she departed from her fathers house forever she had left a home whose lines were as beautiful and flowing as a womans body as a ship in full sail a pale pink stucco house built in the French colonial style set high from the ground in a dainty manner approached by swirling stairs banistered with wrought iron as delicate as lace a dim rich house gracious but aloof  Page    Gone With The Wind She had left not only that graceful dwelling but also the entire civilization that was behind the building of it and she found herself in a world that was as strange and different as if she had crossed a continent Here in north Georgia was a rugged section held by a hardy people High up on the plateau at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains she saw rolling red hills wherever she looked with huge outcroppings of the underlying granite and gaunt pines towering somberly everywhere It all seemed wild and untamed to her coastbred eyes accustomed to the quiet jungle beauty of the sea islands draped in their gray moss and tangled green the white stretches of beach hot beneath a semitropic sun the long flat vistas of sandy land studded with palmetto and palm This was a section that knew the chill of winter as well as the heat of summer and there was a vigor and energy in the people that was strange to her They were a kindly people courteous generous filled with abounding good nature but sturdy virile easy to anger The people of the Coast which she had left might pride themselves on taking all their affairs even their duels and their feuds with a careless air but these north Georgia people had a streak of violence in them On the coast life had mellowedhere it was young and lusty and new All the people Ellen had known in Savannah might have been cast from the same mold so similar were their view points and traditions but here was a variety of people North Georgias settlers were coming in from many different places from other parts of Georgia from the Carolinas and Virginia from Europe and the North Some of them like Gerald were new people seeking their fortunes Some like Ellen were members of old families who had found life intolerable in their former homes and sought haven in a distant land Many had moved for no reason at all except that the restless blood of pioneering fathers still quickened in their veins These people drawn from many different places and with many different backgrounds gave the whole life of the County an informality that was new to Ellen an informality to which she never quite accustomed herself She instinctively knew how Coast people would act in any circumstance There was never any telling what north Georgians would do And quickening all of the affairs of the section was the high tide of prosperity then rolling over the South All of the world was crying out for cotton and the new land of the County unworn and fertile produced it abundantly Cotton was the heartbeat of the section the planting and the picking were the diastole and systole of the red earth Wealth came out of the curving furrows and arrogance came tooarrogance built on green bushes and the acres of fleecy white If cotton could make them rich in one generation how much richer they would be in the next This certainty of the morrow gave zest and enthusiasm to life and the County people enjoyed life with a heartiness that Ellen could never understand They had money enough and slaves enough to give them time to play and they liked to play They seemed never too busy to drop work for a fish fry a hunt or a horse race and scarcely a week went by without its barbecue or ball Ellen never would or could quite become one of themshe had left too much of herself in Savannahbut she respected them and in time learned to admire the frankness and forthrightness of these people who had few reticences and who valued a man for what he was She became the bestloved neighbor in the County She was a thrifty and kind mistress a good mother and a devoted wife The heartbreak and selflessness that she would have dedicated to the Church were devoted instead to the service of her child her household and the man who had taken her out of Savannah and its memories and had never asked any questions When Scarlett was a year old and more healthy and vigorous than a girl baby had any right to be in Mammys opinion Ellens second child named Susan Elinor but always called Suellen was born and in due time came Carreen listed in the family Bible as Caroline Irene Then followed three little boys each of whom died before he had learned to walkthree little boys who now lay under the twisted cedars in the burying ground a hundred yards from the house beneath three stones each bearing the name of Gerald OHara Jr From the day when Ellen first came to Tara the place had been transformed If she was only fifteen years old she was nevertheless ready for the responsibilities of the mistress of a plantation Before marriage young girls must be above all other things sweet gentle beautiful and ornamental but after marriage they were expected to manage households that numbered a hundred people or more white and black and they were trained with that in view Ellen had been given this preparation for marriage which any wellbroughtup young lady received and she also had Mammy who could galvanize the most shiftless negro into energy She quickly brought order dignity and grace into Geralds household and she gave Tara a beauty it had never had before The house had been built according to no architectural plan whatever with extra rooms added where and when it seemed convenient but with Ellens care and attention it gained a charm that made up for its lack of design The avenue of cedars leading from the main road to the housethat avenue of cedars without which no Georgia planters home could be completehad a cool dark shadiness that gave a brighter tinge by contrast to the green of the other trees The wistaria tumbling over the verandas showed bright against the whitewashed brick and it joined with the pink crpe myrtle bushes by the door and the whiteblossomed magnolias in the yard to disguise some of the awkward lines of the house In spring time and summer the Bermuda grass and clover on the lawn became emerald so enticing an emerald that it presented an irresistible temptation to the flocks of turkeys and white geese that were supposed to roam only the regions in the rear of the house The elders of the flocks continually led stealthy advances into the front yard lured on by the green of the grass and the luscious promise of the cape jessamine buds and the zinnia beds Against their depredations a small black sentinel was stationed on the front porch Armed with a ragged towel the little negro boy sitting on the steps was part of the picture of Taraand an unhappy one for he was forbidden to chunk the fowls and could only flap the towel at them and shoo them Ellen set dozens of little black boys to this task the first position of responsibility a male slave had at Tara After they had passed their tenth year they were sent to old Daddy the plantation cobbler to learn his trade or to Amos the wheelwright and carpenter or Phillip the cow man or Cuffee the mule boy If they showed no aptitude for any of these trades they became field hands and in the opinion of the negroes they had lost their claim to any social standing at all Ellens life was not easy nor was it happy but she did not expect life to be easy and if it was not happy that was womans lot It was a mans world and she accepted it as such The man owned the property and the woman managed it The man took the  Page    Gone With The Wind credit for the management and the woman praised his cleverness The man roared like a bull when a splinter was in his finger and the woman muffled the moans of childbirth lest she disturb him Men were rough of speech and often drunk Women ignored the lapses of speech and put the drunkards to bed without bitter words Men were rude and outspoken women were al ways kind gracious and forgiving She had been reared in the tradition of great ladies which had taught her how to carry her burden and still retain her charm and she intended that her three daughters should be great ladies also With her younger daughters she had success for Suellen was so anxious to be attractive she lent an attentive and obedient ear to her mothers teachings and Carreen was shy and easily led But Scarlett child of Gerald found the road to ladyhood hard To Mammys indignation her preferred playmates were not her demure sisters or the wellbroughtup Wilkes girls but the negro children on the plantation and the boys of the neighborhood and she could climb a tree or throw a rock as well as any of them Mammy was greatly perturbed that Ellens daughter should display such traits and frequently adjured her to ack lak a lil lady But Ellen took a more tolerant and longsighted view of the matter She knew that from childhood playmates grew beaux in later years and the first duty of a girl was to get married She told herself that the child was merely full of life and there was still time in which to teach her the arts and graces of being attractive to men To this end Ellen and Mammy bent their efforts and as Scarlett grew older she became an apt pupil in this subject even though she learned little else Despite a succession of governesses and two years at the nearby Fayetteville Female Academy her education was sketchy but no girl in the County danced more gracefully than she She knew how to smile so that her dimples leaped how to walk pigeontoed so that her wide hoop skirts swayed entrancingly how to look up into a mans face and then drop her eyes and bat the lids rapidly so that she seemed atremble with gentle emotion Most of all she learned how to conceal from men a sharp intelligence beneath a face as sweet and bland as a babys Ellen by softvoiced admonition and Mammy by constant carping labored to inculcate in her the qualities that would make her truly desirable as a wife You must be more gentle dear more sedate Ellen told her daughter You must not interrupt gentlemen when they are speaking even if you do think you know more about matters than they do Gentlemen do not like forward girls Young misses whut frowns an pushes out dey chins an says Ah will and Ah woan mos generly doan ketch husbands prophesied Mammy gloomily Young misses should cas down dey eyes an say Well suh Ah mout an Jes as you say suh  Between them they taught her all that a gentlewoman should know but she learned only the outward signs of gentility The inner grace from which these signs should spring she never learned nor did she see any reason for learning it Appearances were enough for the appearances of ladyhood won her popularity and that was all she wanted Gerald bragged that she was the belle of five counties and with some truth for she had received proposals from nearly all the young men in the neighborhood and many from places as far away as Atlanta and Savannah At sixteen thanks to Mammy and Ellen she looked sweet charming and giddy but she was in reality selfwilled vain and obstinate She had the easily stirred passions of her Irish father and nothing except the thinnest veneer of her mothers unselfish and forbearing nature Ellen never fully realized that it was only a veneer for Scarlett always showed her best face to her mother concealing her escapades curbing her temper and appearing as sweetnatured as she could in Ellens presence for her mother could shame her to tears with a reproachful glance But Mammy was under no illusions about her and was constantly alert for breaks in the veneer Mammys eyes were sharper than Ellens and Scarlett could never recall in all her life having fooled Mammy for long It was not that these two loving mentors deplored Scarletts high spirits vivacity and charm These were traits of which Southern women were proud It was Geralds headstrong and impetuous nature in her that gave them concern and they sometimes feared they would not be able to conceal her damaging qualities until she had made a good match But Scarlett intended to marryand marry Ashleyand she was willing to appear demure pliable and scatterbrained if those were the qualities that attracted men Just why men should be this way she did not know She only knew that such methods worked It never interested her enough to try to think out the reason for it for she knew nothing of the inner workings of any human beings mind not even her own She knew only that if she did or said thusandso men would unerringly respond with the complementary thusandso It was like a mathematical formula and no more difficult for mathematics was the one subject that had come easy to Scarlett in her schooldays If she knew little about mens minds she knew even less about the minds of women for they interested her less She had never had a girl friend and she never felt any lack on that account To her all women including her two sisters were natural enemies in pursuit of the same preyman All women with the one exception of her mother Ellen OHara was different and Scarlett regarded her as something holy and apart from all the rest of humankind When Scarlett was a child she had confused her mother with the Virgin Mary and now that she was older she saw no reason for changing her opinion To her Ellen represented the utter security that only Heaven or a mother can give She knew that her mother was the embodiment of justice truth loving tenderness and profound wisdoma great lady Scarlett wanted very much to be like her mother The only difficulty was that by being just and truthful and tender and unselfish one missed most of the joys of life and certainly many beaux And life was too short to miss such pleasant things Some day when she was married to Ashley and old some day when she had time for it she intended to be like Ellen But until then  CHAPTER IV THAT NIGHT AT SUPPER Scarlett went through the motions of presiding over the table in her mothers absence but her mind was in a ferment over the dreadful news she had heard about Ashley and Melanie Desperately she longed for her mothers  Page    Gone With The Wind return from the Slatterys for without her she felt lost and alone What right had the Slatterys and their everlasting sickness to take Ellen away from home just at this time when she Scarlett needed her so much Throughout the dismal meal Geralds booming voice battered against her ears until she thought she could endure it no longer He had forgotten completely about his conversation with her that afternoon and was carrying on a monologue about the latest news from Fort Sumter which he punctuated by hammering his fist on the table and waving his arms in the air Gerald made a habit of dominating the conversation at mealtimes and usually Scarlett occupied with her own thoughts scarcely heard him but tonight she could not shut out his voice no matter how much she strained to listen for the sound of carriage wheels that would herald Ellens return Of course she did not intend to tell her mother what was so heavy on her heart for Ellen would be shocked and grieved to know that a daughter of hers wanted a man who was engaged to another girl But in the depths of the first tragedy she had ever known she wanted the very comfort of her mothers presence She always felt secure when Ellen was by her for there was nothing so bad that Ellen could not better it simply by being there She rose suddenly from her chair at the sound of creaking wheels in the driveway and then sank down again as they went on around the house to the back yard It could not be Ellen for she would alight at the front steps Then there was an excited babble of negro voices in the darkness of the yard and highpitched negro laughter Looking out the window Scarlett saw Pork who had left the room a moment before holding high a flaring pine knot while indistinguishable figures descended from a wagon The laughter and talking rose and fell in the dark night air pleasant homely carefree sounds gutturally soft musically shrill Then feet shuffled up the backporch stairs and into the passageway leading to the main house stopping in the hall just outside the dining room There was a brief interval of whispering and Pork entered his usual dignity gone his eyes rolling and his teeth agleam Mist Gerald he announced breathing hard the pride of a bridegroom all over his shining face you new oman done come New woman I didnt buy any new woman declared Gerald pretending to glare Yassah you did Mist Gerald Yassah An she out hyah now wanting ter speak wid you answered Pork giggling and twisting his hands in excitement Well bring in the bride said Gerald and Pork turning beckoned into the hall to his wife newly arrived from the Wilkes plantation to become part of the household of Tara She entered and behind her almost hidden by her voluminous calico skirts came her twelveyearold daughter squirming against her mothers legs Dilcey was tall and bore herself erectly She might have been any age from thirty to sixty so unlined was her immobile bronze face Indian blood was plain in her features overbalancing the negroid characteristics The red color of her skin narrow high forehead prominent cheek bones and the hawkbridged nose which flattened at the end above thick negro lips all showed the mixture of two races She was selfpossessed and walked with a dignity that surpassed even Mammys for Mammy had acquired her dignity and Dilceys was in her blood When she spoke her voice was not so slurred as most negroes and she chose her words more carefully Good evenin young Misses Mist Gerald I is sorry to sturb you but I wanted to come here and thank you agin fo buyin me and my chile Lots of gentlemens might a bought me but they wouldnt a bought my Prissy too jes to keep me frum grievin and I thanks you Im gwine do my bes fo you and show you I aint forgettin Humhurrump said Gerald clearing his throat in embarrassment at being caught openly in an act of kindness Dilcey turned to Scarlett and something like a smile wrinkled the corners of her eyes Miss Scarlett Poke done tole me how you ast Mist Gerald to buy me And so Im gwine give you my Prissy fo yo own maid She reached behind her and jerked the little girl forward She was a brown little creature with skinny legs like a bird and a myriad of pigtails carefully wrapped with twine sticking stiffly out from her head She had sharp knowing eyes that missed nothing and a studiedly stupid look on her face Thank you Dilcey Scarlett replied but Im afraid Mammy will have something to say about that Shes been my maid ever since I was born Mammy getting ole said Dilcey with a calmness that would have enraged Mammy She a good mammy but you a young lady now and needs a good maid and my Prissy been maidin fo Miss India fo a year now She kin sew and fix hair good as a grown pusson Prodded by her mother Prissy bobbed a sudden curtsy and grinned at Scarlett who could not help grinning back A sharp little wench she thought and said aloud Thank you Dilcey well see about it when Mother comes home Thankee Mam I gives you a good night said Dilcey and turning left the room with her child Pork dancing attendance The supper things cleared away Gerald resumed his oration but with little satisfaction to himself and none at all to his audience His thunderous predictions of immediate war and his rhetorical questions as to whether the South would stand for further insults from the Yankees only produced faintly bored Yes Papas and No Pas Carreen sitting on a hassock under the big lamp was deep in the romance of a girl who had taken the veil after her lovers death and with silent tears of enjoyment oozing from her eyes was pleasurably picturing herself in a white coif Suellen embroidering on what she gigglingly called her hope chest was wondering if she could possibly detach Stuart Tarleton from her sisters side at the barbecue tomorrow and fascinate him with the sweet womanly qualities which she possessed and Scarlett did not And Scarlett was in a tumult about Ashley How could Pa talk on and on about Fort Sumter and the Yankees when he knew her heart was breaking As usual in the very young she marveled that people could be so selfishly oblivious to her pain and the world rock along just the same in spite of her heartbreak Her mind was as if a cyclone had gone through it and it seemed strange that the dining room where they sat should be so placid so unchanged from what it had always been The heavy mahogany table and sideboards the massive silver the bright rag rugs on the shining floor were all in their accustomed places just as if nothing had happened It was a friendly and comfortable room and ordinarily Scarlett loved the quiet hours which the family spent there after supper but tonight she hated the sight of it and if she  Page    Gone With The Wind had not feared her fathers loudly bawled questions she would have slipped away down the dark hall to Ellens little office and cried out her sorrow on the old sofa That was the room that Scarlett liked the best in all the house There Ellen sat before her tall secretary each morning keeping the accounts of the plantation and listening to the reports of Jonas Wilkerson the overseer There also the family idled while Ellens quill scratched across her ledgers Gerald in the old rocker the girls on the sagging cushions of the sofa that was too battered and worn for the front of the house Scarlett longed to be there now alone with Ellen so she could put her head in her mothers lap and cry in peace Wouldnt Mother ever come home Then wheels ground sharply on the graveled driveway and the soft murmur of Ellens voice dismissing the coachman floated into the room The whole group looked up eagerly as she entered rapidly her hoops swaying her face tired and sad There entered with her the faint fragrance of lemon verbena sachet which seemed always to creep from the folds of her dresses a fragrance that was always linked in Scarletts mind with her mother Mammy followed at a few paces the leather bag in her hand her underlip pushed out and her brow lowering Mammy muttered darkly to herself as she waddled taking care that her remarks were pitched too low to be understood but loud enough to register her unqualified disapproval I am sorry I am so late said Ellen slipping her plaid shawl from drooping shoulders and handing it to Scarlett whose cheek she patted in passing Geralds face had brightened as if by magic at her entrance Is the brat baptized he questioned Yes and dead poor thing said Ellen I feared Emmie would die too but I think she will live The girls faces turned to her startled and questioning and Gerald wagged his head philosophically Well tis better so that the brat is dead no doubt poor fatherle It is late We had better have prayers now interrupted Ellen so smoothly that if Scarlett had not known her mother well the interruption would have passed unnoticed It would be interesting to know who was the father of Emmie Slatterys baby but Scarlett knew she would never learn the truth of the matter if she waited to hear it from her mother Scarlett suspected Jonas Wilkerson for she had frequently seen him walking down the road with Emmie at nightfall Jonas was a Yankee and a bachelor and the fact that he was an overseer forever barred him from any contact with the County social life There was no family of any standing into which he could marry no peo ple with whom he could associate except the Slatterys and riffraff like them As he was several cuts above the Slatterys in education it was only natural that he should not want to marry Emmie no matter how often he might walk with her in the twilight Scarlett sighed for her curiosity was sharp Things were always happening under her mothers eyes which she noticed no more than if they had not happened at all Ellen ignored all things contrary to her ideas of propriety and tried to teach Scarlett to do the same but with poor success Ellen had stepped to the mantel to take her rosary beads from the small inlaid casket in which they always reposed when Mammy spoke up with firmness Miss Ellen you gwine eat some supper befo you does any prayin Thank you Mammy but I am not hungry Ah gwine fix yo supper mahseff an you eats it said Mammy her brow furrowed with indignation as she started down the hall for the kitchen Poke she called tell Cookie stir up de fiah Miss Ellen home As the boards shuddered under her weight the soliloquy she had been muttering in the front hall grew louder and louder coming clearly to the ears of the family in the dining room Ah has said time an again it doan do no good doin nuthin fer wite trash Dey is de shiflesses mos ungrateful passel of nocounts livin An Miss Ellen got no bizness weahin herseff out waitin on folks dat did dey be wuth shootin deyd have niggers ter wait on dem An Ah has said Her voice trailed off as she went down the long open passageway covered only by a roof that led into the kitchen Mammy had her own method of letting her owners know exactly where she stood on all matters She knew it was beneath the dignity of quality white folks to pay the slightest attention to what a darky said when she was just grumbling to herself She knew that to uphold this dignity they must ignore what she said even if she stood in the next room and almost shouted It protected her from reproof and it left no doubt in anyones mind as to her exact views on any subject Pork entered the room bearing a plate silver and a napkin He was followed closely by Jack a black little boy of ten hastily buttoning a white linen jacket with one hand and bearing in the other a flyswisher made of thin strips of newspaper tied to a reed longer than he was Ellen had a beautiful peacockfeather flybrusher but it was used only on very special occasions and then only after domestic struggle due to the obstinate conviction of Pork Cookie and Mammy that peacock feathers were bad luck Ellen sat down in the chair which Gerald pulled out for her and four voices attacked her Mother the lace is loose on my new ball dress and I want to wear it tomorrow night at Twelve Oaks Wont you please fix it Mother Scarletts new dress is prettier than mine and I look like a fright in pink Why cant she wear my pink and let me wear her green She looks all right in pink Mother can I stay up for the ball tomorrow night Im thirteen now Mrs OHara would you believe it Hush you girls before I take me crop to you Cade Calvert was in Atlanta this morning and he sayswill you be quiet and let me be hearing me own voiceand he says its all upset they are there and talking nothing but war militia drilling troops forming And he says the news from Charleston is that they will be putting up with no more Yankee insults Ellens tired mouth smiled into the tumult as she addressed herself first to her husband as a wife should If the nice people of Charleston feel that way Im sure we will all feel the same way soon she said for she had a deeply rooted belief that excepting only Savannah most of the gentle blood of the whole continent could be found in that small seaport city a belief shared largely by Charlestonians  Page    Gone With The Wind No Carreen next year dear Then you can stay up for balls and wear grownup dresses and what a good time my little pink cheeks will have Dont pout dear You can go to the barbecue remember that and stay up through supper but no balls until you are fourteen Give me your gown Scarlett I will whip the lace for you after prayers Suellen I do not like your tone dear Your pink gown is lovely and suitable to your complexion Scarletts is to hers But you may wear my garnet necklace tomorrow night Suellen behind her mothers back wrinkled her nose triumphantly at Scarlett who had been planning to beg the necklace for herself Scarlett put out her tongue at her Suellen was an annoying sister with her whining and selfishness and had it not been for Ellens restraining hand Scarlett would frequently have boxed her ears Now Mr OHara tell me more about what Mr Calvert said about Charleston said Ellen Scarlett knew her mother cared nothing at all about war and politics and thought them masculine matters about which no lady could intelligently concern herself But it gave Gerald pleasure to air his views and Ellen was unfailingly thoughtful of her husbands pleasure While Gerald launched forth on his news Mammy set the plates before her mistress goldentopped biscuits breast of fried chicken and a yellow yam open and steaming with melted butter dripping from it Mammy pinched small Jack and he hastened to his business of slowly swishing the paper ribbons back and forth behind Ellen Mammy stood beside the table watching every forkful that traveled from plate to mouth as though she intended to force the food down Ellens throat should she see signs of flagging Ellen ate diligently but Scarlett could see that she was too tired to know what she was eating Only Mammys implacable face forced her to it When the dish was empty and Gerald only midway in his remarks on the thievishness of Yankees who wanted to free darkies and yet offered no penny to pay for their freedom Ellen rose Well be having prayers he questioned reluctantly Yes It is so latewhy it is actually ten oclock as the clock with coughing and tinny thumps marked the hour Carreen should have been asleep long ago The lamp please Pork and my prayer book Mammy Prompted by Mammys hoarse whisper Jack set his flybrush in the corner and removed the dishes while Mammy fumbled in the sideboard drawer for Ellens worn prayer book Pork tiptoeing reached the ring in the chain and drew the lamp slowly down until the table top was brightly bathed in light and the ceiling receded into shadows Ellen arranged her skirts and sank to the floor on her knees laying the open prayer book on the table before her and clasping her hands upon it Gerald knelt beside her and Scarlett and Suellen took their accustomed places on the opposite side of the table folding their voluminous petticoats in pads under their knees so they would ache less from contact with the hard floor Carreen who was small for her age could not kneel comfortably at the table and so knelt facing a chair her elbows on the seat She liked this position for she seldom failed to go to sleep during prayers and in this posture it escaped her mothers notice The house servants shuffled and rustled in the hall to kneel by the doorway Mammy groaning aloud as she sank down Pork straight as a ramrod Rosa and Teena the maids graceful in their spreading bright calicoes Cookie gaunt and yellow beneath her snowy head rag and Jack stupid with sleep as far away from Mammys pinching fingers as possible Their dark eyes gleamed expectantly for praying with their white folks was one of the events of the day The old and colorful phrases of the litany with its Oriental imagery meant little to them but it satisfied something in their hearts and they always swayed when they chanted the responses Lord have mercy on us Christ have mercy on us Ellen closed her eyes and began praying her voice rising and falling lulling and soothing Heads bowed in the circle of yellow light as Ellen thanked God for the health and happiness of her home her family and her negroes When she had finished her prayers for those beneath the roof of Tara her father mother sisters three dead babies and all the poor souls in Purgatory she clasped her white beads between long fingers and began the Rosary like the rushing of a soft wind the responses from black throats and white throats rolled back Holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death Despite her heartache and the pain of unshed tears a deep sense of quiet and peace fell upon Scarlett as it always did at this hour Some of the disappointment of the day and the dread of the morrow departed from her leaving a feeling of hope It was not the lifting up of her heart to God that brought this balm for religion went no more than lip deep with her It was the sight of her mothers serene face upturned to the throne of God and His saints and angels praying for blessings on those whom she loved When Ellen intervened with Heaven Scarlett felt certain that Heaven heard Ellen finished and Gerald who could never find his beads at prayer time began furtively counting his decade on his fingers As his voice droned on Scarletts thoughts strayed in spite of herself She knew she should be examining her conscience Ellen had taught her that at the end of each day it was her duty to examine her conscience thoroughly to admit her numerous faults and pray to God for forgiveness and strength never to repeat them But Scarlett was examining her heart She dropped her head upon her folded hands so that her mother could not see her face and her thoughts went sadly back to Ashley How could he be planning to marry Melanie when he really loved her Scarlett And when he knew how much she loved him How could he deliberately break her heart Then suddenly an idea shining and new flashed like a comet through her brain Why Ashley hasnt an idea that Im in love with him She almost gasped aloud in the shock of its unexpectedness Her mind stood still as if paralyzed for a long breathless instant and then raced forward How could he know Ive always acted so prissy and ladylike and touchmenot around him he probably thinks I dont care a thing about him except as a friend Yes thats why hes never spoken He thinks his love is hopeless And thats why hes looked so Her mind went swiftly back to those times when she had caught him looking at her in that strange manner when the gray eyes that were such perfect curtains for his thoughts had been wide and naked and had in them a look of torment and despair  Page    Gone With The Wind Hes been broken hearted because he thinks Im in love with Brent or Stuart or Cade And probably he thinks that if he cant have me he might as well please his family and marry Melanie But if he knew I did love him Her volatile spirits shot up from deepest depression to excited happiness This was the answer to Ashleys reticence to his strange conduct He didnt know Her vanity leaped to the aid of her desire to believe making belief a certainty If he knew she loved him he would hasten to her side She had only to Oh she thought rapturously digging her fingers into her lowered brow What a fool Ive been not to think of this till now I must think of some way to let him know He wouldnt marry her if he knew I loved him How could he With a start she realized that Gerald had finished and her mothers eyes were on her Hastily she began her decade telling off the beads automatically but with a depth of emotion in her voice that caused Mammy to open her eyes and shoot a searching glance at her As she finished her prayers and Suellen then Carreen began their decades her mind was still speeding onward with her entrancing new thought Even now it wasnt too late Too often the County had been scandalized by elopements when one or the other of the participating parties was practically at the altar with a third And Ashleys engagement had not even been announced yet Yes there was plenty of time If no love lay between Ashley and Melanie but only a promise given long ago then why wasnt it possible for him to break that promise and marry her Surely he would do it if he knew that she Scarlett loved him She must find some way to let him know She would find some way And then Scarlett came abruptly out of her dream of delight for she had neglected to make the responses and her mother was looking at her reprovingly As she resumed the ritual she opened her eyes briefly and cast a quick glance around the room The kneeling figures the soft glow of the lamp the dim shadows where the negroes swayed even the familiar objects that had been so hateful to her sight an hour ago in an instant took on the color of her own emotions and the room seemed once more a lovely place She would never forget this moment or this scene Virgin most faithful her mother intoned The Litany of the Virgin was beginning and obediently Scarlett responded Pray for us as Ellen praised in soft contralto the attributes of the Mother of God As always since childhood this was for Scarlett a moment for adoration of Ellen rather than the Virgin Sacrilegious though it might be Scarlett always saw through her closed eyes the upturned face of Ellen and not the Blessed Virgin as the ancient phrases were repeated Health of the Sick Seat of Wisdom Refuge of Sinners Mystical Rosethey were beautiful because they were the attributes of Ellen But tonight became of the exaltation of her own spirit Scarlett found in the whole ceremonial the softly spoken words the murmur of the responses a surpassing beauty beyond any that she had ever experienced before And her heart went up to God in sincere thankfulness that a pathway for her feet had been openedout of her misery and straight to the arms of Ashley When the last Amen sounded they all rose somewhat stiffly Mammy being hauled to her feet by the combined efforts of Teena and Rosa Pork took a long spiller from the mantelpiece lit it from the lamp flame and went into the hall Opposite the winding stair stood a walnut sideboard too large for use in the dining room bearing on its wide top several lamps and a long row of candles in candlesticks Pork lit one lamp and three candles and with the pompous dignity of a first chamberlain of the royal bedchamber lighting a king and queen to their rooms he led the procession up the stairs holding the light high above his head Ellen on Geralds arm followed him and the girls each taking her own candlestick mounted after them Scarlett entered her room set the candle on the tall chest of drawers and fumbled in the dark closet for the dancing dress that needed stitching Throwing it across her arm she crossed the hall quietly The door of her parents bedroom was slightly ajar and before she could knock Ellens voice low but stern came to her ears Mr OHara you must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson Gerald exploded And where will I be getting another overseer who wouldnt be cheating me out of my eyeteeth He must be dismissed immediately tomorrow morning Big Sam is a good foreman and he can take over the duties until you can hire another overseer Ah ha came Geralds voice So I understand Then the worthy Jonas sired the He must be dismissed So he is the father of Emmie Slatterys baby thought Scarlett Oh well What else can you expect from a Yankee man and a whitetrash girl Then after a discreet pause which gave Geralds splutterings time to die away she knocked on the door and handed the dress to her mother By the time Scarlett had undressed and blown out the candle her plan for tomorrow had worked itself out in every detail It was a simple plan for with Geralds singlemindedness of purpose her eyes were centered on the goal and she thought only of the most direct steps by which to reach it First she would be prideful as Gerald had commanded From the moment she arrived at Twelve Oaks she would be her gayest most spirited self No one would suspect that she had ever been downhearted because of Ashley and Melanie And she would flirt with every man there That would be cruel to Ashley but it would make him yearn for her all the more She wouldnt overlook a man of marriageable age from gingerwhiskered old Frank Kennedy who was Suellens beau on down to shy quiet blushing Charles Hamilton Melanies brother They would swarm around her like bees around a hive and certainly Ashley would be drawn from Melanie to join the circle of her admirers Then somehow she would maneuver to get a few minutes alone with him away from the crowd She hoped everything would work out that way because it would be more difficult otherwise But if Ashley didnt make the first move she would simply have to do it herself When they were finally alone he would have fresh in his mind the picture of the other men thronging about her he would be newly impressed with the fact that every one of them wanted her and that look of sadness and despair would be in his eyes Then she would make him happy again by letting him discover that popular though she was she preferred him above any other man in all the world And when she admitted it modestly and sweetly she would look a thousand things more Of course she would do  Page    Gone With The Wind it all in a ladylike way She wouldnt even dream of saying to him boldly that she loved himthat would never do But the manner of telling him was a detail that troubled her not at all She had managed such situations before and she could do it again Lying in the bed with the moonlight streaming dimly over her she pictured the whole scene in her mind She saw the look of surprise and happiness that would come over his face when he realized that she really loved him and she heard the words he would say asking her to be his wife Naturally she would have to say then that she simply couldnt think of marrying a man when he was engaged to another girl but he would insist and finally she would let herself be persuaded Then they would decide to run off to Jonesboro that very afternoon and Why by this time tomorrow night she might be Mrs Ashley Wilkes She sat up in bed hugging her knees and for a long happy moment she was Mrs Ashley WilkesAshleys bride Then a slight chill entered her heart Suppose it didnt work out this way Suppose Ashley didnt beg her to run away with him Resolutely she pushed the thought from her mind I wont think of that now she said firmly If I think of it now it will upset me Theres no reason why things wont come out the way I want themif he loves me And I know he does She raised her chin and her pale blackfringed eyes sparkled in the moonlight Ellen had never told her that desire and attainment were two different matters life had not taught her that the race was not to the swift She lay in the silvery shadows with courage rising and made the plans that a sixteenyearold makes when life has been so pleasant that defeat is an impossibility and a pretty dress and a clear complexion are weapons to vanquish fate CHAPTER V IT WAS TEN OCLOCK in the morning The day was warm for April and the golden sunlight streamed brilliantly into Scarletts room through the blue curtains of the wide windows The creamcolored walls glowed with light and the depths of the mahogany furniture gleamed deep red like wine while the floor glistened as if it were glass except where the rag rugs covered it and they were spots of gay color Already summer was in the air the first hint of Georgia summer when the high tide of spring gives way reluctantly before a fiercer heat A balmy soft warmth poured into the room heavy with velvety smells redolent of many blossoms of newly fledged trees and of the moist freshly turned red earth Through the window Scarlett could see the bright riot of the twin lanes of daffodils bordering the graveled driveway and the golden masses of yellow jessamine spreading flowery sprangles modestly to the earth like crinolines The mockingbirds and the jays engaged in their old feud for possession of the magnolia tree beneath her window were bickering the jays strident acrimonious the mockers sweet voiced and plaintive Such a glowing morning usually called Scarlett to the window to lean arms on the broad sill and drink in the scents and sounds of Tara But today she had no eye for sun or azure sky beyond a hasty thought Thank God it isnt raining On the bed lay the applegreen wateredsilk ball dress with its festoons of ecru lace neatly packed in a large cardboard box It was ready to be carried to Twelve Oaks to be donned before the dancing began but Scarlett shrugged at the sight of it If her plans were successful she would not wear that dress tonight Long before the ball began she and Ashley would be on their way to Jonesboro to be married The troublesome question waswhat dress should she wear to the barbecue What dress would best set off her charms and make her most irresistible to Ashley Since eight oclock she had been trying on and rejecting dresses and now she stood dejected and irritable in lace pantalets linen corset cover and three billowing lace and linen petticoats Discarded garments lay about her on the floor the bed the chairs in bright heaps of color and straying ribbons The rose organdie with long pink sash was becoming but she had worn it last summer when Melanie visited Twelve Oaks and shed be sure to remember it And might be catty enough to mention it The black bombazine with its puffed sleeves and princess lace collar set off her white skin superbly but it did make her look a trifle elderly Scarlett peered anxiously in the mirror at her sixteenyearold face as if expecting to see wrinkles and sagging chin muscles It would never do to appear sedate and elderly before Melanies sweet youthfulness The lavender barred muslin was beautiful with those wide insets of lace and net about the hem but it had never suited her type It would suit Carreens delicate profile and wishywashy expression perfectly but Scarlett felt that it made her look like a schoolgirl It would never do to appear schoolgirlish beside Melanies poised self The green plaid taffeta frothing with flounces and each flounce edged in green velvet ribbon was most becoming in fact her favorite dress for it darkened her eyes to emerald But there was unmistakably a grease spot on the front of the basque Of course her brooch could be pinned over the spot but perhaps Melanie had sharp eyes There remained varicolored cotton dresses which Scarlett felt were not festive enough for the occasion ball dresses and the green sprigged muslin she had worn yesterday But it was an afternoon dress It was not suitable for a barbecue for it had only tiny puffed sleeves and the neck was low enough for a dancing dress But there was nothing else to do but wear it After all she was not ashamed of her neck and arms and bosom even if it was not correct to show them in the morning As she stood before the mirror and twisted herself about to get a side view she thought that there was absolutely nothing about her figure to cause her shame Her neck was short but rounded and her arms plump and enticing Her breasts pushed high by her stays were very nice breasts She had never had to sew tiny rows of silk ruffles in the lining of her basques as most sixteenyearold girls did to give their figures the desired curves and fullness She was glad she had inherited Ellens slender white hands and tiny feet and she wished she had Ellens height too but her own height pleased her very well What a pity legs could not be shown she thought pulling up her petticoats and regretfully viewing them plump and neat under pantalets She had such nice legs Even the girls at the Fayetteville Academy had admitted as much And as for her waistthere was no one in Fayetteville Jonesboro or in three counties for that matter who had so small a waist The thought of her waist brought her back to practical matters The green muslin measured seventeen inches about the waist and Mammy had laced her for the eighteeninch bombazine Mammy would have to lace her tighter She pushed open the door listened and heard Mammys heavy tread in the downstairs hall She shouted for her impatiently knowing she could raise her  Page    Gone With The Wind voice with impunity as Ellen was in the smokehouse measuring out the days food to Cookie Some folks thinks as how Ah kin fly grumbled Mammy shuffling up the stairs She entered puffing with the expression of one who expects battle and welcomes it In her large black hands was a tray upon which food smoked two large yams covered with butter a pile of buckwheat cakes dripping syrup and a large slice of ham swimming in gravy Catching sight of Mammys burden Scarletts expression changed from one of minor irritation to obstinate belligerency In the excitement of trying on dresses she had forgotten Mammys ironclad rule that before going to any party the OHara girls must be crammed so full of food at home they would be unable to eat any refreshments at the party Its no use I wont eat it You can just take it back to the kitchen Mammy set the tray on the table and squared herself hands on hips Yasm you is Ah ain figgerin on havin happen whut happen at dat las barbecue wen Ah wuz too sick frum dem chittlins Ah et ter fetch you no tray befo you went You is gwine eat evey bite of dis I am not Now come here and lace me tighter because we are late already I heard the carriage come round to the front of the house Mammys tone became wheedling Now Miss Scarlett you be good an come eat jesa lil Miss Carreen an Miss Suellen done eat all deyn They would said Scarlett contemptuously They havent any more spirit than a rabbit But I wont Im through with trays Im not forgetting the time I ate a whole tray and went to the Calverts and they had ice cream out of ice theyd brought all the way from Savannah and I couldnt eat but a spoonful Im going to have a good time today and eat as much as I please At this defiant heresy Mammys brow lowered with indignation What a young miss could do and what she could not do were as different as black and white in Mammys mind there was no middle ground of deportment between Suellen and Carreen were clay in her powerful hands and harkened respectfully to her warning But it had always been a struggle to teach Scarlett that most of her natural impulses were unladylike Mammys victories over Scarlett were hardwon and represented guile unknown to the white mind Ef you doan care bout how folks talks bout dis fambly Ah does she rumbled Ah ain gwine stand by an have eveybody at de pahty sayin how you ain fotched up right Ah has tole you an tole you dat you kin allus tell a lady by dat she eat lak a bird An Ah ain aimin ter have you go ter Mist Wilkes an eat lak a feel han an gobble lak a hawg Mother is a lady and she eats countered Scarlett Wen you is mahied you kin eat too retorted Mammy Wen Miss Ellen yo age she never et nuthin wen she went out an needer yo Aunt Pauline nor yo Aunt Eulalie An dey all done mahied Young misses whut eats heavy mos generly doan never ketch husbands I dont believe it At that barbecue when you were sick and I didnt eat beforehand Ashley Wilkes told me he liked to see a girl with a healthy appetite Mammy shook her head ominously Whut gempmums says an whut dey thinks is two diffunt things An Ah ain noticed Mist Ashley axing fer ter mahy you Scarlett scowled started to speak sharply and then caught herself Mammy had her there and there was no argument Seeing the obdurate look on Scarletts face Mammy picked up the tray and with the bland guile of her race changed her tactics As she started for the door she sighed Wellm awright Ah wuz tellin Cookie wile she wuz afixin dis tray You kin sho tell a lady by whut she doan eat an Ah say ter Cookie Ah ain seed no wite lady who et lessn Miss Melly Hamilton did las time she wuz visitin Mist AshleyAh means visitin Miss India Scarlett shot a look of sharp suspicion at her but Mammys broad face carried only a look of innocence and of regret that Scarlett was not the lady Melanie Hamilton was Put down that tray and come lace me tighter said Scarlett irritably And Ill try to eat a little afterwards If I ate now I couldnt lace tight enough Cloaking her triumph Mammy set down the tray Whut mah lamb gwine wear That answered Scarlett pointing at the fluffy mass of green flowered muslin Instantly Mammy was in arms No you ain It ain fittin fer mawnin You kain show yo buzzum befo three oclock an dat dress ain got no neck an no sleeves An youll git freckled sho as you born an Ah ain figgerin on you gittin freckled affer all de buttermilk Ah been puttin on you all dis winter bleachin dem freckles you got at Savannah settin on de beach Ah sho gwine speak ter yo Ma bout you If you say one word to her before Im dressed I wont eat a bite said Scarlett coolly Mother wont have time to send me back to change once Im dressed Mammy sighed resignedly beholding herself outguessed Between the two evils it was better to have Scarlett wear an afternoon dress at a morning barbecue than to have her gobble like a hog Hole onter sumpin an suck in yo breaf she commanded Scarlett obeyed bracing herself and catching firm hold of one of the bedposts Mammy pulled and jerked vigorously and as the tiny circumference of whalebonegirdled waist grew smaller a proud fond look came into her eyes Ain nobody got a wais lak mah lamb she said approvingly Evey time Ah pulls Miss Suellen littler dan twenty inches she up an faint Pooh gasped Scarlett speaking with difficulty I never fainted in my life Well twouldn do no hahm ef you wuz ter faint now an den advised Mammy You is so brash sometimes Miss Scarlett Ah been aimin ter tell you it jes doan look good de way you doan faint bout snakes an mouses an sech Ah doan mean round home but wen you is out in compny An Ah has tole you an Oh hurry Dont talk so much Ill catch a husband See if I dont even if I dont scream and faint Goodness but my stays are  Page    Gone With The Wind tight Put on the dress Mammy carefully dropped the twelve yards of green sprigged muslin over the mountainous petticoats and hooked up the back of the tight lowcut basque You keep yo shawl on yo shoulders wen you is in de sun an doan you go takin off yo hat wen you is wahm she commanded Elsewise you be comin home lookin brown lak Ole Miz Slattery Now you come eat honey but doan eat too fas No use havin it come right back up agin Scarlett obediently sat down before the tray wondering if she would be able to get any food into her stomach and still have room to breathe Mammy plucked a large towel from the washstand and carefully tied it around Scarletts neck spreading the white folds over her lap Scarlett began on the ham because she liked ham and forced it down I wish to Heaven I was married she said resentfully as she attacked the yams with loathing Tin tired of everlastingly being unnatural and never doing anything I want to do Im tired of acting like I dont eat more than a bird and walking when I want to run and saying I feel faint after a waltz when I could dance for two days and never get tired Im tired of saying How wonderful you are to fool men who havent got onehalf the sense Ive got and Im tired of pretending I dont know anything so men can tell me things and feel important while theyre doing it  I cant eat another bite Try a hot cake said Mammy inexorably Why is it a girl has to be so silly to catch a husband Ah specs its kase gempmums doan know whut dey wants Dey jes knows whut dey thinks dey wants An givin dem whut dey thinks dey wants saves a pile of mizry an bein a ole maid An dey thinks dey wants mousy lil gals wid birds tastes an no sense at all It doan make a gempmum feel lak mahyin a lady ef he suspicions she got mo sense dan he has Dont you suppose men get surprised after theyre married to find that their wives do have sense Well its too late den Deys already mahied Sides gempmums specs dey wives ter have sense Some day Im going to do and say everything I want to do and say and if people dont like it I dont care No you ain said Mammy grimly Not while Ah got breaf You eat dem cakes Sop dem in de gravy honey I dont think Yankee girls have to act like such fools When we were at Saratoga last year I noticed plenty of them acting like they had right good sense and in front of men too Mammy snorted Yankee gals Yasm Ah guess dey speaks dey minds awright but Ah ain noticed many of dem gittin proposed ter at Saratoga But Yankees must get married argued Scarlett They dont just grow They must get married and have children Theres too many of them Men mahys dem fer dey money said Mammy firmly Scarlett sopped the wheat cake in the gravy and put it in her mouth Perhaps there was something to what Mammy said There must be something in it for Ellen said the same things in different and more delicate words In fact the mothers of all her girl friends impressed on their daughters the necessity of being helpless clinging doeeyed creatures Really it took a lot of sense to cultivate and hold such a pose Perhaps she had been too brash Occasionally she had argued with Ashley and frankly aired her opinions Perhaps this and her healthy enjoyment of walking and riding had turned him from her to the frail Melanie Perhaps if she changed her tactics But she felt that if Ashley succumbed to premeditated feminine tricks she could never respect him as she now did Any man who was fool enough to fall for a simper a faint and an Oh how wonderful you are wasnt worth having But they all seemed to like it If she had used the wrong tactics with Ashley in the pastwell that was the past and done with Today she would use different ones the right ones She wanted him and she had only a few hours in which to get him If fainting or pretending to faint would do the trick then she would faint If simpering coquetry or emptyheadedness would attract him she would gladly play the flirt and be more emptyheaded than even Cathleen Calvert And if bolder measures were necessary she would take them Today was the day There was no one to tell Scarlett that her own personality frighteningly vital though it was was more attractive than any masquerade she might adopt Had she been told she would have been pleased but unbelieving And the civilization of which she was a part would have been unbelieving too for at no time before or since had so low a premium been placed on feminine naturalness As the carriage bore her down the red road toward the Wilkes plantation Scarlett had a feeling of guilty pleasure that neither her mother nor Mammy was with the party There would be no one at the barbecue who by delicately lifted brows or outthrust underlip could interfere with her plan of action Of course Suellen would be certain to tell tales tomorrow but if an went as Scarlett hoped the excitement of the family over her engagement to Ashley or her elopement would more than overbalance their displeasure Yes she was very glad Ellen had been forced to stay at home Gerald primed with brandy had given Jonas Wilkerson his dismissal that morning and Ellen had remained at Tara to go over the accounts of the plantation before he took his departure Scarlett had kissed her mother goodby in the little office where she sat before the tall secretary with its paperstuffed pigeonholes Jonas Wilkerson hat in hand stood beside her his sallow tightskinned face hardly concealing the fury of hate that possessed him at being so unceremoniously turned out of the best overseers job in the County And all because of a bit of minor philandering He had told Gerald over and over that Emmie Slatterys baby might have been fathered by any one of a dozen men as easily as himselfan idea in which Gerald concurredbut that had not altered his case so far as Ellen was concerned Jonas hated all Southerners He hated their cool courtesy to him and their contempt for his social status so inadequately covered by their courtesy He hated Ellen OHara above anyone else for she was the epitome of all that he hated in Southerners Mammy as head woman of the plantation had remained to help Ellen and it was Dilcey who rode on the drivers seat beside Toby the girls dancing dresses in a long box across her lap Gerald rode beside the carriage on his big hunter warm with brandy  Page    Gone With The Wind and pleased with himself for having gotten through with the unpleasant business of Wilkerson so speedily He had shoved the responsibility onto Ellen and her disappointment at missing the barbecue and the gathering of her friends did not enter his mind for it was a fine spring day and his fields were beautiful and the birds were singing and he felt too young and frolicsome to think of anyone else Occasionally he burst out with Peg in a Lowbacked Car and other Irish ditties or the more lugubrious lament for Robert Emmet She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps He was happy pleasantly excited over the prospect of spending the day shouting about the Yankees and the war and proud of his three pretty daughters in their bright spreading hoop skirts beneath foolish little lace parasols He gave no thought to his conversation of the day before with Scarlett for it had completely slipped his mind He only thought that she was pretty and a great credit to him and that today her eyes were as green as the hills of Ireland The last thought made him think better of himself for it had a certain poetic ring to it and so he favored the girls with a loud and slightly offkey rendition of The Wearin o the Green Scarlett looking at him with the affectionate contempt that mothers feel for small swaggering sons knew that he would be very drunk by sundown Coming home in the dark he would try as usual to jump every fence between Twelve Oaks and Tara and she hoped by the mercy of Providence and the good sense of his horse would escape breaking his neck He would disdain the bridge and swim his horse through the river and come home roaring to be put to bed on the sofa in the office by Pork who always waited up with a lamp in the front hall on such occasions He would ruin his new gray broadcloth suit which would cause him to swear horribly in the morning and tell Ellen at great length how his horse fell off the bridge in the darknessa palpable lie which would fool no one but which would be accepted by all and make him feel very clever Pa is a sweet selfish irresponsible darling Scarlett thought with a surge of affection for him She felt so excited and happy this morning that she included the whole world as well as Gerald in her affection She was pretty and she knew it she would have Ashley for her own before the day was over the sun was warm and tender and the glory of the Georgia spring was spread before her eyes Along the roadside the blackberry brambles were concealing with softest green the savage red gulches cut by the winters rains and the bare granite boulders pushing up through the red earth were being draped with sprangles of Cherokee roses and compassed about by wild violets of palest purple hue Upon the wooded hills above the river the dogwood blossoms lay glistening and white as if snow still lingered among the greenery The flowering crab trees were bursting their buds and rioting from delicate white to deepest pink and beneath the trees where the sunshine dappled the pine straw the wild honeysuckle made a varicolored carpet of scarlet and orange and rose There was a faint wild fragrance of sweet shrub on the breeze and the world smelted good enough to eat Ill remember how beautiful this day is till I die thought Scarlett Perhaps it will be my wedding day And she thought with a tingling in her heart how she and Ashley might ride swiftly through this beauty of blossom and greenery this very afternoon or tonight by moonlight toward Jonesboro and a preacher Of course she would have to be remarried by a priest from Atlanta but that would be something for Ellen and Gerald to worry about She quailed a little as she thought how white with mortification Ellen would be at hearing that her daughter had eloped with another girls fianc but she knew Ellen would forgive her when she saw her happiness And Gerald would scold and bawl but for all his remarks of yesterday about not wanting her to marry Ashley he would be pleased beyond words at an alliance between his family and the Wilkes But thatll be something to worry about after Im married she thought tossing the worry from her It was impossible to feel anything but palpitating joy in this warm sun in this spring with the chimneys of Twelve Oaks just beginning to show on the hill across the river Ill live there all my life and Ill see fifty springs like this and maybe more and Ill tell my children and my grandchildren how beautiful this spring was lovelier than any theyll ever see She was so happy at this thought that she joined in the last chorus of The Wearin o the Green and won Geralds shouted approval I dont know why youre so happy this morning said Suellen crossly for the thought still rankled in her mind that she would look far better in Scarletts green silk dancing frock than its rightful owner would And why was Scarlett always so selfish about lending her clothes and bonnets And why did Mother always back her up declaring green was not Suellens color You know as well as I do that Ashleys engagement is going to be announced tonight Pa said so this morning And I know youve been sweet on him for months Thats all you know said Scarlett putting out her tongue and refusing to lose her good humor How surprised Miss Sue would be by this time tomorrow morning Susie you know thats not so protested Carreen shocked Its Brent that Scarlett cares about Scarlett turned smiling green eyes upon her younger sister wondering how anyone could be so sweet The whole family knew that Carreens thirteenyearold heart was set upon Brent Tarleton who never gave her a thought except as Scarletts baby sister When Ellen was not present the OHaras teased her to tears about him Darling I dont care a thing about Brent declared Scarlett happy enough to be generous And he doesnt care a thing about me Why hes waiting for you to grow up Carreens round little face became pink as pleasure struggled with incredulity Oh Scarlett really Scarlett you know Mother said Carreen was too young to think about beaux yet and there you go putting ideas in her head Well go and tattle and see if I care replied Scarlett You want to hold Sissy back because you know shes going to be prettier than you in a year or so Youll be keeping civil tongues in your heads this day or Ill be taking me crop to you warned Gerald Now whist Is it wheels Im hearing Thatll be the Tarletons or the Fontaines As they neared the intersecting road that came down the thickly wooded hill from Mimosa and Fairhill the sound of hooves and carriage wheels became plainer and clamorous feminine voices raised in pleasant dispute sounded from behind the screen of  Page    Gone With The Wind trees Gerald riding ahead pulled up his hone and signed to Toby to stop the carriage where the two roads met  Tis the Tarleton ladies he announced to his daughters his florid face abeam for excepting Ellen there was no lady in the County he liked more than the redhaired Mrs Tarleton And tis herself at the reins Ah theres a woman with fine hands for a horse Feather light and strong as rawhide and pretty enough to kiss for all that Mores the pity none of you have such hands he added casting fond but reproving glances at his girls With Carreen afraid of the poor beasts and Sue with hands tike sadirons when it comes to reins and you Puss Well at any rate Ive never been thrown cried Scarlett indignantly And Mrs Tarleton takes a toss at every hunt And breaks a collar bone like a man said Gerald No fainting no fussing Now no more of it for here she comes He stood up in his stirrups and took off his hat with a sweep as the Tarleton carriage overflowing with girls in bright dresses and parasols and fluttering veils came into view with Mrs Tarleton on the box as Gerald had said With her four daughters their mammy and their ball dresses in long cardboard boxes crowding the carriage there was no room for the coachman And besides Beatrice Tarleton never willingly permitted anyone black or white to hold reins when her arms were out of slings Frail fineboned so white of skin that her flaming hair seemed to have drawn all the color from her face into its vital burnished mass she was nevertheless possessed of exuberant health and untiring energy She had borne eight children as red of hair and as full of life as she and had raised them most successfully so the County said because she gave them all the loving neglect and the stem discipline she gave the colts she bred Curb them but dont break their spirits was Mrs Tarletons motto She loved horses and talked horses constantly She understood them and handled them better than any man in the County Colts overflowed the paddock onto the front lawn even as her eight children overflowed the rambling house on the hill and colts and sons and daughters and hunting dogs tagged after her as she went about the plantation She credited her horses especially her red mare Nellie with human intelligence and if the cares of the house kept her busy beyond the time when she expected to take her daily ride she put the sugar bowl in the hands of some small pickaninny and said Give Nellie a handful and tell her Ill be out terrectly Except on rare occasions she always wore her riding habit for whether she rode or not she always expected to ride and in that expectation put on her habit upon arising Each morning rain or shine Nellie was saddled and walked up and down in front of the house waiting for the time when Mrs Tarleton could spare an hour away from her duties But Fairhill was a difficult plantation to manage and spare time hard to get and more often than not Nellie walked up and down riderless hour after hour while Beatrice Tarleton went through the day with the skirt of her habit absently looped over her arm and six inches of shining boot showing below it Today dressed in dull black silk over unfashionably narrow hoops she still looked as though in her habit for the dress was as severely tailored as her riding costume and the small black hat with Ha long black plume perched over one warm twinkling brown eye was a replica of the battered old hat she used for hunting She waved her whip when she saw Gerald and drew her dancing pair of red horses to a halt and the four girls in the back of the carriage leaned out and gave such vociferous cries of greeting that the team pranced in alarm To a casual observer it would seem that years had passed since the Tarletons had seen the OHaras instead of only two days But they were a sociable family and liked their neighbors especially the OHara girls That is they liked Suellen and Carreen No girl in the County with the possible exception of the emptyheaded Cathleen Calvert really liked Scarlett In summers the County averaged a barbecue and ball nearly every week but to the redhaired Tarletons with their enormous capacity for enjoying themselves each barbecue and each ball was as exciting as if it were the fast they had ever attended They were a pretty buxom quartette so crammed into the carriage that their hoops and flounces overlapped and their parasols nudged and bumped together above their wide leghorn sun hats crowned with roses and dangling with black velvet chin ribbons All shades of red hair were represented beneath these hats Hettys plain red hair Camillas strawberry blonde Randas coppery auburn and small Betsys carrot top Thats a fine bevy Mam said Gerald gallantly reining his horse alongside the carriage But its far theyll go to beat their mother Mrs Tarleton rolled her redbrown eyes and sucked in her tower lip in burlesqued appreciation and the girls cried Ma stop making eyes or well tell Pa I vow Mr OHara she never gives us a chance when theres a handsome man like you around Scarlett laughed with the rest at these sallies but as always the freedom with which the Tarletons treated their mother came as a shock They acted as if she were one of themselves and not a day over sixteen To Scarlett the very idea of saying such things to her own mother was almost sacrilegious And yetand yetthere was something very pleasant about the Tarleton girls relations with their mother and they adored her for all that they criticized and scolded and teased her Not Scarlett loyally hastened to tell herself that she would prefer a mother like Mrs Tarleton to Ellen but still it would be fun to romp with a mother She knew that even that thought was disrespectful to Ellen and felt ashamed of it She knew no such troublesome thoughts ever disturbed the brains under the four flaming thatches in the carriage and as always when she felt herself different from her neighbors an irritated confusion fell upon her Quick though her brain was it was not made for analysis but she halfconsciously realized that for all the Tarleton girls were as unruly as colts and wild as March hares there was an unworried singlemindedness about them that was part of their inheritance On both their mothers and their fathers side they were Georgians north Georgians only a generation away from pioneers They were sure of themselves and of their environment They knew instinctively what they were about as did the Wilkeses though in widely divergent ways and in them there was no such conflict as frequently raged in Scarletts bosom where the blood of a softvoiced overbred Coast aristocrat mingled with the shrewd earthy blood of an Irish peasant Scarlett wanted to respect and adore her mother like an idol and to rumple her hair and tease her too And she knew she should be altogether one way or the other It was the same conflicting emotion that made her desire to appear a delicate and highbred lady with boys and to be as well a hoyden who was not above a few kisses Wheres Ellen this morning asked Mrs Tarleton Shes after discharging our overseer and stayed home to go over the accounts with him Wheres himself and the lads  Page    Gone With The Wind Oh they rode over to Twelve Oaks hours agoto sample the punch and see if it was strong enough I dare say as if they wouldnt have from now till tomorrow morning to do it Im going to ask John Wilkes to keep them overnight even if he has to bed them down in the stable Five men in their cups are just too much for me Up to three I do very well but Gerald hastily interrupted to change the subject He could feel his own daughters snickering behind his back as they remembered in what condition he had come home from the Wilkeses last barbecue the autumn before And why arent you riding today Mrs Tarleton Sure you dont look yourself at all without Nellie Its a stentor you are A stentor me ignorant broth of a boy cried Mrs Tarleton aping his brogue You mean a centaur Stentor was a man with a voice like a brass gong Stentor or centaur tis no matter answered Gerald unruffled by his error And tis a voice like brass you have Mam when youre urging on the hounds so it is Thats one on you Ma said Hetty I told you you yelled like a Comanche whenever you saw a fox But not as loud as you yell when Mammy washes your ears returned Mrs Tarleton And you sixteen Well as to why Im not riding today Nellie foaled early this morning Did she now cried Gerald with real interest his Irishmans passion for horses shining in his eyes and Scarlett again felt the sense of shock in comparing her mother with Mrs Tarleton To Ellen mares never foaled nor cows calved In fact hens almost didnt lay eggs Ellen ignored these matters completely But Mrs Tarleton had no such reticences A little filly was it No a fine little stallion with legs two yards long You must ride over and see him Mr OHara Hes a real Tarleton horse Hes as red as Hettys curls And looks a lot like Hetty too said Camilla and then disappeared shrieking amid a welter of skirts and pantalets and bobbing hats as Hetty who did have a long face began pinching her My fillies are feeling their oats this morning said Mrs Tarleton Theyve been kicking up their heels ever since we heard the news this morning about Ashley and that little cousin of his from Atlanta Whats her name Melanie Bless the child shes a sweet little thing but I can never remember either her name or her face Our cook is the broad wife of the Wilkes butler and he was over last night with the news that the engagement would be announced tonight and Cookie told us this morning The girls are all excited about it though I cant see why Everybodys known for years that Ashley would marry her that is if he didnt marry one of his Burr cousins from Macon Just like Honey Wilkes is going to marry Melanies brother Charles Now tell me Mr OHara is it illegal for the Wilkes to marry outside of their family Because if Scarlett did not hear the rest of the laughing words For one short instant it was as though the sun had ducked behind a cool cloud leaving the world in shadow taking the color out of things The freshly green foliage looked sickly the dogwood pallid and the flowering crab so beautifully pink a moment ago faded and dreary Scarlett dug her fingers into the upholstery of the carriage and for a moment her parasol wavered It was one thing to know that Ashley was engaged but it was another to hear people talk about it so casually Then her courage flowed strongly back and the sun came out again and the landscape glowed anew She knew Ashley loved her That was certain And she smiled as she thought how surprised Mrs Tarleton would be when no engagement was announced that nighthow surprised if there were an elopement And shed tell neighbors what a sly boots Scarlett was to sit there and listen to her talk about Melanie when all the time she and AshleyShe dimpled at her own thoughts and Hetty who had been watching sharply the effect of her mothers words sank back with a small puzzled frown I dont care what you say Mr OHara Mrs Tarleton was saying emphatically Its all wrong this marrying of cousins Its bad enough for Ashley to be marrying the Hamilton child but for Honey to be marrying that palelooking Charles Hamilton Honeyll never catch anybody else if she doesnt marry Charlie said Randa cruel and secure in her own popularity Shes never had another beau except him And hes never acted very sweet on her for all that theyre engaged Scarlett you remember how he ran after you last Christmas Dont be a cat Miss said her mother Cousins shouldnt marry even second cousins It weakens the strain It isnt like horses You can breed a mare to a brother or a sire to a daughter and get good results if you know your blood strains but in people it just doesnt work You get good lines perhaps but no stamina You Now Mam Im taking issue with you on that Can you name me better people than the Wilkes And theyve been intermarrying since Brian Boru was a boy And high time they stopped it for its beginning to show Oh not Ashley so much for hes a goodlooking devil though even he But look at those two washedoutlooking Wilkes girls poor things Nice girls of course but washed out And look at little Miss Melanie Thin as a rail and delicate enough for the wind to blow away and no spirit at all Not a notion of her own No Mam Yes Mam Thats all she has to say You see what I mean That family needs new blood fine vigorous blood like my red heads or your Scarlett Now dont misunderstand me The Wilkes are fine folks in their way and you know Im fond of them all but be frank They are overbred and inbred too arent they Theyll do fine on a dry track a fast track but mark my words I dont believe the Wilkes can run on a mud track I believe the stamina has been bred out of them and when the emergency arises I dont believe they can run against odds Dryweather stock Give me a big horse who can run in any weather And their intermarrying has made them different from other folks around here Always fiddling with the piano or sticking their heads in a book I do believe Ashley would rather read than hunt Yes I honestly believe that Mr OHara And just look at the bones on them Too slender They need dams and sires with strength Ahahhum said Gerald suddenly and guiltily aware that the conversation a most interesting and entirely proper one to him would seem quite otherwise to Ellen In fact he knew she would never recover should she learn that her daughters had been exposed to so frank a conversation But Mrs Tarleton was as usual deaf to all other ideas when pursuing her favorite topic breeding whether it be horses or humans I know what Im talking about because I had some cousins who married each other and I give you my word their children all turned out as popeyed as bullfrogs poor things And when my family wanted me to marry a second cousin I bucked like a colt I said No Ma Not for me My children will all have spavins and heaves Well Ma fainted when I said that about spavins but  Page    Gone With The Wind I stood firm and Grandma backed me up She knew a lot about horse breeding too you see and said I was right And she helped me run away with Mr Tarleton And look at my children Big and healthy and not a sickly one or a runt among them though Boyd is only five feet ten Now the Wilkes Not meaning to change the subject Mam broke in Gerald hurriedly for he had noticed Carreens bewildered look and the avid curiosity on Suellens face and feared lest they might ask Ellen embarrassing questions which would reveal how inadequate a chaperon he was Puss he was glad to notice appeared to be thinking of other matters as a lady should Hetty Tarleton rescued him from his predicament Good Heavens Ma do lets get on she cried impatiently This sun is broiling me and I can just hear freckles popping out on my neck Just a minute Mam before you go said Gerald But what have you decided to do about selling us the horses for the Troop War may break any day now and the boys want the matter settled Its a Clayton County troop and its Clayton County horses we want for them But you obstinate creature that you are are still refusing to sell us your fine beasts Maybe there wont be any war Mrs Tarleton temporized her mind diverted completely from the Wilkeses odd marriage habits Why Mam you cant Ma Hetty interrupted again cant you and Mr OHara talk about the horses at Twelve Oaks as well as here Thats just it Miss Hetty said Gerald And I wont be keeping you but one minute by the clock Well be getting to Twelve Oaks in a little bit and every man there old and young wanting to know about the horses Ah but its breaking me heart to see such a fine pretty lady as your mother so stingy with her beasts Now wheres your patriotism Mrs Tarleton Does the Confederacy mean nothing to you at all Ma cried small Betsy Randas sitting on my dress and Im getting all wrinkled Well push Randa off you Betsy and hush Now listen to me Gerald OHara she retorted her eyes beginning to snap Dont you go throwing the Confederacy in my face I reckon the Confederacy means as much to me as it does to you me with four boys in the Troop and you with none But my boys can take care of themselves and my horses cant Id gladly give the horses free of charge if I knew they were going to be ridden by boys I know gentlemen used to thoroughbreds No I wouldnt hesitate a minute But let my beauties be at the mercy of backwoodsmen and Crackers who are used to riding mules No sir Id have nightmares thinking they were being ridden with saddle galls and not groomed properly Do you think Id let ignorant fools ride my tendermouthed darlings and saw their mouths to pieces and beat them till their spirits were broken Why Ive got goose flesh this minute just thinking about it No Mr OHara youre mighty nice to want my horses but youd better go to Atlanta and buy some old plugs for your clodhoppers Theyll never know the difference Ma cant we please go on asked Camilla joining the impatient chorus You know mighty well youre going to end up giving them your darlings anyhow When Pa and the boys get through talking about the Confederacy needing them and so on youll cry and let them go Mrs Tarleton grinned and shook the lines Ill do no such thing she said touching the horses lightly with the whip The carriage went off swiftly Thats a fine woman said Gerald putting on his hat and taking his place beside his own carriage Drive on Toby Well wear her down and get the horses yet Of course shes right Shes right If a mans not a gentleman hes no business on a horse The infantry is the place for him But mores the pity theres not enough planters sons in this County to make up a full troop What did you say Puss Pa please ride behind us or in front of us You kick up such a heap of dust that were choking said Scarlett who felt that she could endure conversation no longer It distracted her from her thoughts and she was very anxious to arrange both her thoughts and her face in attractive lines before reaching Twelve Oaks Gerald obediently put spurs to his horse and was off in a red cloud after the Tarleton carriage where he could continue his horsy conversation CHAPTER VI THEY CROSSED the river and the carriage mounted the hill Even before Twelve Oaks came into view Scarlett saw a haze of smoke hanging lazily in the tops of the tall trees and smelled the mingled savory odors of burning hickory logs and roasting pork and mutton The barbecue pits which had been slowly burning since last night would now be long troughs of rosered embers with the meats turning on spits above them and the juices trickling down and hissing into the coals Scarlett knew that the fragrance carried on the faint breeze came from the grove of great oaks in the rear of the big house John Wilkes always held his barbecues there on the gentle slope leading down to the rose garden a pleasant shady place and a far pleasanter place for instance than that used by the Calverts Mrs Calvert did not like barbecue food and declared that the smells remained in the house for days so her guests always sweltered on a flat unshaded spot a quarter of a mile from the house But John Wilkes famed throughout the state for his hospitality really knew how to give a barbecue The long trestled picnic tables covered with the finest of the Wilkeses linen always stood under the thickest shade with backless benches on either side and chairs hassocks and cushions from the house were scattered about the glade for those who did not fancy the benches At a distance great enough to keep the smoke away from the guests were the long pits where the meats cooked and the huge iron washpots from which the succulent odors of barbecue sauce and Brunswick stew floated Mr Wilkes always had at least a dozen darkies busy running back and forth with trays to serve the guests Over behind the barns there was always another barbecue pit where the house servants and the coachmen and maids of the guests had their own feast of hoecakes and yams and chitterlings that dish of hog entrails so dear to negro hearts and in season watermelons enough to satiate As the smell of crisp fresh pork came to her Scarlett wrinkled her nose appreciatively hoping that by the time it was cooked she would feel some appetite As it was she was so full of food and so tightly laced that she feared every moment she was going  Page    Gone With The Wind to belch That would be fatal as only old men and very old ladies could belch without fear of social disapproval They topped the rise and the white house reared its perfect symmetry before her tall of columns wide of verandas flat of roof beautiful as a woman is beautiful who is so sure of her charm that she can be generous and gracious to all Scarlett loved Twelve Oaks even more than Tara for it had a stately beauty a mellowed dignity that Geralds house did not possess The wide curving driveway was full of saddle horses and carriages and guests alighting and calling greetings to friends Grinning negroes excited as always at a party were leading the animals to the barnyard to be unharnessed and unsaddled for the day Swarms of children black and white ran yelling about the newly green lawn playing hopscotch and tag and boasting how much they were going to eat The wide hall which ran from front to back of the house was swarming with people and as the OHara carriage drew up at the front steps Scarlett saw girls in crinolines bright as butterflies going up and coming down the stairs from the second floor arms about each others waists stopping to lean over the delicate handrail of the banisters laughing and calling to young men in the hall below them Through the open French windows she caught glimpses of the older women seated in the drawing room sedate in dark silks as they sat fanning themselves and talking of babies and sicknesses and who had married whom and why The Wilkes butler Tom was hurrying through the halls a silver tray in his hands bowing and grinning as he offered tall glasses to young men in fawn and gray trousers and fine ruffled linen shirts The sunny front veranda was thronged with guests Yes the whole County was here thought Scarlett The four Tarleton boys and their father leaned against the tall columns the twins Stuart and Brent side by side inseparable as usual Boyd and Tom with their father James Tarleton Mr Calvert was standing close by the side of his Yankee wife who even after fifteen years in Georgia never seemed to quite belong anywhere Everyone was very polite and kind to her because he felt sorry for her but no one could forget that she had compounded her initial error of birth by being the governess of Mr Calverts children The two Calvert boys Raiford and Cade were there with their dashing blonde sister Cathleen teasing the darkfaced Joe Fontaine and Sally Munroe his pretty bridetobe Alex and Tony Fontaine were whispering in the ears of Dimity Munroe and sending her into gales of giggles There were families from as far as Lovejoy ten miles away and from Fayetteville and Jonesboro a few even from Atlanta and Macon The house seemed bursting with the crowd and a ceaseless babble of talking and laughter and giggles and shrill feminine squeaks and screams rose and fell On the porch steps stood John Wilkes silverhaired erect radiating the quiet charm and hospitality that was as warm and never failing as the sun of Georgia summer Beside him Honey Wilkes so called because she indiscriminately addressed everyone from her father to the field hands by that endearment fidgeted and giggled as she called greetings to the arriving guests Honeys nervously obvious desire to be attractive to every man in sight contrasted sharply with her fathers poise and Scarlett had the thought that perhaps there was something in what Mrs Tarleton said after all Certainly the Wilkes men got the family looks The thick deepgold lashes that set off the gray eyes of John Wilkes and Ashley were sparse and colorless in the faces of Honey and her sister India Honey had the odd lashless look of a rabbit and India could be described by no other word than plain India was nowhere to be seen but Scarlett knew she probably was in the kitchen giving final instructions to the servants Poor India thought Scarlett shes had so much trouble keeping house since her mother died that shes never had the chance to catch any beau except Stuart Tarleton and it certainly wasnt my fault if he thought I was prettier than she John Wilkes came down the steps to offer his arm to Scarlett As she descended from the carriage she saw Suellen smirk and knew that she must have picked out Frank Kennedy in the crowd If I couldnt catch a better beau than that old maid in britches she thought contemptuously as she stepped to the ground and smiled her thanks to John Wilkes Frank Kennedy was hurrying to the carriage to assist Suellen and Suellen was bridling in a way that made Scarlett want to slap her Frank Kennedy might own more land than anyone in the County and he might have a very kind heart but these things counted for nothing against the fact that he was forty slight and nervous and had a thin gingercolored beard and an oldmaidish fussy way about him However remembering her plan Scarlett smothered her contempt and cast such a flashing smile of greeting at him that he stopped short his arm outheld to Suellen and goggled at Scarlett in pleased bewilderment Scarletts eyes searched the crowd for Ashley even while she made pleasant small talk with John Wilkes but he was not on the porch There were cries of greeting from a dozen voices and Stuart and Brent Tarleton moved toward her The Munroe girls rushed up to exclaim over her dress and she was speedily the center of a circle of voices that rose higher and higher in efforts to be heard above the din But where was Ashley And Melanie and Charles She tried not to be obvious as she looked about and peered down the hall into the laughing group inside As she chattered and laughed and cast quick glances into the house and the yard her eyes fell on a stranger standing alone in the hall staring at her in a cool impertinent way that brought her up sharply with a mingled feeling of feminine pleasure that she had attracted a man and an embarrassed sensation that her dress was too low in the bosom He looked quite old at least thirtyfive He was a tall man and powerfully built Scarlett thought she had never seen a man with such wide shoulders so heavy with muscles almost too heavy for gentility When her eye caught his he smiled showing animalwhite teeth below a closeclipped black mustache He was dark of face swarthy as a pirate and his eyes were as bold and black as any pirates appraising a galleon to be scuttled or a maiden to be ravished There was a cool recklessness in his face and a cynical humor in his mouth as he smiled at her and Scarlett caught her breath She felt that she should be insulted by such a look and was annoyed with herself because she did not feel insulted She did not know who he could be but there was undeniably a look of good blood in his dark face It showed in the thin hawk nose over the full red lips the high forehead and the wideset eyes She dragged her eyes away from his without smiling back and he turned as someone called Rhett Rhett Butler Come here I want you to meet the most hardhearted girl in Georgia Rhett Butler The name had a familiar sound somehow connected with something pleasantly scandalous but her mind was on Ashley and she dismissed the thought I must run upstairs and smooth my hair she told Stuart and Brent who were trying to get her cornered from the crowd You boys wait for me and dont run off with any other girl or Ill be furious  Page    Gone With The Wind She could see that Stuart was going to be difficult to handle today if she flirted with anyone else He had been drinking and wore the arrogant lookingforafight expression that she knew from experience meant trouble She paused in the hall to speak to friends and to greet India who was emerging from the back of the house her hair untidy and tiny beads of perspiration on her forehead Poor India It would be bad enough to have pale hair and eyelashes and a hitting chin that meant a stubborn disposition without being twenty years old and an old maid in the bargain She wondered if India resented very much her taking Stuart away from her Lots of people said she was still in love with him but then you could never tell what a Wilkes was thinking about If she did resent it she never gave any sign of it treating Scarlett with the same slightly aloof kindly courtesy she had always shown her Scarlett spoke pleasantly to her and started up the wide stairs As she did a shy voice behind her called her name and turning she saw Charles Hamilton He was a nicelooking boy with a riot of soft brown curls on his white forehead and eyes as deep brown as clean and as gentle as a collie dogs He was well turned out in mustardcolored trousers and black coat and his pleated shirt was topped by the widest and most fashionable of black cravats A faint blush was creeping over his face as she turned for he was timid with girls Like most shy men he greatly admired airy vivacious alwaysatease girls like Scarlett She had never given him more than perfunctory courtesy before and so the beaming smile of pleasure with which she greeted him and the two hands outstretched to his almost took his breath away Why Charles Hamilton you handsome old thing you Ill bet you came all the way down here from Atlanta just to break my poor heart Charles almost stuttered with excitement holding her warm little hands in his and looking into the dancing green eyes This was the way girls talked to other boys but never to him He never knew why but girls always treated him like a younger brother and were very kind but never bothered to tease him He had always wanted girls to flirt end frolic with him as they did with boys much less handsome and less endowed with this worlds goods than he But on the few occasions when this had happened he could never think of anything to say and he suffered agonies of embarrassment at his dumbness Then he lay awake at night thinking of all the charming gallantries he might have employed but he rarely got a second chance for the girls left him alone after a trial or two Even with Honey with whom he had an unspoken understanding of marriage when he came into his property next fall he was diffident and silent At times he had an ungallant feeling that Honeys coquetries and proprietary airs were no credit to him for she was so boycrazy he imagined she would use them on any man who gave her the opportunity Charles was not excited over the prospect of marrying her for she stirred in him none of the emotions of wild romance that his beloved books had assured him were proper for a lover He had always yearned to be loved by some beautiful dashing creature full of fire and mischief And here was Scarlett OHara teasing him about breaking her heart He tried to think of something to say and couldnt and silently he blessed her because she kept up a steady chatter which relieved him of any necessity for conversation It was too good to be true Now you wait right here till I come back for I want to eat barbecue with you And dont you go off philandering with those other girls because Im mighty jealous came the incredible words from red lips with a dimple on each side and briskly black lashes swept demurely over green eyes I wont he finally managed to breathe never dreaming that she was thinking he looked like a calf waiting for the butcher Tapping him lightly on the arm with her folded fan she turned to start up the stairs and her eyes again fell on the man called Rhett Butler who stood alone a few feet away from Charles Evidently he had overheard the whole conversation for he grinned up at her as maliciously as a tomcat and again his eyes went over her in a gaze totally devoid of the deference she was accustomed to Gods nightgown said Scarlett to herself in indignation using Geralds favorite oath He looks as ifas if he knew what I looked like without my shimmy and tossing her head she went up the steps In the bedroom where the wraps were laid she found Cathleen Calvert preening before the mirror and biting her lips to make them look redder There were fresh roses in her sash that matched her cheeks and her cornflowerblue eyes were dancing with excitement Cathleen said Scarlett trying to pull the corsage of her dress higher who is that nasty man downstairs named Butler My dear dont you know whispered Cathleen excitedly a weather eye on the next room where Dilcey and the Wilkes girls mammy were gossiping I cant imagine how Mr Wilkes must feel having him here but he was visiting Mr Kennedy in Jonesborosomething about buying cottonand of course Mr Kennedy had to bring him along with him He couldnt just go off and leave him What is the matter with him My dear he isnt received Not really No Scarlett digested this in silence for she had never before been under the same roof with anyone who was not received It was very exciting What did he do Oh Scarlett he has the most terrible reputation His name is Rhett Butler and hes from Charleston and his folks are some of the nicest people there but they wont even speak to him Caro Rhett told me about him last summer He isnt any kin to her family but she knows all about him everybody does He was expelled from West Point Imagine And for things too bad for Caro to know And then there was that business about the girl he didnt marry Do tell me Darling dont you know anything Caro told me all about it last summer and her mama would die if she thought Caro even knew about it Well this Mr Butler took a Charleston girl out buggy riding I never did know who she was but Ive got my suspicions She couldnt have been very nice or she wouldnt have gone out with him in the late afternoon without a chaperon  Page    Gone With The Wind And my dear they stayed out nearly all night and walked home finally saying the horse had run away and smashed the buggy and they had gotten lost in the woods And guess what I cant guess Tell me said Scarlett enthusiastically hoping for the worst He refused to marry her the next day Oh said Scarlett her hopes dashed He said he hadnterdone anything to her and he didnt see why he should marry her And of course her brother called him out and Mr Butler said hed rather be shot than marry a stupid fool And so they fought a duel and Mr Butler shot the girls brother and he died and Mr Butler had to leave Charleston and now nobody receives him finished Cathleen triumphantly and just in time for Dilcey came back into the room to oversee the toilet of her charge Did she have a baby whispered Scarlett in Cathleens ear Cathleen shook her head violently But she was ruined just the same she hissed back I wish I had gotten Ashley to compromise me thought Scarlett suddenly Hed be too much of a gentleman not to marry me But somehow unbidden she had a feeling of respect for Rhett Butler for refusing to marry a girl who was a fool Scarlett sat on a high rosewood ottoman under the shade of a huge oak in the rear of the house her flounces and ruffles billowing about her and two inches of green morocco slippersall that a lady could show and still remain a ladypeeping from beneath them She had scarcely touched plate in her hands and seven cavaliers about her The barbecue had reached its peak and the warm air was full of laughter and talk the click of silver on porcelain and the rich heavy smells of roasting meats and redolent gravies Occasionally when the slight breeze veered puffs of smoke from the long barbecue pits floated over the crowd and were greeted with squeals of mock dismay from the ladies and violent flappings of palmetto fans Most of the young ladies were seated with partners on the long benches that faced the tables but Scarlett realizing that a girl has only two sides and only one man can sit on each of these sides had elected to sit apart so she could gather about her as many men as possible Under the arbor sat the married women their dark dresses decorous notes in the surrounding color and gaiety Matrons regardless of their ages always grouped together apart from the brighteyed girls beaux and laughter for there were no married belles in the South From Grandma Fontaine who was belching frankly with the privilege of her age to seventeenyearold Alice Munroe struggling against the nausea of a first pregnancy they had their heads together in the endless genealogical and obstetrical discussions that made such gatherings very pleasant and instructive affairs Casting contemptuous glances at them Scarlett thought that they looked like a clump of fat crows Married women never had any fun It did not occur to her that if she married Ashley she would automatically be relegated to arbors and front parlors with staid matrons in dull silks as staid and dull as they and not a part of the fun and frolicking Like most girls her imagination carried her just as far as the altar and no further Besides she was too unhappy now to pursue an abstraction She dropped her eyes to her plate and nibbled daintily on a beaten biscuit with an elegance and an utter lack of appetite that would have won Mammys approval For all that she had a superfluity of beaux she had never been more miserable in her life In some way that she could not understand her plans of last night had failed utterly so far as Ashley was concerned She had attracted other beaux by the dozens but not Ashley and all the fears of yesterday afternoon were sweeping back upon her making her heart beat fast and then slow and color flame and whiten in her cheeks Ashley had made no attempt to join the circle about her in fact she had not had a word alone with him since arriving or even spoken to him since their first greeting He had come forward to welcome her when she came into the back garden but Melanie had been on his arm then Melanie who hardly came up to his shoulder She was a tiny frailly built girl who gave the appearance of a child masquerading in her mothers enormous hoop skirtsan illusion that was heightened by the shy almost frightened look in her too large brown eyes She had a cloud of curly dark hair which was so sternly repressed beneath its net that no vagrant tendrils escaped and this dark mass with its long widows peak accentuated the heart shape of her face Too wide across the cheek bones too pointed at the chin it was a sweet timid face but a plain face and she had no feminine tricks of allure to make observers forget its plainness She lookedand wasas simple as earth as good as bread as transparent as spring water But for all her plainness of feature and smallness of stature there was a sedate dignity about her movements that was oddly touching and far older than her seventeen years Her gray organdie dress with its cherrycolored satin sash disguised with its billows and ruffles how childishly undeveloped her body was and the yellow hat with long cherry streamers made her creamy skin glow Her heavy earbobs with their long gold fringe hung down from loops of tidily netted hair swinging close to her brown eyes eyes that had the still gleam of a forest pool in winter when brown leaves shine up through quiet water She had smiled with timid liking when she greeted Scarlett and told her how pretty her green dress was and Scarlett had been hard put to be even civil in reply so violently did she want to speak alone with Ashley Since then Ashley had sat on a stool at Melanies feet apart from the other guests and talked quietly with her smiling the slow drowsy smile that Scarlett loved What made matters worse was that under his smile a little sparkle had come into Melanies eyes so that even Scarlett had to admit that she looked almost pretty As Melanie looked at Ashley her plain face lit up as with an inner fire for if ever a loving heart showed itself upon a face it was showing now on Melanie Hamiltons Scarlett tried to keep her eyes from these two but could not and after each glance she redoubled her gaiety with her cavaliers laughing saying daring things teasing tossing her head at their compliments until her earrings danced She said fiddledeedee many times declared that the truth wasnt in any of them and vowed that shed never believe anything any man told her But Ashley did not seem to notice her at all He only looked up at Melanie and talked on and Melanie looked down at him with an expression that radiated the fact that she belonged to him So Scarlett was miserable To the outward eye never had a girl less cause to he miserable She was undoubtedly the belle of the barbecue the center of attention The furore she was causing among the men coupled with the heart burnings of the other girls would have pleased her  Page    Gone With The Wind enormously at any other time Charles Hamilton emboldened by her notice was firmly planted on her right refusing to be dislodged by the combined efforts of the Tarteton twins He held her fan in one hand and his untouched plate of barbecue in the other and stubbornly refused to meet the eyes of Honey who seemed on the verge of an outburst of tears Cade lounged gracefully on her left plucking at her skirt to attract her attention and staring up with smoldering eyes at Stuart Already the air was electric between him and the twins and rude words had passed Frank Kennedy fussed about like a hen with one chick running back and forth from the shade of the oak to the tables to fetch dainties to tempt Scarlett as if there were not a dozen servants there for that purpose As a result Suellens sullen resentment had passed beyond the point of ladylike concealment and she glowered at Scarlett Small Carreen could have cried because for all Scarletts encouraging words that morning Brent had done no more than say Hello Sis and jerk her hair ribbon before turning his full attention to Scarlett Usually he was so kind and treated her with a careless deference that made her feel grown up and Carreen secretly dreamed of the day when she would put her hair up and her skirts down and receive him as a real beau And now it seemed that Scarlett had him The Munroe girls were concealing their chagrin at the defection of the swarthy Fontaine boys but they were annoyed at the way Tony and Alex stood about the circle jockeying for a position near Scarlett should any of the others arise from their places They telegraphed their disapproval of Scarletts conduct to Hetty Tarleton by delicately raised eyebrows Fast was the only word for Scarlett Simultaneously the three young ladies raised lacy parasols said they had had quite enough to eat thank you and laying light fingers on the arms of the men nearest them clamored sweetly to see the rose garden the spring and the summerhouse This strategic retreat in good order was not lost on a woman present or observed by a man Scarlett giggled as she saw three men dragged out of the line of her charms to investigate landmarks familiar to the girls from childhood and cut her eye sharply to see if Ashley had taken note But he was playing with the ends of Melanies sash and smiling up at her Pain twisted Scarletts heart She felt that she could claw Melanies ivory skin till the blood ran and take pleasure in doing it As her eyes wandered from Melanie she caught the gaze of Rhett Butler who was not mixing with the crowd but standing apart talking to John Wilkes He had been watching her and when she looked at him he laughed outright Scarlett had an uneasy feeling that this man who was not received was the only one present who knew what lay behind her wild gaiety and that it was affording him sardonic amusement She could have clawed him with pleasure too If I can just live through this barbecue till this afternoon she thought all the girls will go upstairs to take naps to be fresh for tonight and Ill stay downstairs and get to talk to Ashley Surely he must have noticed how popular I am She soothed her heart with another hope Of course he has to be attentive to Melanie because after all she is his cousin and she isnt popular at all and if he didnt look out for her shed just be a wallflower She took new courage at this thought and redoubled her efforts in the direction of Charles whose brown eyes glowed down eagerly at her It was a wonderful day for Charles a dream day and he had fallen in love with Scarlett with no effort at all Before this new emotion Honey receded into a dim haze Honey was a shrillvoiced sparrow and Scarlett a gleaming hummingbird She teased him and favored him and asked him questions and answered them herself so that he appeared very clever without having to say a word The other boys were puzzled and annoyed by her obvious interest in him for they knew Charles was too shy to hitch two consecutive words together and politeness was being severely strained to conceal their growing rage Everyone was smoldering and it would have been a positive triumph for Scarlett except for Ashley When the last forkful of pork and chicken and mutton had been eaten Scarlett hoped the time had come when India would rise and suggest that the ladies retire to the house It was two oclock and the sun was warm overhead but India wearied with the threeday preparations for the barbecue was only too glad to remain sitting beneath the arbor shouting remarks to a deaf old gentleman from Fayetteville A lazy somnolence descended on the crowd The negroes idled about clearing the long tables on which the food had been laid The laughter and talking became less animated and groups here and there fell silent All were waiting for their hostess to signal the end of the mornings festivities Palmetto fans were wagging more slowly and several gentlemen were nodding from the heat and overloaded stomachs The barbecue was over and all were content to take their ease while sun was at its height In this interval between the morning party and the evenings ball they seemed a placid peaceful lot Only the young men retained the restless energy which had filled the whole throng a short while before Moving from group to group drawling in their soft voices they were as handsome as blooded stallions and as dangerous The languor of midday had taken hold of the gathering but underneath lurked tempers that could rise to killing heights in a second and flare out as quickly Men and women they were beautiful and wild all a little violent under their pleasant ways and only a little tamed Some time dragged by while the sun grew hotter and Scarlett and others looked again toward India Conversation was dying out when in the lull everyone in the grove heard Geralds voice raised in furious accents Standing some little distance away from the barbecue tables he was at the peak of an argument with John Wilkes Gods nightgown man Pray for a peaceable settlement with the Yankees After weve fired on the rascals at Fort Sumter Peaceable The South should show by arms that she cannot be insulted and that she is not leaving the Union by the Unions kindness but by her own strength Oh my God thought Scarlett Hes done it Now well all sit here till midnight In an instant the somnolence had fled from the lounging throng and something electric went snapping through the air The men sprang from benches and chain arms in wide gestures voices clashing for the right to be heard above other voices There had been no talk of politics or impending war all during the morning because of Mr Wilkes request that the ladies should not be bored But now Gerald had bawled the words Fort Sumter and every man present forgot his hosts admonition Of course well fight Yankee thieves We could lick them in a month Why one Southerner can lick twenty Yankees Teach them a lesson they wont soon forget Peaceably They wont let us go in peace No look how Mr Lincoln insulted our Commissioners Yes kept them hanging around for weeksswearing hed have Sumter evacuated They want war well make them sick of war And above all the voices Geralds boomed All Scarlett could hear was States  Page    Gone With The Wind rights by God shouted over and over Gerald was having an excellent time but not his daughter Secession warthese words long since had become acutely boring to Scarlett from much repetition but now she hated the sound of them for they meant that the men would stand there for hours haranguing one another and she would have no chance to corner Ashley Of course there would be no war and the men all knew it They just loved to talk and hear themselves talk Charles Hamilton had not risen with the others and finding himself comparatively alone with Scarlett he leaned closer and with the daring born of new love whispered a confession Miss OHaraII had already decided that if we did fight Id go over to South Carolina and join a troop there Its said that Mr Wade Hampton is organizing a cavalry troop and of course I would want to go with him Hes a splendid person and was my fathers best friend Scarlett thought What am I supposed to dogive three cheers for Charles expression showed that he was baring his hearts secrets to her She could think of nothing to say and so merely looked at him wondering why men were such fools as to think women interested in such matters He took her expression to mean stunned approbation and went on rapidly daringly If I wentwouldwould you be sorry Miss OHara I should cry into my pillow every night said Scarlett meaning to be flippant but he took the statement at face value and went red with pleasure Her hand was concealed in the folds of her dress and he cautiously wormed his hand to it and squeezed it overwhelmed at his own boldness and at her acquiescence Would you pray for me What a fool thought Scarlett bitterly casting a surreptitious glance about her in the hope of being rescued from the conversation Would you Ohyes indeed Mr Hamilton Three Rosaries a night at least Charles gave a swift look about him drew in his breath stiffened the muscles of his stomach They were practically alone and he might never get another such opportunity And even given another such Godsent occasion his courage might fail him Miss OHaraI must tell you something II love you Um said Scarlett absently trying to peer through the crowd of arguing men to where Ashley still sat talking at Melanies feet Yes whispered Charles in a rapture that she had neither laughed screamed nor fainted as he had always imagined young girls did under such circumstances I love you You are the mostthe most and he found his tongue for the first time in his life The most beautiful girl Ive ever known and the sweetest and the kindest and you have the dearest ways and I love you with all my heart I cannot hope that you could love anyone like me but my dear Miss OHara if you can give me any encouragement I will do anything in the world to make you love me I will Charles stopped for he couldnt think of anything difficult enough of accomplishment to really prove to Scarlett the depth of his feeling so he said simply I want to marry you Scarlett came back to earth with a jerk at the sound of the word marry She had been thinking of marriage and of Ashley and she looked at Charles with poorly concealed irritation Why must this calflike fool intrude his feelings on this particular day when she was so worried she was about to lose her mind She looked into the pleading brown eyes and she saw none of the beauty of a shy boys first love of the adoration of an ideal come true or the wild happiness and tenderness that were sweeping through him like a flame Scarlett was used to men asking her to marry them men much more attractive than Charles Hamilton and men who had more finesse than to propose at a barbecue when she had more important matters on her mind She only saw a boy of twenty red as a beet and looking very silly She wished that she could tell him how silly he looked But automatically the words Ellen had taught her to say in such emergencies rose to her lips and casting down her eyes from force of long habit she murmured Mr Hamilton I am not unaware of the honor you have bestowed on me in wanting me to become your wife but this is all so sudden that I do not know what to say That was a neat way of smoothing a mans vanity and yet keeping him on the string and Charles rose to it as though such bait were new and he the first to swallow it I would wait forever I wouldnt want you unless you were quite sure Please Miss OHara tell me that I may hope Um said Scarlett her sharp eyes noting that Ashley who had not risen to take part in the war talk was smiling up at Melanie If this fool who was grappling for her hand would only keep quiet for a moment perhaps she could hear what they were saying She must hear what they said What did Melanie say to him that brought that look of interest to his eyes Charles words blurred the voices she strained to hear Oh hush she hissed at him pinching his hand and not even looking at him Startled at first abashed Charles blushed at the rebuff and then seeing how her eyes were fastened on his sister he smiled Scarlett was afraid someone might hear his words She was naturally embarrassed and shy and in agony lest they be overheard Charles felt a surge of masculinity such as he had never experienced for this was the first time in his life that he had ever embarrassed any girl The thrill was intoxicating He arranged his face in what he fancied was an expression of careless unconcern and cautiously returned Scarletts pinch to show that he was man of the world enough to understand and accept her reproof She did not even feel his pinch for she could hear clearly the sweet voice that was Melanies chief charm I fear I cannot agree with you about Mr Thackerays works He is a cynic I fear be is not the gentleman Mr Dickens is What a silly thing to say to a man thought Scarlett ready to giggle with relief Why shes no more than a bluestocking and everyone knows what men think of bluestockings  The way to get a man interested and to hold his interest was to talk about him and then gradually lead the conversation around to yourselfand keep it there Scarlett would have felt some cause for alarm if Melanie had been saying How wonderful you are or How do you ever think of such things My little ole brain would bust if I even tried to think about them But here she was with a man at her feet talking as seriously as if she were in church The prospect looked brighter to Scarlett so bright in fact that she turned beaming eyes on Charles and smiled from pure  Page    Gone With The Wind joy Enraptured at this evidence of her affection he grabbed up her fan and plied it so enthusiastically her hair began to blow about untidily Ashley you have not favored us with your opinion said Jim Tarleton turning from the group of shouting men and with an apology Ashley excused himself and rose There was no one there so handsome thought Scarlett as she marked how graceful was his negligent pose and how the sun gleamed on his gold hair and mustache Even the older men stopped to listen to his words Why gentlemen if Georgia fights Ill go with her Why else would I have joined the Troop he said His gray eyes opened wide and their drowsiness disappeared in an intensity that Scarlett had never seen before But like Father I hope the Yankees will let us go in peace and that there will be no fighting He held up his hand with a smile as a babel of voices from the Fontaine and Tarleton boys began Yes yes I know weve been insulted and lied tobut if wed been in the Yankees shoes and they were trying to leave the Union how would we have acted Pretty much the same We wouldnt have liked it There he goes again thought Scarlett Always putting himself in the other fellows shoes To her there was never but one fair side to an argument Sometimes there was no understanding Ashley Lets dont be too hot headed and lets dont have any war Most of the misery of the world has been caused by wars And when the wars were over no one ever knew what they were all about Scarlett sniffed Lucky for Ashley that he had an unassailable reputation for courage or else thered be trouble As she thought this the clamor of dissenting voices rose up about Ashley indignant fiery Under the arbor the deaf old gentleman from Fayetteville punched India Whats it all about What are they saying War shouted India cupping her hand to his ear They want to fight the Yankees War is it he cried fumbling about him for his cane and heaving himself out of his chair with more energy than he had shown in years Ill tell um about war Ive been there It was not often that Mr McRae had the opportunity to talk about war the way his women folks shushed him He stumped rapidly to the group waving his cane and shouting and because he could not hear the voices about him he soon had undisputed possession of the field You fireeating young bucks listen to me You dont want to fight I fought and I know Went out in the Seminole War and was a big enough fool to go to the Mexican War too You all dont know what war is You think its riding a pretty horse and having the girls throw flowers at you and coming home a hero Well it aint No sir Its going hungry and getting the measles and pneumonia from sleeping in the wet And if it aint measles and pneumonia if s your bowels Yes sir what war does to a mans bowelsdysentery and things like that The ladies were pink with blushes Mr McRae was a reminder of a cruder era like Grandma Fontaine and her embarrassingly loud belches an era everyone would like to forget Run get your grandpa hissed one of the old gentlemans daughters to a young girl standing near by I declare she whispered to the fluttering matrons about her he gets worse every day Would you believe it this very morning he said to Maryand shes only sixteen Now Missy   And the voice went off into a whisper as the granddaughter slipped out to try to induce Mr McRae to return to his seat in the shade Of all the group that milled about under the trees girls smiling excitedly men talking impassionedly there was only one who seemed calm Scarletts eyes turned to Rhett Butler who leaned against a tree his hands shoved deep in his trouser pockets He stood alone since Mr Wilkes had left his side and had uttered no word as the conversation grew hotter The red lips under the closeclipped black mustache curled down and there was a glint of amused contempt in his black eyescontempt as if he lis tened to the braggings of children A very disagreeable smile Scarlett thought He listened quietly until Stuart Tarleton his red hair tousled and his eyes gleaming repeated Why we could lick them in a month Gentlemen always fight better than rabble A monthwhy one battle Gentlemen said Rhett Butler in a flat drawl that bespoke his Charleston birth not moving from his position against the tree or taking his hands from his pockets may I say a word There was contempt in his manner as in his eyes contempt overlaid with an air of courtesy that somehow burlesqued their own manners The group turned toward him and accorded him the politeness always due an outsider Has any one of you gentlemen ever thought that theres not a cannon factory south of the MasonDixon Line Or how few iron foundries there are in the South Or woolen mills or cotton factories or tanneries Have you thought that we would not have a single warship and that the Yankee fleet could bottle up our harbors in a week so that we could not sell our cotton abroad Butof courseyou gentlemen have thought of these things Why he means the boys are a passel of fools thought Scarlett indignantly the hot blood coming to her cheeks Evidently she was not the only one to whom this idea occurred for several of the boys were beginning to stick out their chins John Wilkes casually but swiftly came back to his place beside the speaker as if to impress on all present that this man was his guest and that moreover there were ladies present The trouble with most of us Southerners continued Rhett Butler is that we either dont travel enough or we dont profit enough by our travels Now of course all you gentlemen are well traveled But what have you seen Europe and New York and Philadelphia and of course the ladies have been to Saratoga he bowed slightly to the group under the arbor Youve seen the hotels and the museums and the balls and the gambling houses And youve come home believing that theres no place like the South As for me I was Charleston born but I have spent the last few years in the North His white teeth showed in a grin as though he realized that everyone present knew just why he no longer lived in Charleston and cared not at all if they did know I have seen many things that you all have not seen The thousands of immigrants whod be glad to fight for the Yankees for food and a few dollars the factories the foundries the shipyards the iron and coal minesall the things we havent got Why all we have is cotton and slaves and arrogance Theyd lick us in a month For a tense moment there was silence Rhett Butler removed a fine linen handkerchief from his coat pocket and idly flicked  Page    Gone With The Wind dust from his sleeve Then an ominous murmuring arose in the crowd and from under the arbor came a humming as unmistakable as that of a hive of newly disturbed bees Even while she felt the hot blood of wrath still in her cheeks something in Scarletts practical mind prompted the thought that what this man said was right and it sounded like common sense Why shed never even seen a factory or known anyone who had seen a factory But even if it were true he was no gentleman to make such a statementand at a party too where everyone was having a good time Stuart Tarleton brows lowering came forward with Brent close at his heels Of course the Tarleton twins had nice manners and they wouldnt make a scene at a barbecue even though tremendously provoked Just the same all the ladies felt pleasantly excited for it was so seldom that they actually saw a scene or a quarrel Usually they had to hear of it thirdhand Sir said Stuart heavily what do you mean Rhett looked at him with polite but mocking eyes I mean he answered what Napoleonperhaps youve heard of himremarked once God is on the side of the strongest battalion  and turning to John Wilkes he said with courtesy that was unfeigned You promised to show me your library sir Would it be too great a favor to ask to see it now I fear I must go back to Jonesboro early this afternoon where a bit of business calls me He swung about facing the crowd clicked his heels together and bowed like a dancing master a bow that was graceful for so powerful a man and as full of impertinence as a slap in the face Then he walked across the lawn with John Wilkes his black head in the air and the sound of his discomforting laughter floated back to the group about the tables There was a startled silence and then the buzzing broke out again India rose tiredly from her seat beneath the arbor and went toward the angry Stuart Tarleton Scarlett could not hear what she said but the look in her eyes as she gazed up into his lowering face gave Scarlett something like a twinge of conscience It was the same look of belonging that Melanie wore when she looked at Ashley only Stuart did not see it So India did love him Scarlett thought for an instant that if she had not flirted so blatantly with Stuart at that political speaking a year ago he might have married India long ere this But then the twinge passed with the comforting thought that it wasnt her fault if other girls couldnt keep their men Finally Stuart smiled down at India an unwilling smile and nodded his head Probably India had been pleading with him not to follow Mr Butler and make trouble A polite tumult broke out under the trees as the guests arose shaking crumbs from laps The married women called to nurses and small children and gathered their broods together to take their departure and groups of girls started off laughing and talking toward the house to exchange gossip in the upstairs bedrooms and to take their naps All the ladies except Mrs Tarleton moved out of the back yard leaving the shade of oaks and arbor to the men She was detained by Gerald Mr Calvert and the others who wanted an answer from her about the horses for the Troop Ashley strolled over to where Scarlett and Charles sat a thoughtful and amused smile on his face Arrogant devil isnt he he observed looking after Butler He looks like one of the Borgias Scarlett thought quickly but could remember no family in the County or Atlanta or Savannah by that name I dont know them Is he kin to them Who are they An odd look came over Charles face incredulity and shame struggling with love Love triumphed as he realized that it was enough for a girl to be sweet and gentle and beautiful without having an education to hamper her charms and he made swift answer The Borgias were Italians Oh said Scarlett losing interest foreigners She turned her prettiest smile on Ashley but for some reason he was not looking at her He was looking at Charles and there was understanding in his face and a little pity Scarlett stood on the landing and peered cautiously over the banisters into the hall below It was empty From the bedrooms on the floor above came an unending hum of low voices rising and falling punctuated with squeaks of laughter and Now you didnt really and What did he say then On the beds and couches of the six great bedrooms the girls were resting their dresses off their stays loosed their hair flowing down their backs Afternoon naps were a custom of the country and never were they so necessary as on the allday parties beginning early in the morning and culminating in a ball For half an hour the girls would chatter and laugh and then servants would pull the shutters and in the warm halfgloom the talk would die to whispers and finally expire in silence broken only by soft regular breathing Scarlett had made certain that Melanie was lying down on the bed with Honey and Hetty Tarleton before she slipped into the hall and started down the stairs From the window on the landing she could see the group of men sitting under the arbor drinking from tall glasses and she knew they would remain there until late afternoon Her eyes searched the group but Ashley was not among them Then she listened and she heard his voice As she had hoped he was still in the front driveway bidding goodby to departing matrons and children Her heart in her throat she went swiftly down the stairs What if she should meet Mr Wilkes What excuse could she give for prowling about the house when all the other girls were getting their beauty naps Well that had to be risked As she reached the bottom step she heard the servants moving about in the dining room under the butlers orders lifting out the table and chairs in preparation for the dancing Across the wide hall was the open door of the library and she sped into it noiselessly She could wait there until Ashley finished his adieux and then call to him when he came into the house The library was in semidarkness for the blinds had been drawn against the sun The dim room with towering walls completely filled with dark books depressed her It was not the place which she would have chosen for a tryst such as she hoped this one would be Large numbers of books always depressed her as did people who liked to read large numbers of books That isall people except Ashley The heavy furniture rose up at her in the halflight highbacked chairs with deep seats and wide arms made for the tall Wilkes men squatty soft chairs of velvet with velvet hassocks before them for the girls Far across the long room before the hearth the sevenfoot sofa Ashleys favorite seat reared its high back like some huge sleeping animal She closed the door except for a crack and tried to make her heart beat more slowly She tried to remember just exactly what she had planned last night to say to Ashley but she couldnt recall anything Had she thought up something and forgotten itor  Page    Gone With The Wind had she only planned that Ashley should say something to her She couldnt remember and a sudden cold fright fell upon her If her heart would only stop pounding in her ears perhaps she could think of what to say But the quick thudding only increased as she heard him call a final farewell and walk into the front hall All she could think of was that she loved himeverything about him from the proud lift of his gold head to his slender dark boots loved his laughter even when it mystified her loved his bewildering silences Oh if only he would walk in on her now and take her in his arms so she would be spared the need of saying anything He must love herPerhaps if I prayed She squeezed her eyes tightly and began gabbling to herself Hail Mary full of grace Why Scarlett said Ashleys voice breaking in through the roaring in her ears and throwing her into utter confusion He stood in the hall peering at her through the partly opened door a quizzical smile on his face Who are you hiding fromCharles or the Tarletons She gulped So he had noticed how the men had swarmed about her How unutterably dear he was standing there with his eyes twinkling all unaware of her excitement She could not speak but she put out a hand and drew him into the room He entered puzzled but interested There was a tenseness about her a glow in her eyes that he had never seen before and even in the dim light he could see the rosy flush on her cheeks Automatically be closed the door behind him and took her hand What is it he said almost in a whisper At the touch of his hand she began to tremble It was going to happen now just as she had dreamed it A thousand incoherent thoughts shot through her mind and she could not catch a single one to mold into a word She could only shake and look up into his face Why didnt he speak What is it he repeated A secret to tell me Suddenly she found her tongue and just as suddenly all the years of Ellens teachings fell away and the forthright Irish blood of Gerald spoke from his daughters lips Yesa secret I love you For an instance there was a silence so acute it seemed that neither of them even breathed Then the trembling fell away from her as happiness and pride surged through her Why hadnt she done this before How much simpler than all the ladylike maneuverings she had been taught And then her eyes sought his There was a look of consternation in them of incredulity and something morewhat was it Yes Gerald had looked that way the day his pet hunter had broken his leg and he had had to shoot him Why did she have to think of that now Such a silly thought And why did Ashley look so oddly and say nothing Then something like a welltrained mask came down over his face and he smiled gallantly Isnt it enough that youve collected every other mans heart here today he said with the old teasing caressing note in his voice Do you want to make it unanimous Well youve always had my heart you know You cut your teeth on it Something was wrongall wrong This was not the way she had planned it Through the mad tearing of ideas round and round in her brain one was beginning to take form Somehowfor some reasonAshley was acting as if he thought she was just flirting with him But he knew differently She knew he did AshleyAshleytell meyou mustoh dont tease me now Have I your heart Oh my dear I lo His hand went across her lips swiftly The mask was gone You must not say these things Scarlett You mustnt You dont mean them Youll hate yourself for saying them and youll hate me for hearing them She jerked her head away A hot swift current was running through her I couldnt ever hate you I tell you I love you and I know you must care about me because She stopped Never before had she seen so much misery in anyones face Ashley do you careyou do dont you Yes he said dully I care If he had said he loathed her she could not have been more frightened She plucked at his sleeve speechless Scarlett he said cant we go away and forget that we have ever said these things No she whispered I cant What do you mean Dont you want toto marry me He replied Im going to marry Melanie Somehow she found that she was sitting on the low velvet chair and Ashley on the hassock at her feet was holding both her hands in his in a hard grip He was saying thingsthings that made no sense Her mind was quite blank quite empty of all the thoughts that had surged through it only a moment before and his words made no more impression than rain on glass They fell on unhearing ears words that were swift and tender and full of pity like a father speaking to a hurt child The sound of Melanies name caught in her consciousness and she looked into his crystalgray eyes She saw in them the old remoteness that had always baffled herand a look of selfhatred Father is to announce the engagement tonight We are to be married soon I should have told you but I thought you knew I thought everyone knewhad known for years I never dreamed that you Youve so many beaux I thought Stuart Life and feeling and comprehension were beginning to flow back into her But you just said you cared for me His warm hands hurt hers My dear must you make me say things that will hurt you Her silence pressed him on How can I make you see these things my dear You who are so young and unthinking that you do not know what marriage means I know I love you Love isnt enough to make a successful marriage when two people are as different as we are You would want all of a man Scarlett his body his heart his soul his thoughts And if you did not have them you would be miserable And I couldnt give you all of me I couldnt give all of me to anyone And I would not want an of your mind and your soul And you would be hurt  Page    Gone With The Wind and then you would come to hate mehow bitterly You would hate the books I read and the music I loved because they took me away from you even for a moment And Iperhaps I Do you love her She is like me part of my blood and we understand each other Scarlett Scarlett Cant I make you see that a marriage cant go on in any sort of peace unless the two people are alike Some one else had said that Like must marry like or therell be no happiness Who was it It seemed a million years since she had heard that but it still did not make sense But you said you cared I shouldnt have said it Somewhere in her brain a slow fire rose and rage began to blot out everything else Well having been cad enough to say it His face went white I was a cad to say it as Im going to marry Melanie I did you a wrong and Melanie a greater one I should not have said it for I knew you wouldnt understand How could I help caring for youyou who have all the passion for life that I have not You who can love and hate with a violence impossible to me Why you are as elemental as fire and wind and wild things and I She thought of Melanie and saw suddenly her quiet brown eyes with their faroff look her placid little hands in their black lace mitts her gentle silences And then her rage broke the same rage that drove Gerald to murder and other Irish ancestors to misdeeds that cost them their necks There was nothing in her now of the wellbred Robillards who could bear with white silence anything the world might cast Why dont you say it you coward Youre afraid to marry me Youd rather live with that stupid little fool who cant open her mouth except to say Yes or No and raise a passel of mealymouthed brats just like her Why You must not say these things about Melanie  I mustnt be damned to you Who are you to tell me I mustnt You coward you cad you You made me believe you were going to marry me Be fair his voice pleaded Did I ever She did not want to be fair although she knew what he said was true He had never once crossed the borders of friendliness with her and when she thought of this fresh anger rose the anger of hurt pride and feminine vanity She had run after him and he would have none of her He preferred a wheyfaced little fool like Melanie to her Oh far better that she had followed Ellen and Mammys precepts and never never revealed that she even liked himbetter anything than to be faced with this scorching shame She sprang to her feet her hands clenched and he rose towering over her his face full of the mute misery of one forced to face realities when realities are agonies I shall hate you till I die you cadyou lowdownlowdown What was the word she wanted She could not think of any word bad enough Scarlettplease He put out his hand toward her and as he did she slapped him across the face with all the strength she had The noise cracked like a whip in the still room and suddenly her rage was gone and there was desolation in her heart The red mark of her hand showed plainly on his white tired face He said nothing but lifted her limp hand to his lips and kissed it Then he was gone before she could speak again closing the door softly behind him She sat down again very suddenly the reaction from her rage making her knees feel weak He was gone and the memory of his stricken face would haunt her till she died She heard the soft muffled sound of his footsteps dying away down the long hall and the complete enormity of her actions came over her She had lost him forever Now he would hate her and every time he looked at her he would remember how she threw herself at him when he had given her no encouragement at all Im as bad as Honey Wilkes she thought suddenly and remembered how everyone and she more than anyone else had laughed contemptuously at Honeys forward conduct She saw Honeys awkward wigglings and heard her silly titters as she hung onto boys arms and the thought stung her to new rage rage at herself at Ashley at the world Because she hated herself she hated them all with the fury of the thwarted and humiliated love of sixteen Only a little true tenderness had been mixed into her love Mostly it had been compounded out of vanity and complacent confidence in her own charms Now she had lost and greater than her sense of loss was the fear that she had made a public spectacle of herself Had she been as obvious as Honey Was everyone laughing at her She began to shake at the thought Her hand dropped to a little table beside her fingering a tiny china rosebowl on which two china cherubs smirked The room was so still she almost screamed to break the silence She must do something or go mad She picked up the bowl and hurled it viciously across the room toward the fireplace It barely cleared the tall back of the sofa and splintered with a little crash against the marble mantelpiece This said a voice from the depths of the sofa is too much Nothing had ever startled or frightened her so much and her mouth went too dry for her to utter a sound She caught hold of the back of the chair her knees going weak under her as Rhett Butler rose from the sofa where he had been lying and made her a bow of exaggerated politeness It is bad enough to have an afternoon nap disturbed by such a passage as Ive been forced to hear but why should my life be endangered He was real He wasnt a ghost But saints preserve us he had heard everything She rallied her forces into a semblance of dignity Sir you should have made known your presence Indeed His white teeth gleamed and his bold dark eyes laughed at her But you were the intruder I was forced to wait for  Page    Gone With The Wind Mr Kennedy and feeling that I was perhaps persona non grata in the back yard I was thoughtful enough to remove my unwelcome presence here where I thought I would be undisturbed But alas he shrugged and laughed softly Her temper was beginning to rise again at the thought that this rude and impertinent man had heard everythingheard things she now wished she had died before she ever uttered Eavesdroppers she began furiously Eavesdroppers often hear highly entertaining and instructive things he grinned From a long experience in eavesdropping I Sir she said you are no gentleman An apt observation he answered airily And you Miss are no lady He seemed to find her very amusing for he laughed softly again No one can remain a lady after saying and doing what I have just overheard However ladies have seldom held any charms for me I know what they are thinking but they never have the courage or lack of breeding to say what they think And that in time becomes a bore But you my dear Miss OHara are a girl of rare spirit very admirable spirit and I take off my hat to you I fail to understand what charms the elegant Mr Wilkes can hold for a girl of your tempestuous nature He should thank God on bended knee for a girl with yourhow did he put itpassion for living but being a poorspirited wretch You arent fit to wipe his boots she shouted in rage And you were going to hate him all your life He sank down on the sofa and she heard him laughing If she could have killed him she would have done it Instead she walked out of the room with such dignity as she could summon and banged the heavy door behind her She went up the stairs so swiftly that when she reached the landing she thought she was going to faint She stopped clutching the banisters her heart hammering so hard from anger insult and exertion that it seemed about to burst through her basque She tried to draw deep breaths but Mammys lacings were too tight If she should faint and they should find her here on the landing what would they think Oh theyd think everything Ashley and that vile Butler man and those nasty girls who were so jealous For once in her life she wished that she carried smelling salts like the other girls but she had never even owned a vinaigrette She had always been so proud of never feeling giddy She simply could not let herself faint now Gradually the sickening feeling began to depart In a minute shed feel all right and then shed slip quietly into the little dressing room adjoining Indias room unloose her stays and creep in and lay herself on one of the beds beside the sleeping girls She tried to quiet her heart and fix her face into more composed lines for she knew she must look like a crazy woman If any of the girls were awake theyd know something was wrong And no one must ever ever know that anything had happened Through the wide bay window on the lawn she could see the men still lounging in their chairs under the trees and in the shade of the arbor How she envied them How wonderful to be a man and never have to undergo miseries such as she had just passed through As she stood watching them hot eyed and dizzy she heard the rapid pounding of a horses hooves on the front drive the scattering of gravel and the sound of an excited voice calling a question to one of the negroes The gravel flew again and across her vision a man on horseback galloped over the green lawn toward the lazy group under the trees Some latecome guest but why did he ride his horse across the turf that was Indias pride She could not recognize him but as he flung himself from the saddle and clutched John Wilkes arm she could see that there was excitement in every line of him The crowd swarmed about him tall glasses and palmetto fans abandoned on tables and on the ground In spite of the distance she could hear the hubbub of voices questioning calling feel the feverpitch tenseness of the men Then above the confused sounds Stuart Tarletons voice rose in an exultant shout Yeeaayee as if he were on the hunting field And she heard for the first time without knowing it the Rebel yell As she watched the four Tarletons followed by the Fontaine boys broke from the group and began hurrying toward the stable yelling as they ran Jeems You Jeems Saddle the horses Somebodys house must have caught fire Scarlett thought But fire or no fire her job was to get herself back into the bedroom before she was discovered Her heart was quieter now and she tiptoed up the steps into the silent hall A heavy warm somnolence lay over the house as if it slept at ease like the girls until night when it would burst into its full beauty with music and candle flames Carefully she eased open the door of the dressing room and slipped in Her hand was behind her still holding the knob when Honey Wilkes voice low pitched almost in a whisper came to her through the crack of the opposite door leading into the bedroom I think Scarlett acted as fast as a girl could act today Scarlett felt her heart begin its mad racing again and she clutched her hand against it unconsciously as if she would squeeze it into submission Eavesdroppers often hear highly instructive things jibed a memory Should she slip out again Or make herself known and embarrass Honey as she deserved But the next voice made her pause A team of mules could not have dragged her away when she heard Melanies voice Oh Honey no Dont be unkind Shes just high spirited and vivacious I thought her most charming Oh thought Scarlett clawing her nails into her basque To have that mealymouthed little mess take up for me It was harder to bear than Honeys outandout cattiness Scarlett had never trusted any woman and had never credited any woman except her mother with motives other than selfish ones Melanie knew she had Ashley securely so she could well afford to show such a Christian spirit Scarlett felt it was just Melanies way of parading her conquest and getting credit for being sweet at the same time Scarlett had frequently used the same trick herself when discussing other girls with men and it had never failed to convince foolish males of her sweetness and unselfishness Well Miss said Honey tartly her voice rising you must be blind Hush Honey hissed the voice of Sally Munroe Theyll hear you all over the house Honey lowered her voice but went on Well you saw how she was carrying on with every man she could get hold ofeven Mr Kennedy and hes her own sisters beau I never saw the like And she certainly was going after Charles Honey giggled selfconsciously And you know Charles  Page    Gone With The Wind and I Are you really whispered voices excitedly Well dont tell anybody girlsnot yet There were more gigglings and the bed springs creaked as someone squeezed Honey Melanie murmured something about how happy she was that Honey would be her sister Well I wont be happy to have Scarlett for my sister because shes a fast piece if ever I saw one came the aggrieved voice of Hetty Tarleton But shes as good as engaged to Stuart Brent says she doesnt give a rap about him but of course Brents crazy about her too If you should ask me said Honey with mysterious importance theres only one person she does give a rap about And thats Ashley As the whisperings merged together violently questioning interrupting Scarlett felt herself go cold with fear and humiliation Honey was a fool a silly a simpleton about men but she had a feminine instinct about other women that Scarlett had underestimated The mortification and hurt pride that she had suffered in the library with Ashley and with Rhett Butler were pin pricks to this Men could be trusted to keep their mouths shut even men like Mr Butler but with Honey Wilkes giving tongue like a hound in the field the entire County would know about it before six oclock And Gerald had said only last night that he wouldnt be having the County laughing at his daughter And how they would all laugh now Clammy perspiration starting under her armpits began to creep down her ribs Melanies voice measured and peaceful a little reproving rose above the others Honey you know that isnt so And its so unkind It is too Melly and if you werent always so busy looking for the good in people that havent got any good in them youd see it And Im glad its so It serves her right All Scarlett OHara has ever done has been to stir up trouble and try to get other girls beaux You know mighty well she took Stuart from India and she didnt want him And today she tried to take Mr Kennedy and Ashley and Charles I must get home thought Scarlett I must get home If she could only be transferred by magic to Tara and to safety If she could only be with Ellen just to see her to hold onto her skirt to cry and pour out the whole story in her lap If she had to listen to another word shed rush in and pull out Honeys straggly pale hair in big handfuls and spit on Melanie Hamilton to show her just what she thought of her charity But shed already acted common enough today enough like white trashthat was where all her trouble lay She pressed her hands hard against her skirts so they would not rustle and backed out as stealthily as an animal Home she thought as she sped down the hall past the closed doors and still rooms I must go home She was already on the front porch when a new thought brought her up sharplyshe couldnt go home She couldnt run away She would have to see it through bear all the malice of the girls and her own humiliation and heartbreak To run away would only give them more ammunition She pounded her clenched fist against the tall white pillar beside her and she wished that she were Samson so that she could pull down all of Twelve Oaks and destroy every person in it Shed make them sorry Shed show them She didnt quite see how shed show them but shed do it all the same Shed hurt them worse than they hurt her For the moment Ashley as Ashley was forgotten He was not the tall drowsy boy she loved but part and parcel of the Wilkeses Twelve Oaks the Countyand she hated them all because they laughed Vanity was stronger than love at sixteen and there was no room in her hot heart now for anything but hate I wont go home she thought Ill stay here and Ill make them sorry And Ill never tell Mother No Ill never tell anybody She braced herself to go back into the house to reclimb the stairs and go into another bedroom As she turned she saw Charles coming into the house from the other end of the long hall When he saw her he hurried toward her His hair was tousled and his face near geranium with excitement Do you know whats happened he cried even before he reached her Have you heard Paul Wilson just rode over from Jonesboro with the news He paused breathless as he came up to her She said nothing and only stared at him Mr Lincoln has called for men soldiersI mean volunteersseventyfive thousand of them Mr Lincoln again Didnt men ever think about anything that really mattered Here was this fool expecting her to be excited about Mr Lincolns didoes when her heart was broken and her reputation as good as ruined Charles stared at her Her face was paper white and her narrow eyes blazing like emeralds He had never seen such fire in any girls face such a glow in anyones eyes Im so clumsy he said I should have told you more gently I forgot how delicate ladies are Im sorry Ive upset you so You dont feel faint do you Can I get you a glass of water No she said and managed a crooked smile Shall we go sit on the bench he asked taking her arm She nodded and he carefully handed her down the front steps and led her across the grass to the iron bench beneath the largest oak in the front yard How fragile and tender women are he thought the mere mention of war and harshness makes them faint The idea made him feel very masculine and he was doubly gentle as he seated her She looked so strangely and there was a wild beauty about her white face that set his heart leaping Could it be that she was distressed by the thought that he might go to the war No that was too conceited for belief But why did she look at him so oddly And why did her hands shake as they fingered her lace handkerchief And her thick sooty lashesthey were fluttering just like the eyes of girls in romances he had read fluttering with timidity and love He cleared his throat three times to speak and failed each time He dropped his eyes because her own green ones met his so piercingly almost as if she were not seeing him He has a lot of money she was thinking swiftly as a thought and a plan went through her brain And he hasnt any parents  Page    Gone With The Wind to bother me and he lives in Atlanta And if I married him right away it would show Ashley that I didnt care a rapthat I was only flirting with him And it would just kill Honey Shed never never catch another beau and everybodyd laugh fit to die at her And it would hurt Melanie because she loves Charles so much And it would hurt Stu and Brent She didnt quite know why she wanted to hurt them except that they had catty sisters And theyd all be sorry when I came back here to visit in a fine carriage and with lots of pretty clothes and a house of my own And they would never never laugh at me Of course it will mean fighting said Charles after several more embarrassed attempts But dont you fret Miss Scarlett itll be over in a month and well have them howling Yes sir Howling I wouldnt miss it for anything Im afraid there wont be much of a ball tonight because the Troop is going to meet at Jonesboro The Tarleton boys have gone to spread the news I know the ladies will be sorry She said Oh for want of anything better but it sufficed Coolness was beginning to come back to her and her mind was collecting itself A frost lay over all her emotions and she thought that she would never feel anything warmly again Why not take this pretty flushed boy He was as good as anyone else and she didnt care No she could never care about anything again not if she lived to be ninety I cant decide now whether to go with Mr Wade Hamptons South Carolina Legion or with the Atlanta Gate City Guard She said Oh again and their eyes met and the fluttering lashes were his undoing Will you wait for me Miss Scarlett Itit would be Heaven just knowing that you were waiting for me until after we licked them He hung breathless on her words watching the way her lips curled up at the corners noting for the first time the shadows about these corners and thinking what it would mean to kiss them Her hand with palm clammy with perspiration slid into his I wouldnt want to wait she said and her eyes were veiled He sat clutching her hand his mouth wide open Watching him from under her lashes Scarlett thought detachedly that he looked like a gigged frog He stuttered several times closed his mouth and opened it again and again became geranium colored Can you possibly love me She said nothing but looked down into her lap and Charles was thrown into new states of ecstasy and embarrassment Perhaps a man should not ask a girl such a question Perhaps it would be unmaidenly for her to answer it Having never possessed the courage to get himself into such a situation before Charles was at a loss as to how to act He wanted to shout and to sing and to kiss her and to caper about the lawn and then run tell everyone black and white that she loved him But he only squeezed her hand until he drove her rings into the flesh You will marry me soon Miss Scarlett Um she said fingering a fold of her dress Shall we make it a double wedding with Mel No she said quickly her eyes glinting up at him ominously Charles knew again that he had made an error Of course a girl wanted her own weddingnot shared glory How kind she was to overlook his blunderings If it were only dark and he had the courage of shadows and could kiss her hand and say the things he longed to say When may I speak to your father The sooner the better she said hoping that perhaps he would release the crushing pressure on her rings before she had to ask him to do it He leaped up and for a moment she thought he was going to cut a caper before dignity claimed him He looked down at her radiantly his whole clean simple heart in his eyes She had never had anyone look at her thus before and would never have it from any other man but in her queer detachment she only thought that he looked like a calf Ill go now and find your father he said smiling all over his face I cant wait Will you excuse medear The endearment came hard but having said it once he repeated it again with pleasure Yes she said Ill wait here Its so cool and nice here He went off across the lawn and disappeared around the house and she was alone under the rustling oak From the stables men were streaming out on horseback negro servants riding hard behind their masters The Munroe boys tore past waving their hats and the Fontaines and Calverts went down the road yelling The four Tarletons charged across the lawn by her and Brent shouted Mothers going to give us the horses Yeeaayee Turf flew and they were gone leaving her alone again The white house reared its tall columns before her seeming to withdraw with dignified aloofness from her It would never be her house now Ashley would never carry her over the threshold as his bride Oh Ashley Ashley What have I done Deep in her under layers of hurt pride and cold practicality something stirred hurtingly An adult emotion was being born stronger than her vanity or her willful selfishness She loved Ashley and she knew she loved him and she had never cared so much as in that instant when she saw Charles disappearing around the curved graveled walk CHAPTER VII WITHIN TWO WEEKS Scarlett had become a wife and within two months more she was a widow She was soon released from the bonds she had assumed with so much haste and so little thought but she was never again to know the careless freedom of her unmarried days Widowhood had crowded closely on the heels of marriage but to her dismay motherhood soon followed In after years when she thought of those last days of April  Scarlett could never quite remember details Time and events were telescoped jumbled together like a nightmare that had no reality or reason Till the day she died there would be blank spots in her memories of those days Especially vague were her recollections of the time between her acceptance of Charles and her wedding Two weeks So short an engagement would have been impossible in times of peace Then there would have been a dec orous interval of a year or at least six months But the South was aflame with war events roared along as swiftly as if carried by a mighty wind and the slow tempo of the old days was gone Ellen had wrung her hands and counseled delay in order that Scarlett might think the matter over at greater length But to her pleadings Scarlett turned a sullen face and a deaf ear Marry she would and quickly too Within two weeks  Page    Gone With The Wind Learning that Ashleys wedding had been moved up from the autumn to the first of May so he could leave with the Troop as soon as it was called into service Scarlett set the date of her wedding for the day before his Ellen protested but Charles pleaded with newfound eloquence for he was impatient to be off to South Carolina to join Wade Hamptons Legion and Gerald sided with the two young people He was excited by the war fever and pleased that Scarlett had made so good a match and who was he to stand in the way of young love when there was a war Ellen distracted finally gave in as other mothers throughout the South were doing Their leisured world had been turned topsyturvy and their pleadings prayers and advice availed nothing against the powerful forces sweeping them along The South was intoxicated with enthusiasm and excitement Everyone knew that one battle would end the war and every young man hastened to enlist before the war should endhastened to marry his sweetheart before he rushed off to Virginia to strike a blow at the Yankees There were dozens of war weddings in the County and there was little time for the sorrow of parting for everyone was too busy and excited for either solemn thoughts or tears The ladies were making uniforms knitting socks and rolling bandages and the men were drilling and shooting Train loads of troops passed through Jonesboro daily on their way north to Atlanta and Virginia Some detachments were gaily uniformed in the scarlets and light blues and greens of select socialmilitia companies some small groups were in homespun and coonskin caps others ununiformed were in broadcloth and fine linen all were halfdrilled halfarmed wild with excitement and shouting as though en route to a picnic The sight of these men threw the County boys into a panic for fear the war would be over before they could reach Virginia and preparations for the Troops departure were speeded In the midst of this turmoil preparations went forward for Scarletts wedding and almost before she knew it she was clad in Ellens wedding dress and veil coming down the wide stairs of Tara on her fathers arm to face a house packed full with guests Afterward she remembered as from a dream the hundreds of candles flaring on the walls her mothers face loving a little bewildered her lips moving in a silent prayer for her daughters happiness Gerald flushed with brandy and pride that his daughter was marrying both money a fine name and an old oneand Ashley standing at the bottom of the steps with Melanies arm through his When she saw the look on his face she thought This cant be real It cant be Its a nightmare Ill wake up and find its all been a nightmare I mustnt think of it now or Ill begin screaming in front of all these people I cant think now Ill think later when I can stand itwhen I cant see his eyes It was all very dreamlike the passage through the aisle of smiling people Charles scarlet face and stammering voice and her own replies so startlingly clear so cold And the congratulations afterward and the kissing and the toasts and the dancingall all like a dream Even the feel of Ashleys kiss upon her cheek even Melanies soft whisper Now were really and truly sisters were unreal Even the excitement caused by the swooning spell that overtook Charles plump emotional aunt Miss Pittypat Hamilton had the quality of a nightmare But when the dancing and toasting were finally ended and the dawn was coming when all the Atlanta guests who could be crowded into Tara and the overseers house had gone to sleep on beds sofas and pallets on the floor and all the neighbors had gone home to rest in preparation for the wedding at Twelve Oaks the next day then the dreamlike trance shattered like crystal before reality The reality was the blushing Charles emerging from her dressing room in his nightshirt avoiding the startled look she gave him over the highpulled sheet Of course she knew that married people occupied the same bed but she had never given the matter a thought before It seemed very natural in the case of her mother and father but she had never applied it to herself Now for the first time since the barbecue she realized just what she had brought on herself The thought of this strange boy whom she hadnt really wanted to marry getting into bed with her when her heart was breaking with an agony of regret at her hasty action and the anguish of losing Ashley forever was too much to be borne As he hesitatingly approached the bed she spoke in a hoarse whisper Ill scream out loud if you come near me I will I willat the top of my voice Get away from me Dont you dare touch me So Charles Hamilton spent his wedding night in an armchair in the corner not too unhappily for he understood or thought he understood the modesty and delicacy of his bride He was willing to wait until her fears subsided onlyonly He sighed as he twisted about seeking a comfortable position for he was going away to the war so very soon Nightmarish as her own wedding had been Ashleys wedding was even worse Scarlett stood in her applegreen secondday dress in the parlor of Twelve Oaks amid the blaze of hundreds of candles jostled by the same throng as the night before and saw the plain little face of Melanie Hamilton glow into beauty as she became Melanie Wilkes Now Ashley was gone forever Her Ashley No not her Ashley now Had he ever been hers It was all so mixed up in her mind and her mind was so tired so bewil dered He had said he loved her but what was it that had separated them If she could only remember She had stilled the Countys gossiping tongue by marrying Charles but what did that matter now It had seemed so important once but now it didnt seem important at all All that mattered was Ashley Now he was gone and she was married to a man she not only did not love but for whom she had an active contempt Oh how she regretted it all She had often heard of people cutting off their noses to spite their faces but heretofore it had been only a figure of speech Now she knew just what it meant And mingled with her frenzied desire to be free of Charles and safely back at Tara an unmarried girl again ran the knowledge that she had only herself to blame Ellen had tried to stop her and she would not listen So she danced through the night of Ashleys wedding in a daze and said things mechanically and smiled and irrelevantly wondered at the stupidity of people who thought her a happy bride and could not see that her heart was broken Well thank God they couldnt see That night after Mammy had helped her undress and had departed and Charles had emerged shyly from the dressing room wondering if he was to spend a second night in the horsehair chair she burst into tears She cried until Charles climbed into bed beside her and tried to comfort her cried without words until no more tears would come and at last she lay sobbing quietly on his shoulder If there had not been a war there would have been a week of visiting about the County with balls and barbecues in honor of the  Page    Gone With The Wind two newly married couples before they set off to Saratoga or White Sulphur for wedding trips If there had not been a war Scarlett would have had thirdday and fourthday and fifthday dresses to wear to the Fontaine and Calvert and Tarleton parties in her honor But there were no parties now and no wedding trips A week after the wedding Charles left to join Colonel Wade Hampton and two weeks later Ashley and the Troop departed leaving the whole County bereft In those two weeks Scarlett never saw Ashley alone never had a private word with him Not even at the terrible moment of parting when he stopped by Tara on his way to the train did she have a private talk Melanie bonneted and shawled sedate in newly acquired matronly dignity hung on his arm and the entire personnel of Tara black and white turned out to see Ashley off to the war Melanie said You must kiss Scarlett Ashley Shes my sister now and Ashley bent and touched her cheek with cold lips his face drawn and taut Scarlett could hardly take any joy from that kiss so sullen was her heart at Mellys prompting it Melanie smothered her with an embrace at parting You will come to Atlanta and visit me and Aunt Pittypat wont you Oh darling we want to have you so much We want to know Charlies wife better Five weeks passed during which letters shy ecstatic loving came from Charles in South Carolina telling of his love his plans for the future when the war was over his desire to become a hero for her sake and his worship of his commander Wade Hampton In the seventh week there came a telegram from Colonel Hampton himself and then a letter a kind dignified letter of condolence Charles was dead The colonel would have wired earlier but Charles thinking his illness a trifling one did not wish to have his family worried The unfortunate boy had not only been cheated of the love he thought he had won but also of his high hopes of honor and glory on the field of battle He had died ignominiously and swiftly of pneumonia following measles without ever having gotten any closer to the Yankees than the camp in South Carolina In due time Charles son was born and because it was fashionable to name boys after their fathers commanding officers he was called Wade Hampton Hamilton Scarlett had wept with despair at the knowledge that she was pregnant and wished that she were dead But she carried the child through its time with a minimum of discomfort bore him with little distress and recovered so quickly that Mammy told her privately it was downright commonladies should suffer more She felt little affection for the child hide the fact though she might She had not wanted him and she resented his coming and now that he was here it did not seem possible that he was hers a part of her Though she recovered physically from Wades birth in a disgracefully short time mentally she was dazed and sick Her spirits drooped despite the efforts of the whole plantation to revive them Ellen went about with a puckered worried forehead and Gerald swore more frequently than usual and brought her useless gifts from Jonesboro Even old Dr Fontaine admitted that he was puzzled after his tonic of sulphur molasses and herbs failed to perk her up He told Ellen privately that it was a broken heart that made Scarlett so irritable and listless by turns But Scarlett had she wished to speak could have told them that it was a far different and more complex trouble She did not tell them that it was utter boredom bewilderment at actually being a mother and most of all the absence of Ashley that made her look so woebegone Her boredom was acute and ever present The County had been devoid of any entertainment or social life ever since the Troop had gone away to war All of the interesting young men were gonethe four Tarletons the two Calverts the Fontaines the Munroes and everyone from Jonesboro Fayetteville and Lovejoy who was young and attractive Only the older men the cripples and the women were left and they spent their time knitting and sewing growing more cotton and corn raising more hogs and sheep and cows for the army There was never a sight of a real man except when the commissary troop under Suellens middleaged beau Frank Kennedy rode by every month to collect supplies The men in the commissary were not very exciting and the sight of Franks timid courting annoyed her until she found it difficult to be polite to him If he and Suellen would only get it over with Even if the commissary troop had been more interesting it would not have helped her situation any She was a widow and her heart was in the grave At least everyone thought it was in the grave and expected her to act accordingly This irritated her for try as she would she could recall nothing about Charles except the dyingcalf look on his face when she told him she would marry him And even that picture was fading But she was a widow and she had to watch her behavior Not for her the pleasures of unmarried girls She had to be grave and aloof Ellen had stressed this at great length after catching Franks lieutenant swinging Scarlett in the garden swing and making her squeal with laughter Deeply distressed Ellen had told her how easily a widow might get herself talked about The conduct of a widow must be twice as circumspect as that of a matron And God only knows thought Scarlett listening obediently to her mothers soft voice matrons never have any fun at all So widows might as well be dead A widow had to wear hideous black dresses without even a touch of braid to enliven them no flower or ribbon or lace or even jewelry except onyx mourning brooches or necklaces made from the deceaseds hair And the black crpe veil on her bonnet had to reach to her knees and only after three years of widowhood could it be shortened to shoulder length Widows could never chatter vivaciously or laugh aloud Even when they smiled it must be a sad tragic smile And most dreadful of all they could in no way indicate an interest in the company of gentlemen And should a gentleman be so ill bred as to indicate an interest in her she must freeze him with a dignified but wellchosen reference to her dead husband Oh yes thought Scarlett drearily some widows do remarry eventually when they are old and stringy Though Heaven knows how they manage it with their neighbors watching And then its generally to some desperate old widower with a large plantation and a dozen children Marriage was bad enough but to be widowedoh then life was over forever How stupid people were when they talked about what a comfort little Wade Hampton must be to her now that Charles was gone How stupid of them to say that now she had something to live for Everyone talked about how sweet it was that she had this posthumous token of her love and she naturally did not disabuse their minds But that thought was farthest from her mind She had very little interest in Wade and sometimes it was difficult to remember that he was actually hers Every morning she woke up and for a drowsy moment she was Scarlett OHara again and the sun was bright in the magnolia outside her window and the mockers were singing and the sweet smell of frying bacon was stealing to her nostrils She was  Page    Gone With The Wind carefree and young again Then she heard the fretful hungry wail and alwaysalways there was a startled moment when she thought Why theres a baby in the house Then she remembered that it was her baby It was all very bewildering And Ashley Oh most of all Ashley For the first time in her life she hated Tara hated the long red road that led down the hill to the river hated the red fields with springing green cotton Every foot of ground every tree and brook every lane and bridle path reminded her of him He belonged to another woman and he had gone to the war but his ghost still haunted the roads in the twilight still smiled at her from drowsy gray eyes in the shadows of the porch She never heard the sound of hooves coming up the river road from Twelve Oaks that for a sweet moment she did not thinkAshley She hated Twelve Oaks now and once she had loved it She hated it but she was drawn there so she could hear John Wilkes and the girls talk about himhear them read his letters from Virginia They hurt her but she had to hear them She disliked the stiffnecked India and the foolish prattling Honey and knew they disliked her equally but she could not stay away from them And every time she came home from Twelve Oaks she lay down on her bed morosely and refused to get up for supper It was this refusal of food that worried Ellen and Mammy more than anything else Mammy brought up tempting trays insinuating that now she was a widow she might eat as much as she pleased but Scarlett had no appetite When Dr Fontaine told Ellen gravely that heartbreak frequently led to a decline and women pined away into the grave Ellen went white for that fear was what she had carried in her heart Isnt there anything to be done Doctor A change of scene will be the best thing in the world for her said the doctor only too anxious to be rid of an unsatisfactory patient So Scarlett unenthusiastic went off with her child first to visit her OHara and Robillard relatives in Savannah and then to Ellens sisters Pauline and Eulalie in Charleston But she was back at Tara a month before Ellen expected her with no explanation of her return They had been kind in Savannah but James and Andrew and their wives were old and content to sit quietly and talk of a past in which Scarlett had no interest It was the same with the Robillards and Charleston was terrible Scarlett thought Aunt Pauline and her husband a little old man with a formal brittle courtesy and the absent air of one living in an older age lived on a plantation on the river far more isolated than Tara Their nearest neighbor was twenty miles away by dark roads through still jungles of cypress swamp and oak The live oaks with their waving curtains of gray moss gave Scarlett the creeps and always brought to her mind Geralds stories of Irish ghosts roaming in shimmering gray mists There was nothing to do but knit all day and at night listen to Uncle Carey read aloud from the improving works of Mr BulwerLytton Eulalie hidden behind a highwalled garden in a great house on the Battery in Charleston was no more entertaining Scarlett accustomed to wide vistas of rolling red hills felt that she was in prison There was more social life here than at Aunt Paulines but Scarlett did not like the people who called with their airs and their traditions and their emphasis on family She knew very well they all thought she was a child of a msalliance and wondered how a Robillard ever married a newly come Irishman Scarlett felt that Aunt Eulalie apologized for her behind her back This aroused her temper for she cared no more about family than her father She was proud of Gerald and what he had accomplished unaided except by his shrewd Irish brain And the Charlestonians took so much upon themselves about Fort Sumter Good Heavens didnt they realize that if they hadnt been silly enough to fire the shot that started the war some other fools would have done it Accustomed to the brisk voices of upland Georgia the drawling flat voices of the low country seemed affected to her She thought if she ever again heard voices that said paams for palms and hoose for house and woont for wont and Maa and Paa for Ma and Pa she would scream It irritated her so much that during one formal call she aped Geralds brogue to her aunts distress Then she went back to Tara Better to be tormented with memories of Ashley than Charleston accents Ellen busy night and day doubling the productiveness of Tara to aid the Confederacy was terrified when her eldest daughter came home from Charleston thin white and sharp tongued She had known heartbreak herself and night after night she lay beside the snoring Gerald trying to think of some way to lessen Scarletts distress Charles aunt Miss Pittypat Hamilton had written her several times urging her to permit Scarlett to come to Atlanta for a long visit and now for the first time Ellen considered it seriously She and Melanie were alone in a big house and without male protection wrote Miss Pittypat now that dear Charlie has gone Of course there is my brother Henry but he does not make his home with us But perhaps Scarlett has told you of Henry Delicacy forbids my putting more concerning him on paper Melly and I would feel so much easier and safer if Scarlett were with us Three lonely women are better than two And perhaps dear Scarlett could find some ease for her sorrow as Melly is doing by nursing our brave boys in the hospitals hereand of course Melly and I are longing to see the dear baby  So Scarletts trunk was packed again with her mourning clothes and off she went to Atlanta with Wade Hampton and his nurse Prissy a headful of admonitions as to her conduct from Ellen and Mammy and a hundred dollars in Confederate bills from Gerald She did not especially want to go to Atlanta She thought Aunt Pitty the silliest of old ladies and the very idea of living under the same roof with Ashleys wife was abhorrent But the County with its memories was impossible now and any change was wel come Part Two CHAPTER VIII AS THE TRAIN carried Scarlett northward that May morning in  she thought that Atlanta couldnt possibly be so boring as Charleston and Savannah had been and in spite of her distaste for Miss Pittypat and Melanie she looked forward with some curiosity toward seeing how the town had fared since her last visit in the winter before the war began Atlanta had always interested her more than any other town because when she was a child Gerald had told her that she and Atlanta were exactly the same age She discovered when she grew older that Gerald had stretched the truth somewhat as was his habit when a little stretching would improve a story but Atlanta was only nine years older than she was and that still left the  Page    Gone With The Wind place amazingly young by comparison with any other town she had ever heard of Savannah and Charleston had the dignity of their years one being well along in its second century and the other entering its third and in her young eyes they had always seemed like aged grandmothers fanning themselves placidly in the sun But Atlanta was of her own generation crude with the crudities of youth and as headstrong and impetuous as herself The story Gerald had told her was based on the fact that she and Atlanta were christened in the same year In the nine years before Scarlett was born the town had been called first Terminus and then Marthasville and not until the year of Scarletts birth had it become Atlanta When Gerald first moved to north Georgia there had been no Atlanta at all not even the semblance of a village and wilderness rolled over the site But the next year in  the State had authorized the building of a railroad northwestward through the territory which the Cherokees had recently ceded The destination of the proposed railroad Tennessee and the West was clear and definite but its beginning point in Georgia was somewhat uncertain until a year later an engineer drove a stake in the red clay to mark the southern end of the line and Atlanta born Terminus had begun There were no railroads then in north Georgia and very few anywhere else But during the years before Gerald married Ellen the tiny settlement twentyfive miles north of Tara slowly grew into a village and the tracks slowly pushed northward Then the railroad building era really began From the old city of Augusta a second railroad was extended westward across the state to connect with the new road to Tennessee From the old city of Savannah a third railroad was built first to Macon in the heart of Georgia and then north through Geralds own county to Atlanta to link up with the other two roads and give Savannahs harbor a highway to the West From the same junction point the young Atlanta a fourth railroad was constructed southwestward to Montgomery and Mobile Born of a railroad Atlanta grew as its railroads grew With the completion of the four lines Atlanta was now connected with the West with the South with the Coast and through Augusta with the North and East It had become the crossroads of travel north and south and east and west and the little village leaped to life In a space of time but little longer than Scarletts seventeen years Atlanta had grown from a single stake driven in the ground into a thriving small city of ten thousand that was the center of attention for the whole state The older quieter cities were wont to look upon the bustling new town with the sensations of a hen which has hatched a duckling Why was the place so different from the other Georgia towns Why did it grow so fast After all they thought it had nothing whatever to recommend itonly its railroads and a bunch of mighty pushy people The people who settled the town called successively Terminus Marthasville and Atlanta were a pushy people Restless energetic people from the older sections of Georgia and from more distant states were drawn to this town that sprawled itself around the junction of the railroads in its center They came with enthusiasm They built their stores around the five muddy red roads that crossed near the depot They built their fine homes on Whitehall and Washington streets and along the high ridge of land on which countless generations of moccasined Indian feet had beaten a path called the Peachtree Trail They were proud of the place proud of its growth proud of themselves for making it grow Let the older towns call Atlanta anything they pleased Atlanta did not care Scarlett had always liked Atlanta for the very same reasons that made Savannah Augusta and Macon condemn it Like herself the town was a mixture of the old and new in Georgia in which the old often came off second best in its conflicts with the selfwilled and vigorous new Moreover there was something personal exciting about a town that was bornor at least christenedthe same year she was christened The night before had been wild and wet with rain but when Scarlett arrived in Atlanta a warm sun was at work bravely attempting to dry the streets that were winding rivers of red mud In the open space around the depot the soft ground had been cut and churned by the constant flow of traffic in and out until it resembled an enormous hog wallow and here and there vehicles were mired to the hubs in the ruts A neverceasing line of army wagons and ambulances loading and unloading supplies and wounded from the trains made the mud and confusion worse as they toiled in and struggled out drivers swearing mules plunging and mud spattering for yards Scarlett stood on the lower step of the train a pale pretty figure in her black mourning dress her crpe veil fluttering almost to her heels She hesitated unwilling to soil her slippers and hems and looked about in the shouting tangle of wagons buggies and carriages for Miss Pittypat There was no sign of that chubby pinkcheeked lady but as Scarlett searched anxiously a spare old negro with grizzled kinks and an air of dignified authority came toward her through the mud his hat in his hand Dis Miss Scarlett ain it Dis hyah Peter Miss Pittys coachman Doan step down in dat mud he ordered severely as Scarlett gathered up her skirts preparatory to descending You is as bad as Miss Pitty an she lak a chile bout gittin her feets wet Lemme cahy you He picked Scarlett up with ease despite his apparent frailness and age and observing Prissy standing on the platform of the train the baby in her arms he paused Is dat air chile yo nuss Miss Scarlett she too young ter be handlin Mist Charles onlies baby But we ten to dat later You gal foller me an doan you go drappin dat baby Scarlett submitted meekly to being carried toward the carriage and also to the peremptory manner in which Uncle Peter criticized her and Prissy As they went through the mud with Prissy sloshing pouting after them she recalled what Charles had said about Uncle Peter He went through all the Mexican campaigns with Father nursed him when he was woundedin fact he saved his life Uncle Peter practically raised Melanie and me for we were very young when Father and Mother died Aunt Pitty had a falling out with her brother Uncle Henry about that time so she came to live with us and take care of us She is the most helpless souljust like a sweet grownup child and Uncle Peter treats her that way To save her life she couldnt make up her mind about anything so Peter makes it up for her He was the one who decided I should have a larger allowance when I was fifteen and he insisted that I should go to Harvard for my senior year when Uncle Henry wanted me to take my degree at the University And he decided when Melly was old enough to put up her hair and go to parties He tells Aunt Pitty when its too cold or too wet for her to go call  Page    Gone With The Wind ing and when she should wear a shawl  Hes the smartest old darky Ive ever seen and about the most devoted The only trouble with him is that he owns the three of us body and soul and he knows it Charles words were confirmed as Peter climbed onto the box and took the whip Miss Pitty in a state bekase she din come ter meet you Shes feared you mout not unnerstan but Ah tole her she an Miss Melly jes git splashed wid mud an ruin dey new dresses an Ahd splain ter you Miss Scarlett you better tek dat chile Dat lil pickaninny gwine let it drap Scarlett looked at Prissy and sighed Prissy was not the most adequate of nurses Her recent graduation from a skinny pickaninny with brief skirts and stiffly wrapped braids into the dignity of a calico dress and starched white turban was an intoxicating affair She would never have arrived at this eminence so early in life had not the exigencies of war and the demands of the commissary department on Tara made it impossible for Ellen to spare Mammy or Dilcey or even Rosa or Teena Prissy had never been more than a mile away from Twelve Oaks or Tara before and the trip on the train plus her elevation to nurse was almost more than the brain in her little black skull could bear The twentymile journey from Jonesboro to Atlanta had so excited her that Scarlett had been forced to hold the baby all the way Now the sight of so many buildings and people completed Prissys demoralization She twisted from side to side pointed bounced about and so jounced the baby that he wailed miserably Scarlett longed for the fat old arms of Mammy Mammy had only to lay hands on a child and it hushed crying But Mammy was at Tara and there was nothing Scarlett could do It was useless for her to take little Wade from Prissy He yelled just as loudly when she held him as when Prissy did Besides he would tug at the ribbons of her bonnet and no doubt rumple her dress So she pretended she had not heard Uncle Peters suggestion Maybe Ill learn about babies sometime she thought irritably as the carriage jolted and swayed out of the morass surrounding the station but Im never going to like fooling with them And as Wades face went purple with his squalling she snapped crossly Give him that sugartit in your pocket Priss Anything to make him hush I know hes hungry but I cant do anything about that now Prissy produced the sugartit given her that morning by Mammy and the babys wails subsided With quiet restored and with the new sights that met her eyes Scarletts spirits began to rise a little When Uncle Peter finally maneuvered the carriage out of the mudholes and onto Peachtree Street she felt the first surge of interest she had known in months How the town had grown It was not much more than a year since she had last been here and it did not seem possible that the little Atlanta she knew could have changed so much For the past year she had been so engrossed in her own woes so bored by any mention of war she did not know that from the minute the fighting first began Atlanta had been transformed The same railroads which had made the town the crossroads of commerce in time of peace were now of vital strategic importance in time of war Far from the battle lines the town and its railroads provided the connecting link between the two armies of the Confederacy the army in Virginia and the army in Tennessee and the West And Atlanta likewise linked both of the armies with the deeper South from which they drew their supplies Now in response to the needs of war Atlanta had become a manufacturing center a hospital base and one of the Souths chief depots for the collecting of food and supplies for the armies in the field Scarlett looked about her for the little town she remembered so well It was gone The town she was now seeing was like a baby grown overnight into a busy sprawling giant Atlanta was humming like a beehive proudly conscious of its importance to the Confederacy and work was going forward night and day toward turning an agricultural section into an industrial one Before the war there had been few cotton factories woolen mills arsenals and machine shops south of Marylanda fact of which all Southerners were proud The South produced statesmen and soldiers planters and doctors lawyers and poets but certainly not engineers or mechanics Let the Yankees adopt such low callings But now the Confederate ports were stoppered with Yankee gunboats only a trickle of blockaderun goods was slipping in from Europe and the South was desperately trying to manufacture her own war materials The North could call on the whole world for supplies and for soldiers and thousands of Irish and Germans were pouring into the Union Army lured by the bounty money offered by the North The South could only turn in upon itself In Atlanta there were machine factories tediously turning out machinery to manufacture war materialstediously because there were few machines in the South from which they could model and nearly every wheel and cog had to be made from drawings that came through the blockade from England There were strange faces on the streets of Atlanta now and citizens who a year ago would have pricked op their ears at the sound of even a Western accent paid no heed to the foreign tongues of Europeans who had run the blockade to build machines and turn out Confederate munitions Skilled men these without whom the Confederacy would have been hard put to make pistols rifles cannon and powder Almost the poising of the towns heart could be felt as the work went forward night and day pumping the materials of war up the railway arteries to the two battle fronts Trains roared in and out of the town at all hours Soot from the newly erected factories fell in showers on the white houses By night the furnaces glowed and the hammers clanged long after townsfolk were abed Where vacant lots had been a year before there were now factories turning out harness saddles and shoes ordnancesupply plants making rifles and cannon rolling mills and foundries producing iron rails and freight cars to replace those destroyed by the Yankees and a variety of industries manufacturing spurs bridle bits buckles tents buttons pistols and swords Already the foundries were beginning to feel the lack of iron for little or none came through the blockade and the mines in Alabama were standing almost idle while the miners were at the front There were no iron picket fences iron summerhouses iron gates or even iron statuary on the lawns of Atlanta now for they had early found their way into the melting pots of the rolling mills Here along Peachtree Street and nearby streets were the headquarters of the various army departments each office swarming with uniformed men the commissary the signal corps the mail service the railway transport the provost marshal On the outskirts of town were the remount depots where horses and mules milled about in large corrals and along side streets were the hospitals As Uncle Peter told her about them Scarlet felt that Atlanta must be a city of the wounded for there were general hospitals contagious hospitals convalescent hospitals without number And every day the trains just below Five Points disgorged more sick and more wounded  Page    Gone With The Wind The little town was gone and the face of the rapidly growing city was animated with neverceasing energy and bustle The sight of so much hurrying made Scarlett fresh from rural leisure and quiet almost breathless but she liked it There was an exciting atmosphere about the place that uplifted her It was as if she could actually feel the accelerated steady pulse of the towns heart beating in time with her own As they slowly made their way through the mudholes of the towns chief street she noted with interest all the new buildings and the new faces The sidewalks were crowded with men in uniform bearing the insignia of all ranks and all service branches the narrow street was jammed with vehiclescarriages buggies ambulances covered army wagons with profane drivers swearing as the mules struggled through the ruts grayclad couriers dashed spattering through the streets from one headquarters to another bearing orders and telegraphic dispatches convalescents limped about on crutches usually with a solicitous lady at either elbow bugle and drum and barked orders sounded from the drill fields where the recruits were being turned into soldiers and with her heart in her throat Scarlett had her first sight of Yankee uniforms as Uncle Peter pointed with his whip to a detachment of dejectedlooking bluecoats being shepherded toward the depot by a squad of Confederates with fixed bayonets to entrain for the prison camp Oh thought Scarlett with the first feeling of real pleasure she had experienced since the day of the barbecue Im going to like it here Its so alive and exciting The town was even more alive than she realized for there were new barrooms by the dozens prostitutes following the army swarmed the town and bawdy houses were blossoming with women to the consternation of the church people Every hotel boarding house and private residence was crammed with visitors who had come to be near wounded relatives in the big Atlanta hospitals There were parties and balls and bazaars every week and war weddings without number with the grooms on furlough in bright gray and gold braid and the brides in blockaderun finery aisles of crossed swords toasts drunk in blockaded champagne and tearful farewells Nightly the dark treelined streets resounded with dancing feet and from parlors tinkled pianos where soprano voices blended with those of soldier guests in the pleasing melancholy of The Bugles Sang Truce and Your Letter Came but Came Too Lateplaintive ballads that brought exciting tears to soft eyes which had never known the tears of real grief As they progressed down the street through the sucking mud Scarlett bubbled over with questions and Peter answered them pointing here and there with his whip proud to display his knowledge Dat air de arsenal Yasm dey keeps guns an sech lak dar Nom dem air ain stos deys blockade awfisses Law Miss Scarlett doan you know whut blockade awfisses is Deys awfisses whar furriners stays dat buy us Confedruts cotton an ship it outer Chaston and Wilminton an ship us back gunpowder Nom

Dars Miss Merriwether an Miss Elsing abowin to you Scarlett vaguely remembered two ladies of those names who came from Atlanta to Tara to attend her wedding and she remembered that they were Miss Pittypats best friends So she turned quickly where Uncle Peter pointed and bowed The two were sitting in a carriage outside a drygoods store The proprietor and two clerks stood on the sidewalk with armfuls of bolts of cotton cloth they had been displaying Mrs Merriwether was a tall stout woman and so tightly corseted that her bust jutted for ward like the prow of a ship Her irongray hair was eked out by a curled false fringe that was proudly brown and disdained to match the rest of her hair She had a round highly colored face in which was combined goodnatured shrewdness and the habit of command Mrs Elsing was younger a thin frail woman who had been a beauty and about her there still clung a faded freshness a dainty imperious air These two ladies with a third Mrs Whiting were the pillars of Atlanta They ran the three churches to which they belonged the clergy the choirs and the parishioners They organized bazaars and presided over sewing circles they chaperoned balls and picnics they knew who made good matches and who did not who drank secretly who were to have babies and when They were authorities on the genealogies of everyone who was anyone in Georgia South Carolina and Virginia and did not bother their heads about the other states because they believed that no one who was anybody ever came from states other than these three They knew what was decorous behavior and what was not and they never failed to make their opinions knownMrs Merriwether at the top of her voice Mrs Elsing in an elegant dieaway drawl and Mrs Whiting in a distressed whisper which showed how much she hated to speak of such things These three ladies disliked and distrusted one another as heartily as the First Triumvirate of Rome and their close alliance was probably for the same reason I told Pitty I had to have you in my hospital called Mrs Merriwether smiling Dont you go promising Mrs Meade or Mrs Whiting I wont said Scarlett having no idea what Mrs Merriwether was talking about but feeling a glow of warmth at being welcomed and wanted I hope to see you again soon The carriage plowed its way farther and halted for a moment to permit two ladies with baskets of bandages on their arms to pick precarious passages across the sloppy street on stepping stones At the same moment Scarletts eye was caught by a figure on the sidewalk in a brightly colored dresstoo bright for street wearcovered by a Paisley shawl with fringes to the heels Turning she saw a tall handsome woman with a bold face and a mass of red hair too red to be true It was the first time she had ever seen any woman who she knew for certain had done something to her hair and she watched her fascinated Uncle Peter who is that she whispered Ah doan know You do too I can tell Who is she Her name Belle Watling said Uncle Peter his lower lip beginning to protrude Scarlett was quick to catch the fact that he had not preceded the name with Miss or Mrs Who is she  Page    Gone With The Wind Miss Scarlett said Peter darkly laying the whip on the startled horse Miss Pitty ain gwine ter lak it you astin questions dat ain none of yo bizness Days a passel of nocount folks in dis town now dat it ain no use talkin about Good Heavens thought Scarlett reproved into silence That must be a bad woman She had never seen a bad woman before and she twisted her head and stared after her until she was lost in the crowd The stores and the new war buildings were farther apart now with vacant lots between Finally the business section fell behind and the residences came into view Scarlett picked them out as old friends the Leyden house dignified and stately the Bonnells with little white columns and green blinds the closelipped redbrick Georgian home of the McLure family behind its low box hedges Their progress was slower now for from porches and gardens and sidewalks ladies called to her Some she knew slightly others she vaguely remembered but most of them she knew not at all Pittypat had certainly broadcast her arrival Little Wade had to be held up time and again so that ladies who ventured as far through the ooze as their carriage blocks could exclaim over him They all cried to her that she must join their knitting and sewing circles and their hospital committees and no one elses and she promised recklessly to right and left As they passed a rambling green clapboard house a little black girl posted on the front steps cried Hyah she come and Dr Meade and his wife and little thirteenyearold Phil emerged calling greetings Scarlett recalled that they too had been at her wedding Mrs Meade mounted her carriage block and craned her neck for a view of the baby but the doctor disregarding the mud plowed through to the side of the carriage He was tall and gaunt and wore a pointed beard of iron gray and his clothes hung on his spare figure as though blown there by a hurricane Atlanta considered him the root of all strength and all wisdom and it was not strange that he had absorbed something of their belief But for all his habit of making oracular statements and his slightly pompous manner he was as kindly a man as the town possessed After shaking her hand and prodding Wade in the stomach and complimenting him the doctor announced that Aunt Pittypat had promised on oath that Scarlett should be on no other hospital and bandagerolling committee save Mrs Meades Oh dear but Ive promised a thousand ladies already said Scarlett Mrs Merriwether Ill be bound cried Mrs Meade indignantly Drat the woman I believe she meets every train I promised because I hadnt a notion what it was all about Scarlett confessed What are hospital committees anyway Both the doctor and his wife looked slightly shocked at her ignorance But of course youve been buried in the country and couldnt know Mrs Meade apologized for her We have nursing committees for different hospitals and for different days We nurse the men and help the doctors and make bandages and clothes and when the men are well enough to leave the hospitals we take them into our homes to convalesce till they are able to go back in the army And we look after the wives and families of some of the wounded who are destituteyes worse than destitute Dr Meade is at the Institute hospital where my committee works and everyone says hes marvelous and There there Mrs Meade said the doctor fondly Dont go bragging on me in front of folks Its little enough I can do since you wouldnt let me go in the army  Wouldnt let  she cried indignantly Me The town wouldnt let you and you know it Why Scarlett when folks heard he was intending to go to Virginia as an army surgeon all the ladies signed a petition begging him to stay here Of course the town couldnt do without you There there Mrs Meade said the doctor basking obviously in the praise Perhaps with one boy at the front thats enough for the time being And Im going next year cried little Phil hopping about excitedly As a drummer boy Im learning how to drum now Do you want to hear me Ill run get my drum No not now said Mrs Meade drawing him closer to her a sudden look of strain coming over her face Not next year darling Maybe the year after But the war will be over then he cried petulantly pulling away from her And you promised Over his head the eyes of the parents met and Scarlett saw the look Darcy Meade was in Virginia and they were clinging closer to the little boy that was left Uncle Peter cleared his throat Miss Pitty were in a state when Ah lef home an ef Ah doan git dar soon shell done swooned Goodby Ill be over this afternoon called Mrs Meade And you tell Pitty for me that if you arent on my committee shes going to be in a worse state The carriage slipped and slid down the muddy road and Scarlett leaned back on the cushions and smiled She felt better now than she had felt in months Atlanta with its crowds and its hurry and its undercurrent of driving excitement was very pleasant very exhilarating so very much nicer than the lonely plantation out from Charleston where the bellow of alligators broke the night stillness better than Charleston itself dreaming in its gardens behind its high walls better than Savannah with its wide streets lined with palmetto and the muddy river beside it Yes and temporarily even better than Tara dear though Tara was There was something exciting about this town with its narrow muddy streets lying among rolling red hills something raw and crude that appealed to the rawness and crudeness underlying the fine veneer that Ellen and Mammy had given her She suddenly felt that this was where she belonged not in serene and quiet old cities flat beside yellow waters The houses were farther and farther apart now and leaning out Scarlett saw the red brick and slate roof of Miss Pittypats house It was almost the last house on the north side of town Beyond it Peachtree road narrowed and twisted under great trees out of sight into thick quiet woods The neat woodenpaneled fence had been newly painted white and the front yard it enclosed was yellow starred with the last jonquils of the season On the front steps stood two women in black and behind them a large yellow woman with her hands under her apron and her white teeth showing in a wide smile Plump Miss Pittypat was teetering excitedly on tiny feet one hand pressed to her copious bosom to still her fluttering heart Scarlett saw Melanie standing by her and with a surge of dislike she realized that the fly in the ointment of Atlanta would be this slight little person in black mourning dress her riotous dark curls subdued to matronly smoothness and a loving smile of welcome and happiness on her heartshaped face  Page    Gone With The Wind When a Southerner took the trouble to pack a trunk and travel twenty miles for a visit the visit was seldom of shorter duration than a month usually much longer Southerners were as enthusiastic visitors as they were hosts and there was nothing unusual in relatives coming to spend the Christmas holidays and remaining until July Often when newly married couples went on the usual round of honeymoon visits they lingered in some pleasant home until the birth of their second child Frequently elderly aunts and uncles came to Sunday dinner and remained until they were buried years later Visitors presented no problem for houses were large servants numerous and the feeding of several extra mouths a minor matter in that land of plenty All ages and sexes went visiting honeymooners young mothers showing off new babies convalescents the bereaved girls whose parents were anxious to remove them from the dangers of unwise matches girls who had reached the danger age without becoming en gaged and who it was hoped would make suitable matches under the guidance of relatives in other places Visitors added excitement and variety to the slowmoving Southern life and they were always welcome So Scarlett had come to Atlanta with no idea as to how long she would remain If her visit proved as dull as those in Savannah and Charleston she would return home in a month If her stay was pleasant she would remain indefinitely But no sooner had she arrived than Aunt Pitty and Melanie began a campaign to induce her to make her home permanently with them They brought up every possible argument They wanted her for her own self because they loved her They were lonely and often frightened at night in the big house and she was so brave she gave them courage She was so charming that she cheered them in their sorrow Now that Charles was dead her place and her sons place were with his kindred Besides half the house now belonged to her through Charles will Last the Confederacy needed every pair of hands for sewing knitting bandage rolling and nursing the wounded Charles Uncle Henry Hamilton who lived in bachelor state at the Atlanta Hotel near the depot also talked seriously to her on this subject Uncle Henry was a short potbellied irascible old gentleman with a pink face a shock of long silver hair and an utter lack of patience with feminine timidities and vaporings It was for the latter reason that he was barely on speaking terms with his sister Miss Pittypat From childhood they had been exact opposites in temperament and they had been further estranged by his objections to the manner in which she had reared CharlesMaking a damn sissy out of a soldiers son Years before he had so insulted her that now Miss Pitty never spoke of him except in guarded whispers and with so great reticence that a stranger would have thought the honest old lawyer a murderer at the least The insult had occurred on a day when Pitty wished to draw five hundred dollars from her estate of which he was trustee to invest in a nonexistent gold mine He had refused to permit it and stated heatedly that she had no more sense than a June bug and furthermore it gave him the fidgets to be around her longer than five minutes Since that day she only saw him formally once a month when Uncle Peter drove her to his office to get the housekeeping money After these brief visits Pitty always took to her bed for the rest of the day with tears and smelling salts Melanie and Charles who were on excellent terms with their uncle had frequently offered to relieve her of this ordeal but Pitty always set her babyish mouth firmly and refused Henry was her cross and she must bear him From this Charles and Melanie could only infer that she took a profound pleasure in this occasional excitement the only excitement in her sheltered life Uncle Henry liked Scarlett immediately because he said he could see that for all her silly affectations she had a few grains of sense He was trustee not only of Pittys and Melanies estates but also of that left Scarlett by Charles It came to Scarlett as a pleasant surprise that she was now a welltodo young woman for Charles had not only left her half of Aunt Pittys house but farm lands and town property as well And the stores and warehouses along the railroad track near the depot which were part of her inheritance had tripled in value since the war began It was when Uncle Henry was giving her an account of her property that he broached the matter of her permanent residence in Atlanta When Wade Hampton comes of age hes going to be a rich young man he said The way Atlanta is growing his property will be ten times more valuable in twenty years and its only right that the boy should be raised where his property is so he can learn to take care of ityes and of Pittys and Melanies too Hell be the only man of the Hamilton name left before long for I wont be here forever As for Uncle Peter he took it for granted that Scarlett had come to stay It was inconceivable to him that Charles only son should be reared where he could not supervise the rearing To all these arguments Scarlett smiled but said nothing unwilling to commit herself before learning how she would like Atlanta and constant association with her inlaws She knew too that Gerald and Ellen would have to be won over Moreover now that she was away from Tara she missed it dreadfully missed the red fields and the springing green cotton and the sweet twilight silences For the first time she realized dimly what Gerald had meant when he said that the love of the land was in her blood So she gracefully evaded for the time being a definite answer as to the duration of her visit and slipped easily into the life of the redbrick house at the quiet end of Peachtree Street Living with Charles blood kin seeing the home from which he came Scarlett could now understand a little better the boy who had made her wife widow and mother in such rapid succession It was easy to see why he had been so shy so unsophisticated so idealistic If Charles had inherited any of the qualities of the stern fearless hottempered soldier who had been his father they had been obliterated in childhood by the ladylike atmosphere in which he had been reared He had been devoted to the childlike Pitty and closer than brothers usually are to Melanie and two more sweet unworldly women could not be found Aunt Pittypat had been christened Sarah lane Hamilton sixty years before but since the longpast day when her doting father had fastened his nickname upon her because of her airy restless pattering little feet no one had called her anything else In the years that followed that second christening many changes had taken place in her that made the pet name incongruous Of the swiftly scampering child all that now remained were two tiny feet inadequate to her weight and a tendency to prattle happily and aimlessly She was stout pink cheeked and silver haired and always a little breathless from too tightly laced stays She was unable to walk more than a block on the tiny feet which she crammed into too small slippers She had a heart which fluttered at any excitement and she pampered it shamelessly faulting at any provocation Everyone knew that her swoons were generally mere ladylike pretenses but they loved her enough to refrain from saying so Everyone loved her spoiled her like a child and refused to take her seriouslyeveryone except her brother Henry She liked gossip better than anything else in the world even more than she liked the pleasures of the table and she prattled on  Page    Gone With The Wind for hours about other peoples affairs in a harmless kindly way She had no memory for names dates or places and frequently confused the actors in one Atlanta drama with the actors in another which misled no one for no one was foolish enough to take seriously anything she said No one ever told her anything really shocking or scandalous for her spinster state must be protected even if she was sixty years old and her friends were in a kindly conspiracy to keep her a sheltered and petted old child Melanie was like her aunt in many ways She had her shyness her sudden blushes her modesty but she did have common senseOf a sort Ill admit that Scarlett thought grudgingly Like Aunt Pitty Melanie had the face of a sheltered child who had never known anything but simplicity and kindness truth and love a child who had never looked upon harshness or evil and would not recognize them if she saw them Because she had always been happy she wanted everyone about her to be happy or at least pleased with themselves To this end she always saw the best in everyone and remarked kindly upon it There was no servant so stupid that she did not find some redeeming trait of loyalty and kindheartedness no girl so ugly and disagreeable that she could not discover grace of form or nobility of character in her and no man so worthless or so boring that she did not view him in the light of his possibilities rather than his actualities Because of these qualities that came sincerely and spontaneously from a generous heart everyone flocked about her for who can resist the charm of one who discovers in others admirable qualities undreamed of even by himself She had more girl friends than anyone in town and more men friends too though she had few beaux for she lacked the willfulness and selfishness that go far toward trapping mens hearts What Melanie did was no more than all Southern girls were taught to doto make those about them feel at ease and pleased with themselves It was this happy feminine conspiracy which made Southern society so pleasant Women knew that a land where men were contented uncontradicted and safe in possession of unpunctured vanity was likely to be a very pleasant place for women to live So from the cradle to the grave women strove to make men pleased with themselves and the satisfied men repaid lavishly with gallantry and adoration In fact men willingly gave the ladies everything in the world except credit for having intelligence Scarlett exercised the same charms as Melanie but with a studied artistry and consummate skill The difference between the two girls lay in the fact that Melanie spoke kind and flattering words from a desire to make people happy if only temporarily and Scarlett never did it except to further her own aims From the two he loved best Charles had received no toughening influences learned nothing of harshness or reality and the home in which he grew to manhood was as soft as a birds nest It was such a quiet oldfashioned gentle home compared with Tara To Scarlett this house cried out for the masculine smells of brandy tobacco and Macassar oil for hoarse voices and occasional curses for guns for whiskers for saddles and bridles and for hounds underfoot She missed the sounds of quarreling voices that were always heard at Tara when Ellens back was turned Mammy quarreling with Pork Rosa and Teena bickering her own acrimonious arguments with Suellen Geralds bawling threats No wonder Charles had been a sissy coming from a home like this Here excitement never entered in voices were never raised everyone deferred gently to the opinions of others and in the end the black grizzled autocrat in the kitchen had his way Scarlett who had hoped for a freer rein when she escaped Mammys supervision discovered to her sorrow that Uncle Peters standards of ladylike conduct especially for Mist Charles widow were even stricter than Mammys In such a household Scarlett came back to herself and almost before she realized it her spirits rose to normal She was only seventeen she had superb health and energy and Charles people did their best to make her happy If they fell a little short of this it was not their fault for no one could take out of her heart the ache that throbbed whenever Ashleys name was mentioned And Melanie mentioned it so often But Melanie and Pitty were tireless in planning ways to soothe the sorrow under which they thought she labored They put their own grief into the background in order to divert her They fussed about her food and her hours for taking afternoon naps and for taking carriage rides They not only admired her extravagantly her highspiritedness her figure her tiny hands and feet her white skin but they said so frequently petting hugging and kissing her to emphasize their loving words Scarlett did not care for the caresses but she basked in the compliments No one at Tara had ever said so many charming things about her In fact Mammy had spent her time deflating her conceit Little Wade was no longer an annoyance for the family black and white and the neighbors idolized him and there was a neverceasing rivalry as to whose lap he should occupy Melanie especially doted on him Even in his worst screaming spells Melanie thought him adorable and said so adding Oh you pre cious darling I just wish you were mine Sometimes Scarlett found it hard to dissemble her feelings for she still thought Aunt Pitty the silliest of old ladies and her vagueness and vaporings irritated her unendurably She disliked Melanie with a jealous dislike that grew as the days went by and sometimes she had to leave the room abruptly when Melanie beaming with loving pride spoke of Ashley or read his letters aloud But all in all life went on as happily as was possible under the circumstances Atlanta was more interesting than Savannah or Charleston or Tara and it offered so many strange wartime occupations she had little time to think or mope But sometimes when she blew out the candle and burrowed her head into the pillow she sighed and thought If only Ashley wasnt married If only I didnt have to nurse in that plagued hospital Oh if only I could have some beaux She had immediately loathed nursing but she could not escape this duty because she was on both Mrs Meades and Mrs Merriwethers committees That meant four mornings a week in the sweltering stinking hospital with her hair tied up in a towel and a hot apron covering her from neck to feet Every matron old or young in Atlanta nursed and did it with an enthusiasm that seemed to Scarlett little short of fanatic They took it for granted that she was imbued with their own patriotic fervor and would have been shocked to know how slight an interest in the war she had Except for the everpresent torment that Ashley might be killed the war interested her not at all and nursing was something she did simply because she didnt know how to get out of it Certainly there was nothing romantic about nursing To her it meant groans delirium death and smells The hospitals were filled with dirty bewhiskered verminous men who smelled terribly and bore on their bodies wounds hideous enough to turn a Christians stomach The hospitals stank of gangrene the odor assaulting her nostrils long before the doors were reached a sickish sweet smell that clung to her hands and hair and haunted her in her dreams Flies mosquitoes and gnats hovered in droning singing swarms over the wards tormenting the men to curses and weak sobs and Scarlett scratching her own mosquito  Page    Gone With The Wind bites swung palmetto fans until her shoulders ached and she wished that all the men were dead Melanie however did not seem to mind the smells the wounds or the nakedness which Scarlett thought strange in one who was the most timorous and modest of women Sometimes when holding basins and instruments while Dr Meade cut out gangrened flesh Melanie looked very white And once after such an operation Scarlett found her in the linen closet vomiting quietly into a towel But as long as she was where the wounded could see her she was gentle sympathetic and cheerful and the men in the hospitals called her an angel of mercy Scarlett would have liked that title too but it involved touching men crawling with lice running fingers down throats of unconscious patients to see if they were choking on swallowed tobacco quids bandaging stumps and picking maggots out of festering flesh No she did not like nursing Perhaps it might have been endurable if she had been permitted to use her charms on the convalescent men for many of them were attractive and well born but this she could not do in her widowed state The young ladies of the town who were not permitted to nurse for fear they would see sights unfit for virgin eyes had the convalescent wards in their charge Unhampered by matrimony or widowhood they made vast inroads on the convalescents and even the least attractive girls Scarlett observed gloomily had no difficulty in getting engaged With the exception of desperately ill and severely wounded men Scarletts was a completely feminized world and this irked her for she neither liked nor trusted her own sex and worse still was always bored by it But on three afternoons a week she had to attend sewing circles and bandagerolling committees of Melanies friends The girls who had all known Charles were very kind and attentive to her at these gatherings especially Fanny Elsing and Maybelle Merriwether the daughters of the town dowagers But they treated her deferentially as if she were old and finished and their constant chatter of dances and beaux made her both envious of their pleasures and resentful that her widowhood barred her from such activities Why she was three times as attractive as Fanny and Maybelle Oh how unfair life was How unfair that everyone should think her heart was in the grave when it wasnt at all It was in Virginia with Ashley But in spite of these discomforts Atlanta pleased her very well And her visit lengthened as the weeks slipped by CHAPTER IX SCARLETT sat in the window of her bedroom that midsummer morning and disconsolately watched the wagons and carriages full of girls soldiers and chaperons ride gaily out Peachtree road in search of woodland decorations for the bazaar which was to be held that evening for the benefit of the hospitals The red road lay checkered in shade and sun glare beneath the overarching trees and the many hooves kicked up little red clouds of dust One wagon ahead of the others bore four stout negroes with axes to cut evergreens and drag down the vines and the back of this wagon was piled high with napkincovered hampers splitoak baskets of lunch and a dozen watermelons Two of the black bucks were equipped with banjo and harmonica and they were rendering a spirited version of If You Want to Have a Good Time Jine the Cavalry Behind them streamed the merry cavalcade girls cool in flowered cotton dresses with light shawls bonnets and mitts to protect their skins and little parasols held over their heads elderly ladies placid and smiling amid the laughter and carriagetocarriage calls and jokes convalescents from the hospitals wedged in between stout chaperons and slender girls who made great fuss and todo over them officers on horseback idling at snails pace beside the carriageswheels creaking spurs jingling gold braid gleaming parasols bobbing fans swishing negroes singing Everybody was riding out Peachtree road to gather greenery and have a picnic and melon cutting Everybody thought Scarlett morosely except me They all waved and called to her as they went by and she tried to respond with a good grace but it was difficult A hard little pain had started in her heart and was traveling slowly up toward her throat where it would become a lump and the lump would soon become tears Everybody was going to the picnic except her And everybody was going to the bazaar and the ball tonight except her That is everybody except her and Pittypat and Melly and the other unfortunates in town who were in mourning But Melly and Pittypat did not seem to mind It had not even occurred to them to want to go It had occurred to Scarlett And she did want to go tremendously It simply wasnt fair She had worked twice as hard as any girl in town getting things ready for the bazaar She had knitted socks and baby caps and afghans and mufflers and tatted yards of lace and painted china hair receivers and mustache cups And she had embroidered half a dozen sofapillow cases with the Confederate flag on them The stars were a bit lopsided to be sure some of them being almost round and others having six or even seven points but the effect was good Yesterday she had worked until she was worn out in the dusty old bam of an Armory draping yellow and pink and green cheesecloth on the booths that lined the walls Under the supervision of the Ladies Hospital Committee this was plain hard work and no fun at all It was never fun to be around Mrs Merriwether and Mrs Elsing and Mrs Whiting and have them boss you like you were one of the darkies And have to listen to them brag about how popular their daughters were And worst of all she had burned two blisters on her fingers helping Pittypat and Cookie make layer cakes for raffling And now having worked like a field hand she had to retire decorously when the fun was just beginning Oh it wasnt fair that she should have a dead husband and a baby yelling in the next room and be out of everything that was pleasant Just a little over a year ago she was dancing and wearing bright clothes instead of this dark mourning and was practically engaged to three boys She was only seventeen now and there was still a lot of dancing left in her feet Oh it wasnt fair Life was going past her down a hot shady summer road life with gray uniforms and jingling spurs and flowered organdie dresses and banjos playing She tried not to smile and wave too enthusiastically to the men she knew best the ones shed nursed in the hospital but it was hard to subdue her dimples hard to look as though her heart were in the gravewhen it wasnt Her bowing and waving were abruptly halted when Pittypat entered the room panting as usual from climbing the stairs and jerked her away from the window unceremoniously Have you lost your mind honey waving at men out of your bedroom window I declare Scarlett Im shocked What would your mother say Well they didnt know it was my bedroom  Page    Gone With The Wind But theyd suspect it was your bedroom and thats just as bad Honey you mustnt do things like that Everybody will be talking about you and saying you are fastand anyway Mrs Merriwether knew it was your bedroom And I suppose shell tell all the boys the old cat Honey hush Dolly Merriwethers my best friend Well shes a cat just the sameoh Im sorry Auntie dont cry I forgot it was my bedroom window I wont do it againII just wanted to see them go by I wish I was going Honey Well I do Im so tired of sitting at home Scarlett promise me you wont say things like that People would talk so Theyd say you didnt have the proper respect for poor Charlie Oh Auntie dont cry Oh now Ive made you cry too sobbed Pittypat in a pleased way fumbling in her skirt pocket for her handkerchief The hard little pain had at last reached Scarletts throat and she wailed out loudnot as Pittypat thought for poor Charlie but because the last sounds of the wheels and the laughter were dying away Melanie rustled in from her room a worried frown puckering her forehead a brush in her hands her usually tidy black hair freed of its net fluffing about her face in a mass of tiny curls and waves Darlings What is the matter Charlie sobbed Pittypat surrendering utterly to the pleasure of her grief and burying her head on Mellys shoulder Oh said Melly her lip quivering at the mention of her brothers name Be brave dear Dont cry Oh Scarlett Scarlett had thrown herself on the bed and was sobbing at the top of her voice sobbing for her lost youth and the pleasures of youth that were denied her sobbing with the indignation and despair of a child who once could get anything she wanted by sobbing and now knows that sobbing can no longer help her She burrowed her head in the pillow and cried and kicked her feet at the tufted counterpane I might as well be dead she sobbed passionately Before such an exhibition of grief Pittypats easy tears ceased and Melly flew to the bedside to comfort her sisterinlaw Dear dont cry Try to think how much Charlie loved you and let that comfort you Try to think of your darling baby Indignation at being misunderstood mingled with Scarletts forlorn feeling of being out of everything and strangled all utterance That was fortunate for if she could have spoken she would have cried out truths coached in Geralds forthright words Melanie patted her shoulder and Pittypat tiptoed heavily about the room pulling down the shades Dont do that shouted Scarlett raising a red and swollen face from the pillow Im not dead enough for you to pull down the shadesthough I might as well be Oh do go away and leave me alone She sank her face into the pillow again and after a whispered conference the two standing over her tiptoed out She heard Melanie say to Pittypat in a low voice as they went down the stairs Aunt Pitty I wish you wouldnt speak of Charles to her You know how it always affects her Poor thing she gets that queer look and I know shes trying not to cry We mustnt make it harder for her Scarlett kicked the coverlet in impotent rage trying to think of something bad enough to say Gods nightgown she cried at last and felt somewhat relieved How could Melanie be content to stay at home and never have any fun and wear crpe for her brother when she was only eighteen years old Melanie did not seem to know or care that life was riding by with jingling spurs But shes such a stick thought Scarlett pounding the pillow And she never was popular like me so she doesnt miss the things I miss Andand besides shes got Ashley and II havent got anybody And at this fresh woe she broke into renewed outcries She remained gloomily in her room until afternoon and then the sight of the returning picnickers with wagons piled high with pine boughs vines and ferns did not cheer her Everyone looked happily tired as they waved to her again and she returned their greetings drearily Life was a hopeless affair and certainly not worth living Deliverance came in the form she least expected when during the afterdinnernap period Mrs Merriwether and Mrs Elsing drove up Startled at having callers at such an hour Melanie Scarlett and Aunt Pittypat roused themselves hastily hooked their basques smoothed their hair and descended to the parlor Mrs Bonnells children have the measles said Mrs Merriwether abruptly showing plainly that she held Mrs Bonnell personally responsible for permitting such a thing to happen And the McLure girls have been called to Virginia said Mrs Elsing in her dieaway voice fanning herself languidly as if neither this nor anything else mattered very much Dallas McLure is wounded How dreadful chorused their hostesses Is poor Dallas No Just through the shoulder said Mrs Merriwether briskly But it couldnt possibly have happened at a worse time The girls are going North to bring him home But skies above we havent time to sit here talking We must hurry back to the Armory and get the decorating done Pitty we need you and Melly tonight to take Mrs Bonnells and the McLure girls places Oh but Dolly we cant go Dont say cant to me Pittypat Hamilton said Mrs Merriwether vigorously We need you to watch the darkies with the refreshments That was what Mrs Bonnell was to do And Melly you must take the McLure girls booth Oh we just couldntwith poor Charlie dead only a I know how you feel but there isnt any sacrifice too great for the Cause broke in Mrs Elsing in a soft voice that settled matters Oh wed love to help butwhy cant you get some sweet pretty girls to take the booths Mrs Merriwether snorted a trumpeting snort I dont know whats come over the young people these days They have no sense of responsibility All the girls who havent  Page    Gone With The Wind already taken booths have more excuses than you could shake a stick at Oh they dont fool me They just dont want to be hampered in making up to the officers thats all And theyre afraid their new dresses wont show off behind booth counters I wish to goodness that blockade runnerwhats his name Captain Butler supplied Mrs Elsing I wish hed bring in more hospital supplies and less hoop skirts and lace If Ive had to look at one dress today Ive had to look at twenty dresses that he ran in Captain ButlerIm sick of the name Now Pitty I havent time to argue You must come Everybody will understand Nobody will see you in the back room anyway and Melly wont be conspicuous The poor McLure girls booth is way down at the end and not very pretty so nobody will notice you I think we should go said Scarlett trying to curb her eagerness and to keep her face earnest and simple It is the least we can do for the hospital Neither of the visiting ladies had even mentioned her name and they turned and looked sharply at her Even in their extremity they had not considered asking a widow of scarcely a year to appear at a social function Scarlett bore their gaze with a wideeyed childlike expression I think we should go and help to make it a success all of us I think I should go in the booth with Melly becausewell I think it would look better for us both to be there instead of just one Dont you think so Melly Well began Melly helplessly The idea of appearing publicly at a social gathering while in mourning was so unheard of she was bewildered Scarletts right said Mrs Merriwether observing signs of weakening She rose and jerked her hoops into place Both of youall of you must come Now Pitty dont start your excuses again Just think how much the hospital needs money for new beds and drugs And I know Charlie would like you to help the Cause he died for Well said Pittypat helpless as always in the presence of a stronger personality if you think people will understand Too good to be true Too good to be true said Scarletts joyful heart as she slipped unobtrusively into the pink and yellowdraped booth that was to have been the McLure girls Actually she was at a party After a years seclusion after crpe and hushed voices and nearly going crazy with boredom she was actually at a party the biggest party Atlanta had ever seen And she could see people and many lights and hear music and view for herself the lovely laces and frocks and frills that the famous Captain Butler had run through the blockade on his last trip She sank down on one of the little stools behind the counter of the booth and looked up and down the long hall which until this afternoon had been a bare and ugly drill room How the ladies must have worked today to bring it to its present beauty It looked lovely Every candle and candlestick in Atlanta must be in this hall tonight she thought silver ones with a dozen sprangling arms china ones with charming figurines clustering their bases old brass stands erect and dignified laden with candles of all sizes and colors smelling fragrantly of bayberries standing on the gun racks that ran the length of the hall on the long flowerdecked tables on booth counters even on the sills of the open windows where the draughts of warm summer air were just strong enough to make them flare In the center of the hall the huge ugly lamp hanging from the ceiling by rusty chains was completely transformed by twining ivy and wild grapevines that were already withering from the heat The walls were banked with pine branches that gave out a spicy smell making the corners of the room into pretty bowers where the chaperons and old ladies would sit Long graceful ropes of ivy and grapevine and smilax were hung everywhere in looping festoons on the walls draped above the windows twined in scallops all over the brightly colored cheesecloth booths And everywhere amid the greenery on flags and bunting blazed the bright stars of the Confederacy on their background of red and blue The raised platform for the musicians was especially artistic It was completely hidden from view by the banked greenery and starry bunting and Scarlett knew that every potted and tubbed plant in town was there coleus geranium hydrangea oleander elephant eareven Mrs Elsings four treasured rubber plants which were given posts of honor at the four corners At the other end of the hall from the platform the ladies had eclipsed themselves On this wall hung large pictures of President Davis and Georgias own Little Alec Stephens VicePresident of the Confederacy Above them was an enormous flag and beneath on long tables was the loot of the gardens of the town ferns banks of roses crimson and yellow and white proud sheaths of golden gladioli masses of varicolored nasturtiums tall stiff hollyhocks rearing deep maroon and creamy heads above the other flowers Among them candles burned serenely like altar fires The two faces looked down on the scene two faces as different as could be possible in two men at the helm of so momentous an undertaking Davis with the flat cheeks and cold eyes of an ascetic his thin proud lips set firmly Stephens with dark burning eyes deep socketed in a face that had known nothing but sickness and pain and had triumphed over them with humor and with firetwo faces that were greatly loved The elderly ladies of the committee in whose hands rested the responsibility for the whole bazaar rustled in as importantly as fullrigged ships hurried the belated young matrons and giggling girls into their booths and then swept through the doors into the back rooms where the refreshments were being laid out Aunt Pitty panted out after them The musicians clambered upon their platform black grinning their fat cheeks already shining with perspiration and began tuning their fiddles and sawing and whanging with their bows in anticipatory importance Old Levi Mrs Merriwethers coachman who had led the orchestras for every bazaar ball and wedding since Atlanta was named Marthasville rapped with his bow for attention Few except the ladies who were conducting the bazaar had arrived yet but all eyes turned toward him Then the fiddles bull fiddles accordions banjos and knucklebones broke into a slow rendition of Lorenatoo slow for dancing the dancing would come later when the booths were emptied of their wares Scarlett felt her heart beat faster as the sweet melancholy of the waltz came to her The years creep slowly by Lorena The snow is on the grass again The suns far down the sky Lorena   Page    Gone With The Wind Onetwothree onetwothree dipswaythree turn twothree What a beautiful waltz She extended her hands slightly closed her eyes and swayed with the sad haunting rhythm There was something about the tragic melody and Lorenas lost love that mingled with her own excitement and brought a lump into her throat Then as if brought into being by the waltz music sounds floated in from the shadowy moonlit street below the trample of horses hooves and the sound of carriage wheels laughter on the warm sweet air and the soft acrimony of negro voices raised in argument over hitching places for the horses There was confusion on the stairs and lighthearted merriment the mingling of girls fresh voices with the bass notes of their escorts airy cries of greeting and squeals of joy as girls recognized friends from whom they had parted only that afternoon Suddenly the hall burst into life It was full of girls girls who floated in butterfly bright dresses hooped out enormously lace pantalets peeping from beneath round little white shoulders bare and faintest traces of soft little bosoms showing above lace flounces lace shawls carelessly hanging from arms fans spangled and painted fans of swansdown and peacock feathers dangling at wrists by tiny velvet ribbons girls with masses of golden curls about their necks and fringed gold earbobs that tossed and danced with their dancing curls Laces and silks and braid and ribbons all blockade run all the more precious and more proudly worn because of it finery flaunted with an added pride as an extra affront to the Yankees Not all the Sowers of the town were standing in tribute to the leaders of the Confederacy The smallest the most fragrant blossoms bedecked the girls Tea roses tucked behind pink ears cape jessamine and bud roses in round little garlands over cascades of side curls blossoms thrust demurely into satin sashes flowers that before the night was over would find their way into the breast pockets of gray uniforms as treasured souvenirs There were so many uniforms in the crowdso many uniforms on so many men whom Scarlett knew men she had met on hospital cots on the streets at the drill ground They were such resplendent uniforms brave with shining buttons and dazzling with twined gold braid on cuffs and collars the red and yellow and blue stripes on the trousers for the different branches of the service setting off the gray to perfection Scarlet and gold sashes swung to and fro sabers glittered and banged against shining boots spurs rattled and jingled Such handsome men thought Scarlett with a swell of pride in her heart as the men called greetings waved to friends bent low over the hands of elderly ladies All of them were so young looking even with their sweeping yellow mustaches and full black and brown beards so handsome so reckless with their arms in slings with head bandages startlingly white across sunbrowned faces Some of them were on crutches and how proud were the girls who solicitously slowed their steps to their escorts hopping pace There was one gaudy splash of color among the uniforms that put the girls bright finery to shame and stood out in the crowd like a tropical birda Louisiana Zouave with baggy blue and white striped pants cream gaiters and tight little red jacket a dark grinning little monkey of a man with his arm in a black silk sling He was Maybelle Merriwethers especial beau Ren Picard The whole hospital must have turned out at least everybody who could walk and all the men on furlough and sick leave and all the railroad and mail service and hospital and commissary departments between here and Macon How pleased the ladies would be The hospital should make a mint of money tonight There was a ruffle of drums from the street below the tramp of feet the admiring cries of coachmen A bugle blared and a bass voice shouted the command to break ranks In a moment the Home Guard and the militia unit in their bright uniforms shook the narrow stairs and crowded into the room bowing saluting shaking hands There were boys in the Home Guard proud to be playing at war promising themselves they would be in Virginia this time next year if the war would just last that long old men with white beards wishing they were younger proud to march in uniform in the reflected glory of sons at the front In the militia there were many middleaged men and some older men but there was a fair sprinkling of men of military age who did not carry themselves quite so jauntily as their elders or their juniors Already people were beginning to whisper asking why they were not with Lee How would they all get into the hall It had seemed such a large place a few minutes before and now it was packed warm with summernight odors of sachet and cologne water and hair pomade and burning bayberry candles fragrant with flowers faintly dusty as many feet trod the old drill floors The din and hubbub of voices made it almost impossible to hear anything and as if feeling the joy and excitement of the occasion old Levi choked off Lorena in midbar rapped sharply with his bow and sawing away for dear life the orchestra burst into Bonnie Blue Flag A hundred voices took it up sang it shouted it like a cheer The Home Guard bugler climbing onto the platform caught up with the music just as the chorus began and the high silver notes soared out thrillingly above the massed singing causing goose bumps to break out on bare arms and cold chills of deeply felt emotion to fly down spines Hurrah Hurrah For the Southern Rights hurrah Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag That bears a single star They crashed into the second verse and Scarlett singing with the rest heard the high sweet soprano of Melanie mounting behind her clear and true and thrilling as the bugle notes Turning she saw that Melly was standing with her hands clasped to her breast her eyes closed and tiny tears oozing from the corners She smiled at Scarlett whimsically as the music ended making a little moue of apology as she dabbed with her handkerchief Im so happy she whispered and so proud of the soldiers that I just cant help crying about it There was a deep almost fanatic glow in her eyes that for a moment lit up her plain little face and made it beautiful The same look was on the faces of all the women as the song ended tears of pride on cheeks pink or wrinkled smiles on lips a deep hot glow in eyes as they turned to their men sweetheart to lover mother to son wife to husband They were all beautiful with the blinding beauty that transfigures even the plainest woman when she is utterly protected and utterly loved and is giving back that love a thousandfold  Page    Gone With The Wind They loved their men they believed in them they trusted them to the last breaths of their bodies How could disaster ever come to women such as they when their stalwart gray line stood between them and the Yankees Had there ever been such men as these since the first dawn of the world so heroic so reckless so gallant so tender How could anything but overwhelming victory come to a Cause as just and right as theirs A Cause they loved as much as they loved their men a Cause they served with their hands and their hearts a Cause they talked about thought about dreamed abouta Cause to which they would sacrifice these men if need be and bear their loss as proudly as the men bore their battle flags It was high tide of devotion and pride in their hearts high tide of the Confederacy for final victory was at hand Stonewall Jacksons triumphs in the Valley and the defeat of the Yankees in the Seven Days Battle around Richmond showed that clearly How could it be otherwise with such leaders as Lee and Jackson One more victory and the Yankees would be on their knees yelling for peace and the men would be riding home and there would be kissing and laughter One more victory and the war was over Of course there were empty chairs and babies who would never see their fathers faces and unmarked graves by lonely Virginia creeks and in the still mountains of Tennessee but was that too great a price to pay for such a Cause Silks for the ladies and tea and sugar were hard to get but that was something to joke about Besides the dashing blockade runners were bringing in these very things under the Yankees disgruntled noses and that made the possession of them many times more thrilling Soon Raphael Semmes and the Confederate Navy would tend to those Yankee gunboats and the ports would be wide open And England was coming in to help the Confederacy win the war because the English mills were standing idle for want of Southern cotton And naturally the British aristocracy sympathized with the Confederacy as one aristocrat with another against a race of dollar lovers like the Yankees So the women swished their silks and laughed and looking on their men with hearts bursting with pride they knew that love snatched in the face of danger and death was doubly sweet for the strange excitement that went with it When first she looked at the crowd Scarletts heart had thumpthumped with the unaccustomed excitement of being at a party but as she halfcomprehendingly saw the highhearted look on the faces about her her joy began to evaporate Every woman present was blazing with an emotion she did not feel It bewildered and depressed her Somehow the hall did not seem so pretty nor the girls so dashing and the white heat of devotion to the Cause that was still shining on every face seemedwhy it just seemed silly In a sudden flash of selfknowledge that made her mouth pop open with astonishment she realized that she did not share with these women their fierce pride their desire to sacrifice themselves and everything they had for the Cause Before horror made her think Nono I mustnt think such things Theyre wrongsinful she knew the Cause meant nothing at all to her and that she was bored with heating other people talk about it with that fanatic look in their eyes The Cause didnt seem sacred to her The war didnt seem to be a holy affair but a nuisance that killed men senselessly and cost money and made luxuries hard to get She saw that she was tired of the endless knitting and the endless bandage rolling and lint picking that roughened the cuticle of her nails And oh she was so tired of the hospital Tired and bored and nauseated with the sickening gangrene smells and the endless moaning frightened by the look that coming death gave to sunken faces She looked furtively around her as the treacherous blasphemous thoughts rushed through her mind fearful that someone might find them written clearly upon her face Oh why couldnt she feel like those other women They were whole hearted and sincere in their devotion to the Cause They really meant everything they said and did And if anyone should ever suspect that she No no one must ever know She must go on making a pretense of enthusiasm and pride in the Cause which she could not feel acting out her part of the widow of a Confederate officer who bears her grief bravely whose heart is in the grave who feels that her husbands death meant nothing if it aided the Cause to triumph Oh why was she different apart from these loving women She could never love anything or anyone so selflessly as they did What a lonely feeling it wasand she had never been lonely either in body or spirit before At first she tried to stifle the thoughts but the hard selfhonesty that lay at the base of her nature would not permit it And so while the bazaar went on while she and Melanie waited on the customers who came to their booth her mind was busily working trying to justify herself to herselfa task which she seldom found difficult The other women were simply silly and hysterical with their talk of patriotism and the Cause and the men were almost as bad with their talk of vital issues and States Rights She Scarlett OHara Hamilton alone had good hardheaded Irish sense She wasnt going to make a fool out of herself about the Cause but neither was she going to make a fool out of herself by admitting her true feelings She was hardheaded enough to be practical about the situation and no one would ever know how she felt How surprised the bazaar would be if they knew what she really was thinking How shocked if she suddenly climbed on the bandstand and declared that she thought the war ought to stop so everybody could go home and tend to their cotton and there could be parties and beaux again and plenty of pale green dresses For a moment her selfjustification buoyed her up but still she looked about the hall with distaste The McLure girls booth was inconspicuous as Mrs Merriwether had said and there were long intervals when no one came to their corner and Scarlett had nothing to do but look enviously on the happy throng Melanie sensed her moodiness but crediting it to longing for Charlie did not try to engage her in conversation She busied herself arranging the articles in the booth in more attractive display while Scarlett sat and looked glumly around the room Even the banked flowers below the pictures of Mr Davis and Mr Stephens displeased her It looks like an altar she sniffed And the way they all carry on about those two they might as well be the Father and the Son Then smitten with sudden fright at her irreverence she began hastily to cross herself by way of apology but caught herself in time Well its true she argued with her conscience Everybody carries on like they were holy and they arent anything but men and mighty unattractive looking ones at that Of course Mr Stephens couldnt help how he looked for he had been an invalid all his life but Mr Davis She looked up at the cameo clean proud face It was his goatee that annoyed her the most Men should either be clean shaven mustached or wear  Page    Gone With The Wind full beards That little wisp looks like it was just the best he could do she thought not seeing in his face the cold hard intelligence that was carrying the weight of a new nation No she was not happy now and at first she had been radiant with the pleasure of being in a crowd Now just being present was not enough She was at the bazaar but not a part of it No one paid her any attention and she was the only young unmarried woman present who did not have a beau And all her life she had enjoyed the center of the stage It wasnt fair She was seventeen years old and her feet were patting the floor wanting to skip and dance She was seventeen years old and she had a husband lying at Oakland Cemetery and a baby in his cradle at Aunt Pittypats and everyone thought she should be content with her lot She had a whiter bosom and a smaller waist and a tinier foot than any girl present but for all they mattered she might just as well be lying beside Charles with Beloved Wife of carved over her She wasnt a girl who could dance and flirt and she wasnt a wife who could sit with other wives and criticize the dancing and flirting girls And she wasnt old enough to be a widow Widows should be oldso terribly old they didnt want to dance and flirt and be admired Oh it wasnt fair that she should have to sit here primly and be the acme of widowed dignity and propriety when she was only seventeen It wasnt fair that she must keep her voice low and her eyes cast modestly down when men attractive ones too came to their booth Every girl in Atlanta was three deep in men Even the plainest girls were carrying on like bellesand oh worst of all they were carrying on in such lovely lovely dresses Here she sat like a crow with hot black taffeta to her wrists and buttoned up to her chin with not even a hint of lace or braid not a jewel except Ellens onyx mourning brooch watching tackylooking girls hanging on the arms of goodlooking men All because Charles Hamilton had had the measles He didnt even die in a fine glow of gallantry in battle so she could brag about him Rebelliously she leaned her elbows on the counter and looked at the crowd flouting Mammys oftrepeated admonition against leaning on elbows and making them ugly and wrinkled What did it matter if they did get ugly Shed probably never get a chance to show them again She looked hungrily at the frocks floating by butteryellow watered silks with garlands of rosebuds pink satins with eighteen flounces edged with tiny black velvet ribbons baby blue taffeta ten yards in the skirt and foamy with cascading lace exposed bosoms seductive flowers Maybelle Merriwether went toward the next booth on the arm of the Zouave in an applegreen tarlatan so wide that it reduced her waist to nothingness It Was showered and flounced with creamcolored Chantilly lace that had come from Charleston on the last blockader and Maybelle was flaunting it as saucily as if she and not the famous Captain Butler had run the blockade How sweet Id look in that dress thought Scarlett a savage envy in her heart Her waist is as big as a cows That green is just my color and it would make my eyes look Why will blondes try to wear that color Her skin looks as green as an old cheese And to think Ill never wear that color again not even when I do get out of mourning No not even if I do manage to get married again Then Ill have to wear tacky old grays and tans and lilacs For a brief moment she considered the unfairness of it all How short was the time for fun for pretty clothes for dancing for coquetting Only a few too few years Then you married and wore dullcolored dresses and had babies that ruined your waist line and sat in corners at dances with other sober matrons and only emerged to dance with your husband or with old gentlemen who stepped on your feet If you didnt do these things the other matrons talked about you and then your reputation was ruined and your family disgraced It seemed such a terrible waste to spend all your little girlhood learning how to be attractive and how to catch men and then only use the knowledge for a year or two When she considered her training at the hands of Ellen and Mammy she knew it had been thorough and good because it had always reaped results There were set rules to be followed and if you followed them success crowned your efforts With old ladies you were sweet and guileless and appeared as simple minded as possible for old ladies were sharp and they watched girls as jealously as cats ready to pounce on any indiscretion of tongue or eye With old gentlemen a girl was pert and saucy and almost but not quite flirtatious so that the old fools vanities would be tickled It made them feel devilish and young and they pinched your cheek and declared you Were a minx And of course you always blushed on such occasions otherwise they would pinch you with more pleasure than was proper and then tell their sons that you were fast With young girls and young married women you slopped over with sugar and kissed them every time you met them even if it was ten times a day And you put your arms about their waists and suffered them to do the same to you no matter how much you disliked it You admired their frocks or their babies indiscriminately and teased about beaux and complimented husbands and giggled modestly and denied that you had any charms at all compared with theirs And above all you never said what you really thought about anything any more than they said what they really thought Other womens husbands you let severely alone even if they were your own discarded beaux and no matter how temptingly attractive they were If you were too nice to young husbands their wives said you were fast and you got a bad reputation and never caught any beaux of your own But with young bachelorsah that was a different matter You could laugh softly at them and when they came flying to see why you laughed you could refuse to tell them and laugh harder and keep them around indefinitely trying to find out You could promise with your eyes any number of exciting things that would make a man maneuver to get you alone And having gotten you alone you could be very very hurt or very very angry when he tried to kiss you You could make him apologize for being a cur and forgive him so sweetly that he would hang around trying to kiss you a second time Sometimes but not often you did let him kiss you Ellen and Mammy had not taught her that but she learned it was effective Then you cried and declared you didnt know what had come over you and that he couldnt ever respect you again Then he had to dry your eyes and usually he proposed to show just how much he did respect you And then there were Oh there were so many things to do to bachelors and she knew them all the nuance of the sidelong glance the halfsmile behind the fan the swaying of the hips so that skirts swung like a bell the tears the laughter the flattery the sweet sympathy Oh all the tricks that never failed to workexcept with Ashley No it didnt seem right to learn all these smart tricks use them so briefly and then put them away forever How wonderful it  Page    Gone With The Wind would be never to marry but to go on being lovely in pale green dresses and forever courted by handsome men But if you went on too long you got to be an old maid like India Wilkes and everyone said poor thing in that smug hateful way No after all it was better to marry and keep your selfrespect even if you never had any more fun Oh what a mess life was Why had she been such an idiot as to marry Charles of all people and have her life end at sixteen Her indignant and hopeless reverie was broken when the crowd began pushing back against the walls the ladies carefully holding their hoops so that no careless contact should turn them up against their bodies and show more pantalets than was proper Scarlett tiptoed above the crowd and saw the captain of the militia mounting the orchestra platform He shouted orders and half of the Company fell into line For a few minutes they went through a brisk drill that brought perspiration to their foreheads and cheers and applause from the audience Scarlett clapped her hands dutifully with the rest and as the soldiers pushed forward toward the punch and lemonade booths after they were dismissed she turned to Melanie feeling that she had better begin her deception about the Cause as soon as possible They looked fine didnt they she said Melanie was fussing about with the knitted things on the counter Most of them would look a lot finer in gray uniforms and in Virginia she said and she did not trouble to lower her voice Several of the proud mothers of members of the militia were standing close by and overheard the remark Mrs Guinan turned scarlet and then white for her twentyfiveyearold Willie was in the company Scarlett was aghast at such words coming from Melly of all people Why Melly You know its true Scarlet I dont mean the little boys and the old gentlemen But a lot of the militia are perfectly able to tote a rifle and thats what they ought to be doing this minute Butbut began Scarlett who had never considered the matter before Somebodys got to stay home to What was it Willie Guinan had told her by way of excusing his presence in Atlanta Somebodys got to stay home to protect the state from invasion Nobodys invading us and nobodys going to said Melly coolly looking toward a group of the militia And the best way to keep out invaders is to go to Virginia and beat the Yankees there And as for all this talk about the militia staying here to keep the darkies from risingwhy its the silliest thing I ever heard of Why should our people rise Its just a good excuse for cowards Ill bet we could lick the Yankees in a month if all the militia of all the states went to Virginia So there Why Melly cried Scarlett again staring Mellys soft dark eyes were flashing angrily My husband wasnt afraid to go and neither was yours And Id rather theyd both be dead than here at home Oh darling Im sorry How thoughtless and cruel of me She stroked Scarletts arm appealingly and Scarlett stared at her But it was not of dead Charles she was thinking It was of Ashley Suppose he too were to die She turned quickly and smiled automatically as Dr Meade walked up to their booth Well girls he greeted them it was nice of you to come I know what a sacrifice it must have been for you to come out tonight But its all for the Cause And Im going to tell you a secret Ive a surprise way for making some more money tonight for the hospital but Im afraid some of the ladies are going to be shocked about it He stopped and chuckled as he tugged at his gray goatee Oh what Do tell On second thought I believe Ill keep you guessing too But you girls must stand up for me if the church members want to run me out of town for doing it However its for the hospital Youll see Nothing like this has ever been done before He went off pompously toward a group of chaperons in one corner and just as the two girls had turned to each other to discuss the possibilities of the secret two old gentlemen bore down on the booth declaring in loud voices that they wanted ten miles of tatting Well after all old gentlemen were better than no gentlemen at all thought Scarlett measuring out the tatting and submitting demurely to being chucked under the chin The old blades charged off toward the lemonade booth and others took their places at the counter Their booth did not have so many customers as did the other booths where the tootling laugh of Maybelle Merriwether sounded and Fanny Elsings giggles and the Whiting girls repartee made merriment Melly sold useless stuff to men who could have no possible use for it as quietly and serenely as a shopkeeper and Scarlett patterned her conduct on Mellys There were crowds in front of every other counter but theirs girls chattering men buying The few who came to them talked about how they went to the university with Ashley and what a fine soldier he was or spoke in respectful tones of Charles and how great a loss to Atlanta his death had been Then the music broke into the rollicking strains of Johnny Booker hep dis Nigger and Scarlett thought she would scream She wanted to dance She wanted to dance She looked across the floor and tapped her foot to the music and her green eyes blazed so eagerly that they fairly snapped All the way across the floor a man newly come and standing in the doorway saw them started in recognition and watched closely the slanting eyes in the sulky rebellious face Then he grinned to himself as he recognized the invitation that any male could read He was dressed in black broadcloth a tall man towering over the officers who stood near him bulky in the shoulders but tapering to a small waist and absurdly small feet in varnished boots His severe black suit with fine ruffled shirt and trousers smartly strapped beneath high insteps was oddly at variance with his physique and face for he was foppishly groomed the clothes of a dandy on a body that was powerful and latently dangerous in its lazy grace His hair was jet black and his black mustache was small and closely clipped almost foreign looking compared with the dashing swooping mustaches of the caval rymen near by He looked and was a man of lusty and unashamed appetites He had an air of utter assurance of displeasing insolence about him and there was a twinkle of malice in his bold eyes as he stared at Scarlett until finally feeling his gaze she looked toward him Somewhere in her mind the bell of recognition rang but for the moment she could not recall who he was But he was the first man in months who had displayed an interest in her and she threw him a gay smile She made a little curtsy as he bowed and then  Page    Gone With The Wind as he straightened and started toward her with a peculiarly lithe Indianlike gait her hand went to her mouth in horror for she knew who he was Thunderstruck she stood as if paralyzed while he made his way through the crowd Then she turned blindly bent on flight into the refreshment rooms but her skirt caught on a nail of the booth She jerked furiously at it tearing it and in an instant he was beside her Permit me he Said bending over and disentangling the flounce I hardly hoped that you would recall me Miss OHara His voice was oddly pleasant to the ear the wellmodulated voice of a gentleman resonant and overlaid with the flat slow drawl of the Charlestonian She looked up at him imploringly her face crimson with the shame of their last meeting and met two of the blackest eyes she had ever seen dancing in merciless merriment Of all the people in the world to turn up here this terrible person who had witnessed that scene with Ashley which still gave her nightmares this odious wretch who ruined girls and was not received by nice people this despicable man who had said and with good cause that she was not a lady At the sound of his voice Melanie turned and for the first time in her life Scarlett thanked God for the existence of her sisterinlaw Whyitsits Mr Rhett Butler isnt it said Melanie with a little smile putting out her hand I met you On the happy occasion of the announcement of your betrothal he finished bending over her hand It is kind of you to recall me And what are you doing so far from Charleston Mr Butler A boring matter of business Mrs Wilkes I will be in and out of your town from now on I find I must not only bring in goods but see to the disposal of them Bring in began Melly her brow wrinkling and then she broke into a delighted smile Why youyou must be the famous Captain Butler weve been hearing so much aboutthe blockade runner Why every girl here is wearing dresses you brought in Scarlett arent you thrilledwhats the matter dear Are you faint Do sit down Scarlett sank to the stool her breath coming so rapidly she feared the lacings of her stays would burst Oh what a terrible thing to happen She had never thought to meet this man again He picked up her black fan from the counter and began fanning her solicitously too solicitously his face grave but his eyes still dancing It is quite warm in here he said No wonder Miss OHara is faint May I lead you to a window No said Scarlett so rudely that Melly stared She is not Miss OHara any longer said Melly She is Mrs Hamilton She is my sister now and Melly bestowed one of her fond little glances on her Scarlett felt that she would strangle at the expression on Captain Butlers swarthy piratical face I am sure that is a great gain to two charming ladies said he making a slight bow That was the kind of remark all men made but when he said it it seemed to her that he meant just the opposite Your husbands are here tonight I trust on this happy occasion It would be a pleasure to renew acquaintances My husband is in Virginia said Melly with a proud lift of her head But Charles Her voice broke He died in camp said Scarlett flatly She almost snapped the words Would this creature never go away Melly looked at her startled and the Captain made a gesture of selfreproach My dear ladieshow could I You must forgive me But permit a stranger to offer the comfort of saying that to die for ones country is to live forever Melanie smiled at him through sparkling tears while Scarlett felt the fox of wrath and impotent hate gnaw at her vitals Again he had made a graceful remark the kind of compliment any gentleman would pay under such circumstances but he did not mean a word of it He was jeering at her He knew she hadnt loved Charles And Melly was just a big enough fool not to see through him Oh please God dont let anybody else see through him she thought with a start of terror Would he tell what he knew Of course he wasnt a gentleman and there was no telling what men would do when they werent gentlemen There was no standard to judge them by She looked up at him and saw that his mouth was pulled down at the corners in mock sympathy even while he swished the fan Something in his look challenged her spirit and brought her strength back in a surge of dislike Abruptly she snatched the fan from his hand Im quite all right she said tartly Theres no need to blow my hair out of place Scarlett darling Captain Butler you must forgive her Sheshe isnt herself when she hears poor Charlies name spokenand perhaps after all we shouldnt have come here tonight Were still in mourning you see and its quite a strain on herall this gaiety and music poor child I quite understand he said with elaborate gravity but as he turned and gave Melanie a searching look that went to the bottom of her sweet worried eyes his expression changed reluctant respect and gentleness coming over his dark face I think youre a courageous little lady Mrs Wilkes Not a word about me thought Scarlett indignantly as Melly smiled in confusion and answered Dear me no Captain Butler The hospital committee just had to have us for this booth because at the last minute A pillow case Heres a lovely one with a flag on it She turned to three cavalrymen who appeared at her counter For a moment Melanie thought how nice Captain Butler was Then she wished that something more substantial than cheesecloth was between her skirt and the spittoon that stood just outside the booth for the aim of the horsemen with amber streams of tobacco juice was not so unerring as with their long horse pistols Then she forgot about the Captain Scarlett and the spittoons as more customers crowded to her Scarlett sat quietly on the stool fanning herself not daring to look up wishing Captain Butler back on the deck of his ship where he belonged Your husband has been dead long Oh yes a long time Almost a year An aeon Im sure  Page    Gone With The Wind Scarlett was not sure what an aeon was but there was no mistaking the baiting quality of his voice so she said nothing Had you been married long Forgive my questions but I have been away from this section for so long Two months said Scarlett unwillingly A tragedy no less his easy voice continued Oh damn him she thought violently If he was any other man in the world I could simply freeze up and order him off But he knows about Ashley and he knows I didnt love Charlie And my hands are tied She said nothing still looking down at her fan And this is your first social appearance I know it looks quite odd she explained rapidly But the McLure girls who were to take this booth were called away and there was no one else so Melanie and I No sacrifice is too great for the Cause Why that was what Mrs Elsing had said but when she said it it didnt sound the same way Hot words started to her lips but she choked them back After all she was here not for the Cause but because she was tired of sitting home I have always thought he said reflectively that the system of mourning of immuring women in crpe for the rest of their lives and forbidding them normal enjoyment is just as barbarous as the Hindu suttee Settee He laughed and she blushed for her ignorance She hated people who used words unknown to her In India when a man dies he is burned instead of buried and his wife always climbs on the funeral pyre and is burned with him How dreadful Why do they do it Dont the police do anything about it Of course not A wife who didnt burn herself would be a social outcast All the worthy Hindu matrons would talk about her for not behaving as a wellbred lady shouldprecisely as those worthy matrons in the corner would talk about you should you appear tonight in a red dress and lead a reel Personally I think suttee much more merciful than our charming Southern custom of burying widows alive How dare you say Im buried alive How closely women clutch the very chains that bind them You think the Hindu custom barbarousbut would you have had the courage to appear here tonight if the Confederacy hadnt needed you Arguments of this character were always confusing to Scarlett His were doubly confusing because she had a vague idea there was truth in them But now was the time to squelch him Of course I wouldnt have come It would have beenwell disrespectful toit would have seemed as if I hadnt lov His eyes waited on her words cynical amusement in them and she could not go on He knew she hadnt loved Charlie and he wouldnt let her pretend to the nice polite sentiments that she should express What a terrible terrible thing it was to have to do with a man who wasnt a gentleman A gentleman always appeared to believe a lady even when he knew she was lying That was Southern chivalry A gentleman always obeyed the rules and said the correct things and made life easier for a lady But this man seemed not to care for rules and evidently enjoyed talking of things no one ever talked about I am waiting breathlessly I think you are horrid she said helplessly dropping her eyes He leaned down across the counter until his mouth was near her ear and hissed in a very creditable imitation of the stage villains who appeared infrequently at the Athenaeum Hall Fear not fair lady Your guilty secret is safe with me Oh she whispered feverishly how can you say such things I only thought to ease your mind What would you have me say Be mine beautiful female or I will reveal all  She met his eyes unwillingly and saw they were as teasing as a small boys Suddenly she laughed It was such a silly situation after all He laughed too and so loudly that several of the chaperons in the corner looked their way Observing how good a time Charles Hamiltons widow appeared to be having with a perfect stranger they put their heads together disapprovingly There was a roll of drums and many voices cried Sh as Dr Meade mounted the platform and spread out his arms for quiet We must all give grateful thanks to the charming ladies whose indefatigable and patriotic efforts have made this bazaar not only a pecuniary success he began but have transformed this rough hall into a bower of loveliness a fit garden for the charming rosebuds I see about me Everyone clapped approvingly The ladies have given their best not only of their time but of the labor of their hands and these beautiful objects in the booths are doubly beautiful made as they are by the fair hands of our charming Southern women There were more shouts of approval and Rhett Butler who had been lounging negligently against the counter at Scarletts side whispered Pompous goat isnt he Startled at first horrified at this lese majesty toward Atlantas most beloved citizen she stared reprovingly at him But the doctor did look like a goat with his gray chin whiskers wagging away at a great rate and with difficulty she stifled a giggle But these things are not enough The good ladies of the hospital committee whose cool hands have soothed many a suffering brow and brought back from the jaws of death our brave men wounded in the bravest of all Causes know our needs I will not enumerate them We must have more money to buy medical supplies from England and we have with us tonight the intrepid captain who has so successfully run the blockade for a year and who will run it again to bring us the drugs we need Captain Rhett Butler Though caught unawares the blockader made a graceful bowtoo graceful thought Scarlett trying to analyze it It was almost as if he overdid his courtesy because his contempt for everybody present was so great There was a loud burst of applause as he bowed and a craning of necks from the ladies in the corner So that was who poor Charles Hamiltons widow was carrying on with And Charlie hardly dead a year We need more gold and I am asking you for it the doctor continued I am asking a sacrifice but a sacrifice so small  Page    Gone With The Wind compared with the sacrifices our gallant men in gray are making that it will seem laughably small Ladies I want your jewelry I want your jewelry No the Confederacy wants your jewelry the Confederacy calls for it and I know no one will hold back How fair a gem gleams on a lovely wrist How beautifully gold brooches glitter on the bosoms of our patriotic women But how much more beautiful is sacrifice than all the gold and gems of the Ind The gold will be melted and the stones sold and the money used to buy drugs and other medical supplies Ladies there will pass among you two of our gallant wounded with baskets and But the rest of his speech was lost in the storm and tumult of clapping hands and cheering voices Scarletts first thought was one of deep thankfulness that mourning forbade her wearing her precious earbobs arid the heavy gold chain that had been Grandma Robillards and the gold and black enameled bracelets and the garnet brooch She saw the little Zouave a splitoak basket over his unwounded arm making the rounds of the crowd on her side of the hall and saw women old and young laughing eager tugging at bracelets squealing in pretended pain as earrings came from pierced flesh helping each other undo stiff necklace clasps unpinning brooches from bosoms There was a steady little dinkclink of metal on metal and cries of Waitwait Ive got it unfastened now There Maybelle Merriwether was pulling off her lovely twin bracelets from above and below her elbows Fanny Elsing crying Mamma may I was tearing from her curls the seedpearl ornament set in heavy gold which had been in the family for generations As each offering went into the basket there was applause and cheering The grinning little man was coming to their booth now his basket heavy on his arm and as he passed Rhett Butler a handsome gold cigar case was thrown carelessly into the basket When he came to Scarlett and rested his basket upon the counter she shook her head throwing wide her hands to show that she had nothing to give It was embarrassing to be the only person present who was giving nothing And then she saw the bright gleam of her wide gold wedding ring For a confused moment she tried to remember Charles facehow he had looked when he slipped it en her finger But the memory was blurred blurred by the sadden feeling of irritation that memory of him always brought to her Charleshe was the reason why life was over for her why she was an old woman With a sudden wrench she seized the ring but it stuck The Zouave was moving toward Melanie Wait cried Scarlett I have something for you The ring came off and as she started to throw it into the basket heaped up with chains watches rings pins and bracelets she caught Rhett Butlers eye His lips were twisted in a slight smile Defiantly she tossed the ring onto the top of the pile Oh my darling whispered Melly clutching her arm her eyes blazing with love and pride You brave brave girl Waitplease wait Lieutenant Picard I have something for you too She was tugging at her own wedding ring the ring Scarlett knew had never once left that finger since Ashley put it there Scarlett knew as no one did how much it meant to her It came off with difficulty and for a brief instant was clutched tightly in the small palm Then it was laid gently on the pile of jewelry The two girls stood looking after the Zouave who was moving toward the group of elderly ladies in the corner Scarlett defiant Melanie with a look more pitiful than tears And neither expression was lost on the man who stood beside them If you hadnt been brave enough to do it I would never have been either said Melly putting her arm about Scarletts waist and giving her a gentle squeeze For a moment Scarlett wanted to shake her off and cry Name of God at the top of her lungs as Gerald did when he was irritated but she caught Rhett Butlers eye and managed a very sour smile It was annoying the way Melly always misconstrued her motivesbut perhaps that was far preferable to having her suspect the truth What a beautiful gesture said Rhett Butler softly It is such sacrifices as yours that hearten our brave lads in gray Hot words bubbled to her lips and it was with difficulty that she checked them There was mockery in everything he said She disliked him heartily lounging there against the booth But there was something stimulating about him something warm and vital and electric All that was Irish in her rose to the challenge of his black eyes She decided she was going to take this man down a notch or two His knowledge of her secret gave him an advantage over her that was exasperating so she would have to change that by putting him at a disadvantage somehow She stifled her impulse to tell him exactly what she thought of him Sugar always caught more flies than vinegar as Mammy often said and she was going to catch and subdue this fly so he could never again have her at his mercy Thank you she said sweetly deliberately misunderstanding his jibe A compliment like that coming from so famous a man as Captain Butler is appreciated He threw back his head and laughed freelyyelped was what Scarlett thought fiercely her face becoming pink again Why dont you say what you really think he demanded lowering his voice so that in the clatter and excitement of the collection it came only to her ears Why dont you say Im a damned rascal and no gentleman and that I must take myself off or youll have one of these gallant boys in gray call me out It was on the tip of her tongue to answer tartly but she managed by heroic control to say Why Captain Butler How you do run on As if everybody didnt know how famous you are and how brave and what awhat a I am disappointed in you he said Disappointed Yes On the occasion of our first eventful meeting I thought to myself that I had at last met a girl who was not only beautiful but who had courage And now I see that you are only beautiful Do you mean to call me a coward She was ruffling like a hen Exactly You lack the courage to say what you really think When I first met you I thought There is a girl in a million She isnt like these other silly little fools who believe everything their mammas tell them and act on it no matter how they feel And conceal all their feelings and desires and little heartbreaks behind a lot of sweet words I thought Miss OHara is a girl of rare spirit She knows what she wants and she doesnt mind speaking her mindor throwing vases Oh she said rage breaking through Then Ill speak my mind right this minute If youd had any raising at all youd never have come over here and talked to me Youd have known I never wanted to lay eyes on you again But you arent a gentleman You are just a nasty illbred creature And you think that because your rotten little boats can outrun the Yankees youve the right to come here and jeer at men who are brave and women who are sacrificing everything for the Cause  Page    Gone With The Wind Stop stop he begged with a grin You started off very nicely and said what you thought but dont begin talking to me about the Cause Im tired of hearing about it and Ill bet you are too Why how did she began caught off her balance and then checked herself hastily boiling with anger at herself for falling into his trap I stood there in the doorway before you saw me and I watched you he said And I watched the other girls And they all looked as though their faces came out of one mold Yours didnt You have an easy face to read You didnt have your mind on your business and Ill wager you werent thinking about our Cause or the hospital It was all over your face that you wanted to dance and have a good time and you couldnt So you were mad clean through Tell the truth Am I not right I have nothing more to say to you Captain Butler she said as formally as she could trying to draw the rags of her dignity about her Just because youre conceited at being the great blockader doesnt give you the right to insult women The great blockader Thats a joke Pray give me only one moment more of your precious time before you cast me into darkness I wouldnt want so charming a little patriot to be left under a misapprehension about my contribution to the Confederate Cause I dont care to listen to your brags Blockading is a business with me and Im making money out of it When I stop making money out of it Ill quit What do you think of that I think youre a mercenary rascaljust like the Yankees Exactly he grinned And the Yankees help me make my money Why last month I sailed my boat right into New York harbor and took on a cargo What cried Scarlett interested and excited in spite of herself Didnt they shell you My poor innocent Of course not There are plenty of sturdy Union patriots who are not averse to picking up money selling goods to the Confederacy I run my boat into New York buy from Yankee firms sub rosa of course and away I go And when that gets a bit dangerous I go to Nassau where these same Union patriots have brought powder and shells and hoop skirts for me Its more convenient than going to England Sometimes its a bit difficult running it into Charleston or Wilmingtonbut youd be surprised how far a little gold goes Oh I knew Yankees were vile but I didnt know Why quibble about the Yankees earning an honest penny selling out the Union It wont matter in a hundred years The result will be the same They know the Confederacy will be licked eventually so why shouldnt they cash in on it Lickedus Of course Will you please leave meor will it be necessary for me to call my carriage and go home to get rid of you A redhot little Rebel he said with another sudden grin He bowed and sauntered off leaving her with her bosom heaving with impotent rage and indignation There was disappointment burning in her that she could not quite analyze the disappointment of a child seeing illusions crumble How dared he take the glamour from the blockaders And how dared he say the Confederacy would be licked He should be shot for thatshot like a traitor She looked about the hall at the familiar faces so assured of success so brave so devoted and somehow a cold little chill set in at her heart Licked These peoplewhy of course not The very idea was impossible disloyal What were you two whispering about asked Melanie turning to Scarlett as her customers drifted off I couldnt help seeing that Mrs Merriwether had her eye on you all the time and dear you know how she talks Oh the mans impossiblean illbred boor said Scarlett And as for old lady Merriwether let her talk Im sick of acting like a ninny just for her benefit Why Scarlett cried Melanie scandalized Shsh said Scarlett Dr Meade is going to make another announcement The gathering quieted again as the doctor raised his voice at first in thanks to the ladies who had so willingly given their jewelry And now ladies and gentlemen I am going to propose a surprisean innovation that may shock some of you but I ask you to remember that all this is done for the hospital and for the benefit of our boys lying there Everyone edged forward in anticipation trying to imagine what the sedate doctor could propose that would be shocking The dancing is about to begin and the first number will of course be a reel followed by a waltz The dances following the polkas the schottisches the mazurkas will be preceded by short reels I know the gentle rivalry to lead the reels very well and so The doctor mopped his brow and cast a quizzical glance at the corner where his wife sat among the chaperons Gentlemen if you wish to lead a reel with the lady of your choice you must bargain for her I will be auctioneer and the proceeds will go to the hospital Fans stopped in midswish and a ripple of excited murmuring ran through the hall The chaperons corner was in tumult and Mrs Meade anxious to support her husband in an action of which she heartily disapproved was at a disadvantage Mrs Elsing Mrs Merriwether and Mrs Whiting were red with indignation But suddenly the Home Guard gave a cheer and it was taken up by the other uniformed guests The young girls clapped their hands and jumped excitedly Dont you think itsits justjust a little like a slave auction whispered Melanie staring uncertainly at the embattled doctor who heretofore had been perfect in her eyes Scarlett said nothing but her eyes glittered and her heart contracted with a little pain If only she were not a widow If only she were Scarlett OHara again out there on the floor in an applegreen dress with darkgreen velvet ribbons dangling from her bosom and tuberoses in her black hairshed lead that reel Yes indeed Thered be a dozen men battling for her and paying over money to the doctor Oh to have to sit here a wallflower against her will and see Fanny or Maybelle lead the first reel as the belle of Atlanta Above the tumult sounded the voice of the little Zouave his Creole accent very obvious Eef I maytwenty dollars for Mees  Page    Gone With The Wind Maybelle Merriwether Maybelle collapsed with blushes against Fannys shoulder and the two girls hid their faces in each others necks and giggled as other voices began calling other names other amounts of money Dr Meade had begun to smile again ignoring completely the indignant whispers that came from the Ladies Hospital Committee in the corner At first Mrs Merriwether had stated flatly and loudly that her Maybelle would never take part In such a proceeding but as Maybelles name was called most often and the amount went up to seventyfive dollars her protests began to dwindle Scarlett leaned her elbows on the counter and almost glared at the excited laughing crowd surging about the platform their hands full of Confederate paper money Now they would all danceexcept her and the old ladies Now everyone would have a good time except her She saw Rhett Butler standing just below the doctor and before she could change the expression of her face he saw her and one corner of his mouth went down and one eyebrow went up She jerked her chin up and turned away from him and suddenly she heard her own name calledcalled in an unmistakable Charleston voice that rang out above the hubbub of other names Mrs Charles Hamiltonone hundred and fifty dollarsin gold A sudden hush fell on the crowd both at the mention of the sum and at the name Scarlett was so startled she could not even move She remained sitting with her chin in her hands her eyes wide with astonishment Everybody turned to look at her She saw the doctor lean down from the platform and whisper something to Rhett Butler Probably telling him she was in mourning and it was impossible for her to appear on the floor She saw Rhetts shoulders shrug lazily Another one of our belles perhaps questioned the doctor No said Rhett clearly his eyes sweeping the crowd carelessly Mrs Hamilton I tell you it is impossible said the doctor testily Mrs Hamilton will not Scarlett heard a voice which at first she did not recognize as her own Yes I will She leaped to her feet her heart hammering so wildly she feared she could not stand hammering with the thrill of being the center of attention again of being the most highly desired girl present and oh best of all at the prospect of dancing again Oh I dont care I dont care what they say she whispered as a sweet madness swept over her She tossed her head and sped out of the booth tapping her heels like castanets snapping open her black silk fan to its widest For a fleeting instant she saw Melanies incredulous face the look on the chaperons faces the petulant girls the enthusiastic approval of the soldiers Then she was on the floor and Rhett Butler was advancing toward her through the aisle of the crowd that nasty mocking smile on his face But she didnt caredidnt care if he were Abe Lincoln himself She was going to dance again She was going to lead the reel She swept him a low curtsy and a dazzling smile and he bowed one hand on his frilled bosom Levi horrified was quick to cover the situation and bawled Choose yo padners fo de Ferginny reel And the orchestra crashed into that best of all reel tunes Dixie How dare you make me so conspicuous Captain Butler But my dear Mrs Hamilton you so obviously wanted to be conspicuous How could you call my name out in front of everybody You could have refused ButI owe it to the CauseII couldnt think of myself when you were offering so much in gold Stop laughing everyone is looking at us They will look at us anyway Dont try to palm off that twaddle about the Cause to me You wanted to dance and I gave you the opportunity This march is the last figure of the reel isnt it Yesreally I must stop and sit down now Why Have I stepped on your feet Nobut theyll talk about me Do you really caredown in your heart Well You arent committing any crime are you Why not dance the waltz with me But if Mother ever Still tied to mammas apronstrings Oh you have the nastiest way of making virtues sound so stupid But virtues are stupid Do you care if people talk Nobutwell lets dont talk about it Thank goodness the waltz is beginning Reels always leave me breathless Dont dodge my questions Has what other women said ever mattered to you Oh if youre going to pin me downno But a girl is supposed to mind Tonight though I dont care Bravo Now you are beginning to think for yourself instead of letting others think for you Thats the beginning of wisdom Oh but When youve been talked about as much as I have youll realize how little it matters Just think theres not a home in Charleston where I am received Not even my contribution to our just and holy Cause lifts the ban How dreadful Oh not at all Until youve lost your reputation you never realize what a burden it was or what freedom really is You do talk scandalous Scandalously and truly Always providing you have enough courageor moneyyou can do without a reputation Money cant buy everything Someone must have told you that Youd never think of such a platitude all by yourself What cant it buy Oh well I dont knownot happiness or love anyway  Page    Gone With The Wind Generally it can And when it cant it can buy some of the most remarkable substitutes And have you so much money Captain Butler What an illbred question Mrs Hamilton Im surprised But yes For a young man cut off without a shilling in early youth Ive done very well And Im sure Ill clean up a million on the blockade Oh no Oh yes What most people dont seem to realize is that there is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a civilization as from the upbuilding of one And what does all that mean Your family and my family and everyone here tonight made their money out of changing a wilderness into a civilization Thats empire building Theres good money in empire building But theres more in empire wrecking What empire are you talking about This empire were living inthe Souththe Confederacythe Cotton Kingdomits breaking up right under our feet Only most fools wont see it and take advantage of the situation created by the collapse Im making my fortune out of the wreckage Then you really think were going to get licked Yes Why be an ostrich Oh dear it bores me to talk about such like Dont you ever say pretty things Captain Butler Would it please you if I said your eyes were twin goldfish bowls filled to the brim with the clearest green water and that when the fish swim to the top as they are doing now you are devilishly charming Oh I dont like that  Isnt the music gorgeous Oh I could waltz forever I didnt know I had missed it so You are the most beautiful dancer Ive ever held in my arms Captain Butler you must not hold me so tightly Everybody is looking If no one were looking would you care Captain Butler you forget yourself Not for a minute How could I with you in my arms  What is that tune Isnt it new Yes Isnt it divine Its something we captured from the Yankees Whats the name of it  When This Cruel War Is Over  What are the words Sing them to me Dearest one do you remember When we last did meet When you told me how you loved me Kneeling at my feet Oh how proud you stood before me In your suit of gray When you vowed from me and country Neer to go astray Weeping sad and lonely Sighs and tears how vain When this cruel war is over Pray that we meet again Of course it was suit of blue but we changed it to gray  Oh you waltz so well Captain Butler Most big men dont you know And to think it will be years and years before Ill dance again It will only be a few minutes Im going to bid you in for the next reeland the next and the next Oh no I couldnt You mustnt My reputation will be mined Its in shreds already so what does another dance matter Maybe Ill give the other boys a chance after Ive had five or six but I must have the last one Oh all right I know Im crazy but I dont care I dont care a bit what anybody says Im so tired of sitting at home Im going to dance and dance And not wear black I loathe funeral crpe Oh I couldnt take off mourningCaptain Butler you must not hold me so tightly Ill be mad at you if you do And you look gorgeous when you are mad Ill squeeze you againtherejust to see if you will really get mad You have no idea how charming you were that day at Twelve Oaks when you were mad and throwing things Oh pleasewont you forget that No it is one of my most priceless memoriesa delicately nurtured Southern belle with her Irish up You are very Irish you know Oh dear theres the end of the music and theres Aunt Pittypat coming out of the back room I know Mrs Merriwether must have told her Oh for goodness sakes lets walk over and look out the window I dont want her to catch me now Her eyes are as big as saucers  Page    Gone With The Wind CHAPTER X OVER THE WAFFLES next morning Pittypat was lachrymose Melanie was silent and Scarlett defiant I dont care if they do talk Ill bet I made more money for the hospital than any girl theremore than all the messy old stuff we sold too Oh dear what does the money matter wailed Pittypat wringing her hands I just couldnt believe my eyes and poor Charlie hardly dead a year  And that awful Captain Butler making you so conspicuous and hes a terrible terrible person Scarlett Mrs Whitings cousin Mrs Coleman whose husband came from Charleston told me about him Hes the black sheep of a lovely familyoh how could any of the Butlers ever turn out anything like him He isnt received in Charleston and he has the fastest reputation and there was something about a girlsomething so bad Mrs Coleman didnt even know what it was Oh I cant believe hes that bad said Melly gently He seemed a perfect gentleman and when you think how brave hes been running the blockade He isnt brave said Scarlett perversely pouring half a pitcher of syrup over her waffles He just does it for money He told me so He doesnt care anything about the Confederacy and he says were going to get licked But he dances divinely Her audience was speechless with horror Im tired of sitting at home and Im not going to do it any longer If they all talked about me about last night then my reputation is already gone and it wont matter what else they say It did not occur to her that the idea was Rhett Butlers It came so patly and fitted so well with what she was thinking Oh What will your mother say when she hears What will she think of me A cold qualm of guilt assailed Scarlett at the thought of Ellens consternation should she ever learn of her daughters scandalous conduct But she took heart at the thought of the twentyfive miles between Atlanta and Tara Miss Pitty certainly wouldnt tell Ellen It would put her in such a bad light as a chaperon And if Pitty didnt tattle she was safe I think said Pitty yes I think Id better write Henry a letter about itmuch as I hate itbut hes our only male relative and make him go speak reprovingly to Captain Butler Oh dear if Charlie were only alive You must never never speak to that man again Scarlett Melanie had been sitting quietly her hands in her lap her waffles cooling on her plate She arose and coming behind Scarlett put her arms about her neck Darling she said dont you get upset I understand and it was a brave thing you did last night and its going to help the hospital a lot And if anybody dares say one little word about you Ill tend to them  Aunt Pitty dont cry It has been hard on Scarlett not going anywhere Shes just a baby Her fingers played in Scarletts black hair And maybe wed all be better off if we went out occasionally to parties Maybe weve been very selfish staying here with our grief War times arent like other times When I think of all the soldiers in town who are far from home and havent any friends to call on at nightand the ones in the hospital who are well enough to be out of bed and not well enough to go back in the army Why we have been selfish We ought to have three convalescents in our house this minute like everybody else and some of the soldiers out to dinner every Sunday There Scarlett dont you fret People wont talk when they understand We know you loved Charlie Scarlett was far from fretting and Melanies soft hands in her hair were irritating She wanted to jerk her head away and say Oh fiddledeedee for the warming memory was still on her of how the Home Guard and the militia and the soldiers from the hospital had fought for her dances last night Of all the people in the world she didnt want Melly for a defender She could defend herself thank you and if the old cats wanted to squallwell she could get along without the old cats There were too many nice officers in the world for her to bother about what old women said Pittypat was dabbing at her eyes under Melanies soothing words when Prissy entered with a bulky letter Fer you Miss Melly A lil nigger boy brung it For me said Melly wondering as she ripped open the envelope Scarlett was making headway with her waffles and so noticed nothing until she heard a burst of tears from Melly and looking up saw Aunt Pittypats hand go to her heart Ashleys dead screamed Pittypat throwing her head back and letting her arms go limp Oh my God cried Scarlett her blood turning to ice water No No cried Melanie Quick Her smelling salts Scarlett There there honey do you feel better Breathe deep No its not Ashley Im so sorry I scared you I was crying because Im so happy and suddenly she opened her clenched palm and pressed some object that was in it to her lips Im so happy and burst into tears again Scarlett caught a fleeting glimpse and saw that it was a broad gold ring Read it said Melly pointing to the letter on the floor Oh how sweet how kind he is Scarlett bewildered picked up the single sheet and saw written in a black bold hand The Confederacy may need the lifeblood of its men but not yet does it demand the hearts blood of its women Accept dear Madam this token of my reverence for your courage and do not think that your sacrifice has been in vain for this ring has been redeemed at ten times its value Captain Rhett Butler Melanie slipped the ring on her finger and looked at it lovingly I told you he was a gentleman didnt I she said turning to Pittypat her smile bright through the teardrops on her face No one but a gentleman of refinement and thoughtfulness would ever have thought how it broke my heart to Ill send my gold chain instead Aunt Pittypat you must write him a note and invite him to Sunday dinner so I can thank him In the excitement neither of the others seemed to have thought that Captain Butler had not returned Scarletts ring too But she thought of it annoyed And she knew it had not been Captain Butlers refinement that had prompted so gallant a gesture It was that he intended to be asked into Pittypats house and knew unerringly how to get the invitation I was greatly disturbed to hear of your recent conduct ran Ellens letter and Scarlett who was reading it at the table scowled  Page    Gone With The Wind Bad news certainly traveled swiftly She had often heard in Charleston and Savannah that Atlanta people gossiped more and meddled in other peoples business more than any other people in the South and now she believed it The bazaar had taken place Monday night and today was only Thursday Which of the old cats had taken it upon herself to write Ellen For a moment she suspected Pittypat but immediately abandoned that thought Poor Pittypat had been quaking in her numberthree shoes for fear of being blamed for Scarletts forward conduct and would be the last to notify Ellen of her own inadequate chaperonage Probably it was Mrs Merriwether It is difficult for me to believe that you could so forget yourself and your rearing I will pass over the impropriety of your appearing publicly while in mourning realizing your warm desire to be of assistance to the hospital But to dance and with such a man as Captain Butler I have heard much of him as who has not and Pauline wrote me only last week that he is a man of bad repute and not even received by his own family in Charleston except of course by his heartbroken mother He is a thoroughly bad character who would take advantage of your youth and innocence to make you conspicuous and publicly disgrace you and your family How could Miss Pittypat have so neglected her duty to you Scarlett looked across the table at her aunt The old lady had recognized Ellens handwriting and her fat little mouth was pursed in a frightened way like a baby who fears a scolding and hopes to ward it off by tears I am heartbroken to think that you could so soon forget your rearing I have thought of calling you home immediately but will leave that to your fathers discretion He will be in Atlanta Friday to speak with Captain Butler and to escort you home I fear he will be severe with you despite my pleadings I hope and pray it was only youth and thoughtlessness that prompted such forward conduct No one can wish to serve our Cause more than I and I wish my daughters to feel the same way but to disgrace There was more in the same vein but Scarlett did not finish it For once she was thoroughly frightened She did not feel reckless and defiant now She felt as young and guilty as when she was ten and had thrown a buttered biscuit at Suellen at the table To think of her gentle mother reproving her so harshly and her father coming to town to talk to Captain Butler The real seriousness of the matter grew on her Gerald was going to be severe This was one time when she knew she couldnt wiggle out of her punishment by sitting on his knee and being sweet and pert Notnot bad news quavered Pittypat Pa is coming tomorrow and hes going to land on me like a duck on a June bug answered Scarlett dolorously Prissy find my salts fluttered Pittypat pushing back her chair from her halfeaten meal II feel faint Deys in yo skirt pocket said Prissy who had been hovering behind Scarlett enjoying the sensational drama Mist Gerald in a temper was always exciting providing his temper was not directed at her kinky head Pitty fumbled at her skirt and held the vial to her nose You all must stand by me and not leave me alone with him for one minute cried Scarlett Hes so fond of you both and if you are with me he cant fuss at me I couldnt said Pittypat weakly rising to her feet II feel ill I must go lie down I shall lie down all day tomorrow You must give him my excuses Coward thought Scarlett glowering at her Melly rallied to the defense though white and frightened at the prospect of facing the fireeating Mr OHara IllIll help you explain how you did it for the hospital Surely hell understand No he wont said Scarlett And oh I shall die if I have to go back to Tara in disgrace like Mother threatens Oh you cant go home cried Pittypat bursting into tears If you did I should be forcedyes forced to ask Henry to come live with us and you know I just couldnt live with Henry Im so nervous with just Melly in the house at night with so many strange men in town Youre so brave I dont mind being here without a man Oh he couldnt take you to Tara said Melly looking as if she too would cry in a moment This is your home now What would we ever do without you Youd be glad to do without me if you knew what I really think of you thought Scarlett sourly wishing there were some other person than Melanie to help ward off Geralds wrath It was sickening to be defended by someone you disliked so much Perhaps we should recall our invitation to Captain Butler began Pittypat Oh we couldnt It would be the height of rudeness cried Melly distressed Help me to bed Im going to be ill moaned Pittypat Oh Scarlett how could you have brought this on me Pittypat was ill and in her bed when Gerald arrived the next afternoon She sent many messages of regret to him from behind her closed door and left the two frightened girls to preside over the supper table Gerald was ominously silent although he kissed Scarlett and pinched Melanies cheek approvingly and called her Cousin Melly Scarlett would have infinitely preferred bellowing oaths and accusations True to her promise Melanie clung to Scarletts skirts like a small rustling shadow and Gerald was too much of a gentleman to upbraid his daughter in front of her Scarlett had to admit that Melanie carried off things very well acting as if she knew nothing was amiss and she actually succeeded in engaging Gerald in conversation once the supper had been served I want to know all about the County she said beaming upon him India and Honey are such poor correspondents and I know you know everything that goes on down there Do tell us about Joe Fontaines wedding Gerald warmed to the flattery and said that the wedding had been a quiet affair not like you girls had for Joe had only a few days furlough Sally the little Munroe chit looked very pretty No he couldnt recall what she wore but he did hear that she didnt have a secondday dress She didnt exclaimed the girls scandalized Sure because she didnt have a second day Gerald explained and bawled with laughter before recalling that perhaps such remarks were not fit for female ears Scarletts spirits soared at his laugh and she blessed Melanies tact Back Joe went to Virginia the next day Gerald added hastily There was no visiting about and dancing afterwards The Tarleton twins are home We heard that Have they recovered  Page    Gone With The Wind They werent badly wounded Stuart had it in the knee and a minie ball went through Brents shoulder You had it too that they were mentioned in dispatches for bravery No Tell us Hare brainedboth of them Im believing theres Irish in them said Gerald complacently I forget what they did but Brent is a lieutenant now Scarlett felt pleased at hearing of their exploits pleased in a proprietary manner Once a man had been her beau she never lost the conviction that he belonged to her and all his good deeds redounded to her credit And Ive news thatll be holding the both of you said Gerald Theyre saying Stu is courting at Twelve Oaks again Honey or India questioned Melly excitedly while Scarlett stared almost indignantly Oh Miss India to be sure Didnt she have him fast till this baggage of mine winked at him Oh said Melly somewhat embarrassed at Geralds outspokenness And more than that young Brent has taken to hanging about Tara Now Scarlett could not speak The defection of her beaux was almost insulting Especially when she recalled how wildly both the twins had acted when she told them she was going to marry Charles Stuart had even threatened to shoot Charles or Scarlett or himself or all three It had been most exciting Suellen questioned Melly breaking into a pleased smile But I thought Mr Kennedy Oh him said Gerald Frank Kennedy still pussyfoots about afraid of his shadow and Ill be asking him his intentions soon if he doesnt speak up No tis me baby Carreen Shes nothing but a child said Scarlett sharply finding her tongue Shes little more than a year younger than you were Miss when you were married retorted Gerald Is it youre grudging your old beau to your sister Melly blushed unaccustomed to such frankness and signaled Peter to bring in the sweet potato pie Frantically she cast about in her mind for some other topic of conversation which would not be so personal but which would divert Mr OHara from the purpose of his trip She could think of nothing but once started Gerald needed no stimulus other than an audience He talked on about the thievery of the commissary department which every month increased its demands the knavish stupidity of Jefferson Davis and the blackguardery of the Irish who were being enticed into the Yankee army by bounty money When the wine was on the table and the two girls rose to leave him Gerald cocked a severe eye at his daughter from under frowning brows and commanded her presence alone for a few minutes Scarlett cast a despairing glance at Melly who twisted her handkerchief helplessly and went out softly pulling the sliding doors together How now Missy bawled Gerald pouring himself a glass of port  Tis a fine way to act Is it another husband youre trying to catch and you so fresh a widow Not so loud Pa the servants They know already to be sure and everybody knows of our disgrace And your poor mother taking to her bed with it and me not able to hold up me head Tis shameful No Puss you need not think to get around me with tears this time he said hastily and with some panic in his voice as Scarletts lids began to bat and her mouth to screw up I know you Youd be flirting at the wake of your husband Dont cry There Ill be saying no more tonight for Im going to see this fine Captain Butler who makes so light of me daughters reputation But in the morning There now dont cry Twill do you no good at all at all Tis firm that I am and back to Tara youll be going tomorrow before youre disgracing the lot of us again Dont cry pet Look what Ive brought you Isnt that a pretty present See look How could you be putting so much trouble on me bringing me all the way up here when tis a busy man I am Dont cry Melanie and Pittypat had gone to sleep hours before but Scarlett lay awake in the warm darkness her heart heavy and frightened in her breast To leave Atlanta when life had just begun again and go home and face Ellen She would rather die than face her mother She wished she were dead this very minute then everyone would be sorry they had been so hateful She turned and tossed on the hot pillow until a noise far up the quiet street reached her ears It was an oddly familiar noise blurred and indistinct though it was She slipped out of bed and went to the window The street with its overarching trees was softly deeply black under a dim starstudded sky The noise came closer the sound of wheels the plod of a horses hooves and voices And suddenly she grinned for as a voice thick with brogue and whisky came to her raised in Peg in a Lowbacked Car she knew This might not be Jonesboro on Court Day but Gerald was coming home in the same condition She saw the dark bulk of a buggy stop in front of the house and indistinct figures alight Someone was with him Two figures paused at the gate and she heard the click of the latch and Geralds voice came plain Now Ill be giving you the Lament for Robert Emmet Tis a song you should be knowing me lad Ill teach It to you Id like to learn it replied his companion a hint of buried laughter in his flat drawling voice But not now Mr OHara Oh my God its that hateful Butler man thought Scarlett at first annoyed Then she took heart At least they hadnt shot each other And they must be on amicable terms to be coming home together at this hour and in this condition Sing it I will and listen you will or Ill be shooting you for the Orangeman you are Not OrangemanCharlestonian  Tis no better Tis worse I have two sisterinlaws in Charleston and I know Is he going to tell the whole neighborhood thought Scarlett panicstricken reaching for her wrapper But what could she do She couldnt go downstairs at this hour of the night and drag her father in from the street With no further warning Gerald who was hanging on the gate threw back his head and began the Lament in a roaring bass Scarlett rested her elbows on the window sill and listened grinning unwillingly It would be a beautiful song if only her father could carry a tune It was one of her favorite songs and for a moment she followed the fine melancholy of those verses beginning  Page    Gone With The Wind She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps And lovers are round her sighing The song went on and she heard stirrings in Pittypats and Mellys rooms Poor things theyd certainly be upset They were not used to fullblooded males like Gerald When the song had finished two forms merged into one came up the walk and mounted the steps A discreet knock sounded at the door I suppose I must go down thought Scarlett After all hes my father and poor Pitty would die before shed go Besides she didnt want the servants to see Gerald in his present condition And if Peter tried to put him to bed he might get unruly Pork was the only one who knew how to handle him She pinned the wrapper close about her throat lit her bedside candle and hurried down the dark stairs into the front hall Setting the candle on the stand she unlocked the door and in the wavering light she saw Rhett Butler not a ruffle disarranged supporting her small thickset father The Lament had evidently been Geralds swan song for he was frankly hanging onto his companions arm His hat was gone his crisp long hair was tumbled in a white mane his cravat was under one ear and there were liquor stains down his shirt bosom Your father I believe said Captain Butler his eyes amused in his swarthy face He took in her dishabille in one glance that seemed to penetrate through her wrapper Bring him in she said shortly embarrassed at her attire infuriated at Gerald for putting her in a position where this man could laugh at her Rhett propelled Gerald forward Shall I help you take him upstairs You cannot manage him Hes quite heavy Her mouth fell open with horror at the audacity of his proposal Just imagine what Pittypat and Melly cowering in their beds would think should Captain Butler come upstairs Mother of God no In here in the parlor on that settee The suttee did you say Ill thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head Here Now lay him down Shall I take off his boots No Hes slept in them before She could have bitten off her tongue for that slip for he laughed softly as he crossed Geralds legs Please go now He walked out into the dim hall and picked up the hat he had dropped on the doorsill I will be seeing you Sunday at dinner he said and went out closing the door noiselessly behind him Scarlett arose at fivethirty before the servants had come in from the back yard to start breakfast and slipped down the steps to the quiet lower floor Gerald was awake sitting on the sofa his hands gripping his bullet head as if he wished to crush it between his palms He looked up furtively as she entered The pain of moving his eyes was too excruciating to be borne and he groaned Wurra the day Its a fine way youve acted Pa she began in a furious whisper Coming home at such an hour and waking all the neighbors with your singing I sang Sang You woke the echoes singing the Lament   Tis nothing Im remembering The neighbors will remember it till their dying day and so will Miss Pittypat and Melanie Mother of Sorrows moaned Gerald moving a thickly furred tongue around parched lips  Tis little Im remembering after the game started Game That laddybuck Butler bragged that he was the best poker player in How much did you lose Why I won naturally A drink or two helps me game Look in your wallet As if every movement was agony Gerald removed his wallet from his coat and opened it It was empty and he looked at it in forlorn bewilderment Five hundred dollars he said And twas to buy things from the blockaders for Mrs OHara and now not even fare left to Tara As she looked indignantly at the empty purse an idea took form in Scarletts mind and grew swiftly Ill not be holding up my head in this town she began Youve disgraced us all Hold your tongue Puss Can you not see me head is bursting Coming home drunk with a man like Captain Butler and singing at the top of your lungs for everyone to hear and losing all that money The man is too clever with cards to be a gentleman He What will Mother say when she hears He looked up in sudden anguished apprehension You wouldnt be telling your mother a word and upsetting her now would you Scarlett said nothing but pursed her lips Think now how twould hurt her and her so gentle And to think Pa that you said only last night I had disgraced the family Me with my poor little dance to make money for the soldiers Oh I could cry  Page    Gone With The Wind Well dont pleaded Gerald  Twould be more than me poor head could stand and sure tis bursting now And you said that I Now Puss now Puss dont you be hurt at what your poor old father said and him not meaning a thing and not understanding a thing Sure youre a fine wellmeaning girl Im sure And wanting to take me home in disgrace Ah darling I wouldnt be doing that Twas to tease you You wont be mentioning the money to your mother and her in a flutter about expenses already No said Scarlett frankly I wont if youll let me stay here and if youll tell Mother that twas nothing but a lot of gossip from old cats Gerald looked mournfully at his daughter  Tis blackmail no less And last night was a scandal no less Well he began wheedlingly well be forgetting all that And do you think a fine pretty lady like Miss Pittypat would be having any brandy in the house The hair of the dog Scarlett turned and tiptoed through the silent hall into the dining room to get the brandy bottle that she and Melly privately called the swoon bottle because Pittypat always took a sip from it when her fluttering heart made her faintor seem to faint Triumph was written on her face and no trace of shame for her unfilial treatment of Gerald Now Ellen would be soothed with lies if any other busybody wrote her Now she could stay in Atlanta Now she could do almost as she pleased Pittypat being the weak vessel that she was She unlocked the cellaret and stood for a moment with the bottle and glass pressed to her bosom She saw a long vista of picnics by the bubbling waters of Peachtree Creek and barbecues at Stone Mountain receptions and balls afternoon danceables buggy rides and Sundaynight buffet suppers She would be there right in the heart of things right in the center of a crowd of men And men fell in love so easily after you did little things for them at the hospital She wouldnt mind the hospital so much now Men were so easily stirred when they had been ill They fell into a clever girls hand just like the ripe peaches at Tara when the trees were gently shaken She went back toward her father with me reviving liquor thanking Heaven that the famous OHara head had not been able to survive last nights bout and wondering suddenly if Rhett Butler had had anything to do with that CHAPTER XI ON AN AFTERNOON of the following week Scarlett came home from the hospital weary and indignant She was tired from standing on her feet all morning and irritable because Mrs Merriwether had scolded her sharply for sitting on a soldiers bed while she dressed his wounded arm Aunt Pitty and Melanie bonneted in their best were on the porch with Wade and Prissy ready for their weekly round of calls Scarlett asked to be excused from accompanying them and went upstairs to her room When the last sound of carriage wheels had died away and she knew the family was safely out of sight she slipped quietly into Melanies room and turned the key in the lock It was a prim virginal little room and it lay still and warm in the slanting rays of the fouroclock sun The floors were glistening and bare except for a few bright rag rugs and the white walls unornamented save for one corner which Melanie had fitted up as a shrine Here under a draped Confederate flag hung the goldhilted saber that Melanies father had carried in the Mexican War the same saber Charles had worn away to war Charles sash and pistol belt hung there too with his revolver in the holster Between the saber and the pistol was a daguerreotype of Charles himself very stiff and proud in his gray uniform his great brown eyes shining out of the frame and a shy smile on his lips Scarlett did not even glance at the picture but went unhesitatingly across the room to the square rosewood writing box that stood on the table beside the narrow bed From it she took a pack of letters tied together with a blue ribbon addressed in Ashleys hand to Melanie On the top was the letter which had come that morning and this one she opened When Scarlett first began secretly reading these letters she had been so stricken of conscience and so fearful of discovery she could hardly open the envelopes for trembling Now her nevertooscrupulous sense of honor was dulled by repetition of the offense and even fear of discovery had subsided Occasionally she thought with a sulking heart What would Mother say if she knew She knew Ellen would rather see her dead than know her guilty of such dishonor This had worried Scarlett at first for she still wanted to be like her mother in every respect But the temptation to read the letters was too great and she put the thought of Ellen out of her mind She had become adept at putting unpleasant thoughts out of her mind these days She had learned to say I wont think of this or that bothersome thought now Ill think about it tomorrow Generally when tomorrow came the thought either did not occur at all or it was so attenuated by the delay it was not very troublesome So the matter of Ashleys letters did not lie very heavily on her conscience Melanie was always generous with the letters reading parts of them aloud to Aunt Pitty and Scarlett But it was the part she did not read that tormented Scarlett that drove her to surreptitious reading of her sisterinlaws mail She had to know if Ashley had come to love his wife since marrying her She had to know if he even pretended to love her Did he address tender endearments to her What sentiments did he express and with what warmth She carefully smoothed out the letter Ashleys small even writing leaped up at her as she read My dear wife and she breathed in relief He wasnt calling Melanie Darling or Sweetheart yet My Dear wife You write me saying you are alarmed lest I be concealing my real thoughts from you and you ask me what is occupying my mind these days Mother of God thought Scarlett in a panic of guilt  Concealing his real thoughts Can Melly have read his mind Or my mind Does she suspect that he and I Her hands trembled with fright as she held the letter closer but as she read the next paragraph she relaxed  Page    Gone With The Wind Dear Wife if I have concealed aught from you it is because I did not wish to lay a burden on your shoulders to add to your worries for my physical safety with those of my mental turmoil But I can keep nothing from you for you know me too well Do not be alarmed I have no wound I have not been ill I have enough to eat and occasionally a bed to sleep in A soldier can ask for no more But Melanie heavy thoughts lie on my heart and I will open my heart to you These summer nights I lie awake long after the camp is sleeping and I look up at the stars and over and over I wonder Why are you here Ashley Wilkes What are you fighting for Not for honor and glory certainly War is a dirty business and I do not like dirt I am not a soldier and I have no desire to seek the bubble reputation even in the cannons mouth Yet here I am at the warswhom God never intended to be other than a studious country gentleman For Melanie bugles do not stir my blood nor drums entice my feet and I see too clearly that we have been betrayed betrayed by our arrogant Southern selves believing that one of us could whip a dozen Yankees believing that King Cotton could rule the world Betrayed too by words and catch phrases prejudices and hatreds coming from the mouths of those highly placed those men whom we respected and reveredKing Cotton Slavery States Rights Damn Yankees And so when I lie on my blanket and look up at the stars and say What are you fighting for think of States Rights and cotton and the darkies and the Yankees whom we have been bred to hate and I know that none of these is the reason why I am fighting Instead I see Twelve Oaks and remember how the moonlight slants across the white columns and the unearthly way the magnolias look opening under the moon and how the climbing roses make the side porch shady even at the hottest noon And I see Mother sewing there as she did when I was a little boy And I hear the darkies coming home across the fields at dusk tired and singing and ready for supper and the sound of the windlass as the bucket goes down into the cool well And theres the long view down the road to the river across the cotton fields and the mist rising from the bottom lands in the twilight And that is why Im here who have no love of death or misery or glory and no hatred for anyone Perhaps that is what is called patriotism love of home and country But Melanie it goes deeper than that For Melanie these things I have named are but the symbols of the thing for which I risk my life symbols of the kind of life I love For I am fighting for the old days the old ways I love so much but which I fear are now gone forever no matter how the die may fall For win or lose we lose just the same If we win this war and have the Cotton Kingdom of our dreams we still have lost for we will become a different people and the old quiet ways will go The world will be at our doors clamoring for cotton and we can command our own price Then I fear we will become like the Yankees at whose moneymaking activities acquisitiveness and commercialism we now sneer And if we lose Melanie if we lose I am not afraid of danger or capture or wounds or even death if death must come but I do fear that once this war is over we will never get back to the old times And I belong in those old times I do not belong in this mad present of killing and I fear I will not fit into any future try though I may Nor will you my dear for you and I are of the same blood I do not know what the future will bring but it cannot be as beautiful or as satisfying as the past I lie and look at the boys sleeping near me and I wonder if the twins or Alex or Cade think these same thoughts I wonder if they know they are fighting for a Cause that was lost the minute the first shot was fired for our Cause is really our own way of living and that is gone already But I do not think they think these things and they are lucky I had not thought of this for us when I asked you to marry me I had thought of life going on at Twelve Oaks as it had always done peacefully easily unchanging We are alike Melanie loving the same quiet things and I saw before us a long stretch of uneventful years in which to read hear music and dream But not this Never this That this could happen to us all this wrecking of old ways this bloody slaughter and hate Melanie nothing is worth itStates Rights nor slaves nor cotton Nothing is worth what is happening to us now and what may happen for if the Yankees whip us the future will be one of incredible horror And my dear they may yet whip us I should not write those words I should not even think them But you have asked me what was in my heart and the fear of defeat is there Do you remember at the barbecue the day our engagement was announced that a man named Butler a Charlestonian by his accent nearly caused a fight by his remarks about the ignorance of Southerners Do you recall how the twins wanted to shoot him because he said we had few foundries and factories mills and ships arsenals and machine shops Do you recall how he said the Yankee fleet could bottle us up so tightly we could not ship out our cotton He was right We are fighting the Yankees new rifles with Revolutionary War muskets and soon the blockade will be too tight for even medical supplies to slip in We should have paid heed to cynics like Butler who knew instead of statesmen who feltand talked He said in effect that the South had nothing with which to wage war but cotton and arrogance Our cotton is worthless and what he called arrogance is all that is left But I call that arrogance matchless courage If But Scarlett carefully folded up the letter without finishing it and thrust it back into the envelope too bored to read further Besides the tone of the letter vaguely depressed her with its foolish talk of defeat After all she wasnt reading Melanies mail to learn Ashleys puzzling and uninteresting ideas She had had to listen to enough of them when he sat on the porch at Tara in days gone by All she wanted to know was whether he wrote impassioned letters to his wife So far he had not She had read every letter in the writing box and there was nothing in any one of them that a brother might not have written to a sister They were affectionate humorous discursive but not the letters of a lover Scarlett had received too many ardent love letters herself not to recognize the authentic note of passion when she saw it And that note was missing As always after her secret readings a feeling of smug satisfaction enveloped her for she felt certain that Ashley still loved her And always she wondered sneeringly why Melanie did not realize that Ashley only loved her as a friend Melanie evidently found nothing lacking in her husbands messages but Melanie had had no other mans love letters with which to compare Ashleys He writes such crazy letters Scarlett thought If ever any husband of mine wrote me such twaddletwaddle hed certainly hear from me Why even Charlie wrote better letters than these She flipped back the edges of the letters looking at the dates remembering their contents In them there were no fine descriptive pages of bivouacs and charges such as Darcy Meade wrote his parents or poor Dallas McLure had written his oldmaid sisters Misses Faith and Hope The Meades and McLures proudly read these letters all over the neighborhood and  Page    Gone With The Wind Scarlett had frequently felt a secret shame that Melanie had no such letters from Ashley to read aloud at sewing circles It was as though when writing Melanie Ashley tried to ignore the war altogether and sought to draw about the two of them a magic circle of timelessness shutting out everything that had happened since Fort Sumter was the news of the day It was almost as if he were trying to believe there wasnt any war He wrote of books which he and Melanie had read and songs they had sung of old friends they knew and places he had visited on his Grand Tour Through the letters ran a wistful yearning to be back home at Twelve Oaks and for pages he wrote of the hunting and the long rides through the still forest paths under frosty autumn stars the barbecues the fish fries the quiet of moonlight nights and the serene charm of the old house She thought of his words in the letter she had just read Not this Never this and they seemed to cry of a tormented soul facing something he could not face yet must face It puzzled her for if he was not afraid of wounds and death what was it he feared Unanalytical she struggled with the complex thought The war disturbs him and hehe doesnt like things that disturb him  Me for instance  He loved me but he was afraid to marry me becausefor fear Id upset his way of thinking and living No it wasnt exactly that he was afraid Ashley isnt a coward He couldnt be when hes been mentioned in dispatches and when Colonel Sloan wrote that letter to Melly all about his gallant conduct in leading the charge Once hes made up his mind to do something no one could be braver or more determined but He lives inside his head instead of outside in the world and he hates to come out into the world and Oh I dont know what it is If Id just understood this one thing about him years ago I know hed have married me She stood for a moment holding the letters to her breast thinking longingly of Ashley Her emotions toward him had not changed since the day when she first fell in love with him They were the same emotions that struck her speechless that day when she was fourteen years old and she had stood on the porch of Tara and seen Ashley ride up smiling his hair shining silver in the morning sun Her love was still a young girls adoration for a man she could not understand a man who possessed all the qualities she did not own but which she admired He was still a young girls dream of the Perfect Knight and her dream asked no more than acknowledgment of his love went no further than hopes of a kiss After reading the letters she felt certain he did love her Scarlett even though he had married Melanie and that certainty was almost all that she desired She was still that young and untouched Had Charles with his fumbling awkwardness and his embarrassed intimacies tapped any of the deep vein of passionate feeling within her her dreams of Ashley would not be ending with a kiss But those few moonlight nights alone with Charles had not touched her emotions or ripened her to maturity Charles had awakened no idea of what passion might be or tenderness or true intimacy of body or spirit All that passion meant to her was servitude to inexplicable male madness unshared by females a painful and embarrassing process that led inevitably to the still more painful process of childbirth That marriage should be like this was no surprise to her Ellen had hinted before the wedding that marriage was something women must bear with dignity and fortitude and the whispered comments of other matrons since her widowhood had confirmed this Scarlett was glad to be done with passion and marriage She was done with marriage but not with love for her love for Ashley was something different having nothing to do with passion or marriage something sacred and breathtakingly beautiful an emotion that grew stealthily through the long days of her enforced silence feeding on oftthumbed memories and hopes She sighed as she carefully tied the ribbon about the packet wondering for the thousandth time just what it was in Ashley that eluded her understanding She tried to think the matter to some satisfactory conclusion but as always the conclusion evaded her uncomplex mind She put the letters back in the lap secretary and closed the lid Then she frowned for her mind went back to the last part of the letter she had just read to his mention of Captain Butler How strange that Ashley should be impressed by something that scamp had said a year ago Undeniably Captain Butler was a scamp for all that he danced divinely No one but a scamp would say the things about the Confederacy that he had said at the bazaar She crossed the room to the mirror and parted her smooth hair approvingly Her spirits rose as always at the sight of her white skin and slanting green eyes and she smiled to bring out her dimples Then she dismissed Captain Butler from her mind as she happily viewed her reflection remembering how Ashley had always liked her dimples No pang of conscience at loving another womans husband or reading that womans mail disturbed her pleasure in her youth and charm and her renewed assurance of Ashleys love She unlocked the door and went down the dim winding stair with a light heart Halfway down she began singing When This Cruel War Is Over CHAPTER XII THE WAR went on successfully for the most part but people had stopped saying One more victory and the war is over just as they had stopped saying the Yankees were cowards It was obvious to all now that the Yankees were far from cowardly and that it would take more than one victory to conquer them However there were the Confederate victories in Tennessee scored by General Morgan and General Forrest and the triumph at the Second Battle of Bull Run hung up like visible Yankee scalps to gloat over But there was a heavy price on these scalps The hospitals and homes of Atlanta were overflowing with the sick and wounded and more and more women were appearing in black The monotonous rows of soldiers graves at Oakland Cemetery stretched longer every day Confederate money had dropped alarmingly and the price of food and clothing had risen accordingly The commissary was laying such heavy levies on foodstuffs that the tables of Atlanta were beginning to suffer White flour was scarce and so expensive that corn bread was universal instead of biscuits rolls and waffles The butcher shops carried almost no beef and very little mutton and that mutton cost so much only the rich could afford it However there was still plenty of hog meat as well as chickens and vegetables The Yankee blockade about the Confederate ports had tightened and luxuries such as tea coffee silks whalebone stays colognes fashion magazines and books were scarce and dear Even the cheapest cotton goods had skyrocketed in price and ladies were regretfully making their old dresses do another season Looms that had gathered dust for years had been brought down from  Page    Gone With The Wind attics and there were webs of homespun to be found in nearly every parlor Everyone soldiers civilians women children and negroes began to wear homespun Gray as the color of the Confederate uniform practically disappeared and homespun of a butternut shade took its place Already the hospitals were worrying about the scarcity of quinine calomel opium chloroform and iodine Linen and cotton bandages were too precious now to be thrown away when used and every lady who nursed at the hospitals brought home baskets of bloody strips to be washed and ironed and returned for use on other sufferers But to Scarlett newly emerged from the chrysalis of widowhood all the war meant was a time of gaiety and excitement Even the small privations of clothing and food did not annoy her so happy was she to be in the world again When she thought of the dull times of the past year with the days going by one very much like another life seemed to have quickened to an incredible speed Every day dawned as an exciting adventure a day in which she would meet new men who would ask to call on her tell her how pretty she was and how it was a privilege to fight and perhaps to die for her She could and did love Ashley with the last breath in her body but that did not prevent her from inveigling other men into asking to marry her The everpresent war in the background lent a pleasant informality to social relations an informality which older people viewed with alarm Mothers found strange men calling on their daughters men who came without letters of introduction and whose antecedents were unknown To their horror mothers found their daughters holding hands with these men Mrs Merriwether who had never kissed her husband until after the wedding ceremony could scarcely believe her eyes when she caught Maybelle kissing the little Zouave Ren Picard and her consternation was even greater when Maybelle refused to be ashamed Even the fact that Ren immediately asked for her hand did not improve matters Mrs Merriwether felt that the South was heading for a complete moral collapse and frequently said so Other mothers concurred heartily with her and blamed it on the war But men who expected to die within a week or a month could not wait a year before they begged to call a girl by her first name with Miss of course preceding it Nor would they go through the formal and protracted courtships which good manners had prescribed before the war They were likely to propose in three or four months And girls who knew very well that a lady always refused a gentleman the first three times he proposed rushed headlong to accept the first time This informality made the war a lot of fun for Scarlett Except for the messy business of nursing and the bore of bandage rolling she did not care if the war lasted forever In fact she could endure the hospital with equanimity now because it was a perfect happy hunting ground The helpless wounded succumbed to her charms without a struggle Renew their bandages wash their faces pat up their pillows and fan them and they fell in love Oh it was Heaven after the last dreary year Scarlett was back again where she had been before she married Charles and it was as if she had never married him never felt the shock of his death never borne Wade War and marriage and childbirth had passed over her without touching any deep chord within her and she was unchanged She had a child but he was cared for so well by the others in the red brick house she could almost forget him In her mind and heart she was Scarlett OHara again the belle of the County Her thoughts and activities were the same as they had been in the old days but the field of her activities had widened immensely Careless of the disapproval of Aunt Pittys friends she behaved as she had behaved before her marriage went to parties danced went riding with soldiers flirted did everything she had done as a girl except stop wearing mourning This she knew would be a straw that would break the backs of Pittypat and Melanie She was as charming a widow as she had been a girl pleasant when she had her own way obliging as long as it did not discommode her vain of her looks and her popularity She was happy now where a few weeks before she had been miserable happy with her beaux and their reassurances of her charm as happy as she could be with Ashley married to Melanie and in danger But somehow it was easier to bear the thought of Ashley belonging to some one else when he was far away With the hundreds of miles stretching between Atlanta and Virginia he sometimes seemed as much hers as Melanies So the autumn months of  went swiftly by with nursing dancing driving and bandage rolling taking up all the time she did not spend on brief visits to Tara These visits were disappointing for she had little opportunity for the long quiet talks with her mother to which she looked forward while in Atlanta no time to sit by Ellen while she sewed smelling the faint fragrance of lemon verbena sachet as her skirts rustled feeling her soft hands on her cheek in a gentle caress Ellen was thin and preoccupied now and on her feet from morning until long after the plantation was asleep The demands of the Confederate commissary were growing heavier by the month and hers was the task of making Tara produce Even Gerald was busy for the first time in many years for he could get no overseer to take Jonas Wilkersons place and he was riding his own acres With Ellen too busy for more than a goodnight kiss and Gerald in the fields all day Scarlett found Tara boring Even her sisters were taken up with their own concerns Suellen had now come to an understanding with Frank Kennedy and sang When This Cruel War Is Over with an arch meaning Scarlett found wellnigh unendurable and Carreen was too wrapped up in dreams of Brent Tarleton to be interesting company Though Scarlett always went home to Tara with a happy heart she was never sorry when the inevitable letters came from Pitty and Melanie begging her to return Ellen always sighed at these times saddened by the thought of her oldest daughter and her only grandchild leaving her But I mustnt be selfish and keep you here when you are needed to nurse in Atlanta she said Onlyonly my darling it seems that I never get the time to talk to you and to feel that you are my own little girl again before you are gone from me Im always your little girl Scarlett would say and bury her head upon Ellens breast her guilt rising up to accuse her She did not tell her mother that it was the dancing and the beaux which drew her back to Atlanta and not the service of the Confederacy There were many things she kept from her mother these days But most of all she kept secret the fact that Rhett Butler called fre quently at Aunt Pittypats house During the months that followed the bazaar Rhett called whenever he was in town taking Scarlett riding in his carriage escorting her to danceables and bazaars and waiting outside the hospital to drive her home She lost her fear of his betraying her secret but there always lurked in the back of her mind the disquieting memory that he had seen her at her worst and knew the  Page    Gone With The Wind truth about Ashley It was this knowledge that checked her tongue when he annoyed her And he annoyed her frequently He was in his midthirties older than any beau she had ever had and she was as helpless as a child to control and handle him as she had handled beaux nearer her own age He always looked as if nothing had ever surprised him and much had amused him and when he had gotten her into a speechless temper she felt that she amused him more than anything in the world Frequently she flared into open wrath under his expert baiting for she had Geralds Irish temper along with the deceptive sweetness of face she had inherited from Ellen Heretofore she had never bothered to control her temper except in Ellens presence Now it was painful to have to choke back words for fear of his amused grin If only he would ever lose his temper too then she would not feel at such a disadvantage After tilts with him from which she seldom emerged the victor she vowed he was impossible illbred and no gentleman and she would have nothing more to do with him But sooner or later he returned to Atlanta called presumably on Aunt Pitty and presented Scarlett with overdone gallantry a box of bonbons he had brought her from Nassau Or preempted a seat by her at a musicale or claimed her at a dance and she was usually so amused by his bland impudence that she laughed and overlooked his past misdeeds until the next occurred For all his exasperating qualities she grew to look forward to his calls There was something exciting about him that she could not analyze something different from any man she had ever known There was something breathtaking in the grace of his big body which made his very entrance into a room like an abrupt physical impact something in the impertinence and bland mockery of his dark eyes that challenged her spirit to subdue him Its almost like I was in love with him she thought bewildered But Im not and I just cant understand it But the exciting feeling persisted When he came to call his complete masculinity made Aunt Pittys wellbred and ladylike house seem small pale and a trifle fusty Scarlett was not the only member of the household who reacted strangely and unwillingly to his presence for her kept Aunt Pitty in a flutter and a ferment While Pitty knew Ellen would disapprove of his calls on her daughter and knew also that the edict of Charleston banning him from polite society was not one to be lightly disregarded she could no more resist his elaborate compliments and hand kissing than a fly can resist a honey pot Moreover he usually brought her some little gift from Nassau which he assured her he had purchased especially for her and blockaded in at risk of his lifepapers of pins and needles buttons spools of silk thread and hairpins It was almost impossible to obtain these small luxuries nowladies were wearing handwhittled wooden hairpins and covering acrons with cloth for buttonsand Pitty lacked the moral stamina to refuse them Besides she had a childish love of surprise packages and could not resist opening his gifts And having once opened them she did not feel that she could refuse them Then having accepted his gifts she could not summon courage enough to tell him his reputation made it improper for him to call on three lone women who had no male protector Aunt Pitty always felt that she needed a male protector when Rhett Butler was in the house I dont know what it is about him she would sigh helplessly Butwell I think hed be a nice attractive man if I could just feel thatwell that deep down in his heart he respected women Since the return of her wedding ring Melanie had felt that Rhett was a gentleman of rare refinement and delicacy and she was shocked at this remark He was unfailingly courteous to her but she was a little timid with him largely because she was shy with any man she had not known from childhood Secretly she was very sorry for him a feeling which would have amused him had he been aware of it She was certain that some romantic sorrow had blighted his life and made him hard and bitter and she felt that what he needed was the love of a good woman In all her sheltered life she had never seen evil and could scarcely credit its existence and when gossip whispered things about Rhett and the girl in Charleston she was shocked and unbelieving And instead of turning her against him it only made her more timidly gracious toward him because of her indignation at what she fancied was a gross injustice done him Scarlett silently agreed with Aunt Pitty She too felt that he had no respect for any woman unless perhaps for Melanie She still felt unclothed every time his eyes ran up and down her figure It was not that he ever said anything Then she could have scorched him with hot words It was the bold way his eyes looked out of his swarthy face with a displeasing air of insolence as if all women were his property to be enjoyed in his own good time Only with Melanie was this look absent There was never that cool look of appraisal never mockery in his eyes when he looked at Melanie and there was an especial note in his voice when he spoke to her courteous respectful anxious to be of service I dont see why youre so much nicer to her than to me said Scarlett petulantly one afternoon when Melanie and Pitty had retired to take their naps and she was alone with him For an hour she had watched Rhett hold the yarn Melanie was winding for knitting had noted the blank inscrutable expression when Melanie talked at length and with pride of Ashley and his promotion Scarlett knew Rhett had no exalted opinion of Ashley and cared nothing at all about the fact that he had been made a major Yet he made polite replies and murmured the correct things about Ashleys gallantry And if I so much as mention Ashleys name she had thought irritably he cocks his eyebrow up and smiles that nasty knowing smile Im much prettier than she is she continued and I dont see why youre nicer to her Dare I hope that you are jealous Oh dont presume Another hope crushed If I am nicer to Mrs Wilkes it is because she deserves it She is one of the very few kind sincere and unselfish persons I have ever known But perhaps you have failed to note these qualities And moreover for all her youth she is one of the few great ladies I have ever been privileged to know Do you mean to say you dont think Im a great lady too I think we agreed on the occasion of our first meeting that you were no lady at all Oh if you are going to be hateful and rude enough to bring that up again How can you hold that bit of childish temper against me That was so long ago and Ive grown up since then and Id forget all about it if you werent always harping and hinting about  Page    Gone With The Wind it I dont think it was childish temper and I dont believe youve changed You are just as capable now as then of throwing vases if you dont get your own way But you usually get your way now And so theres no necessity for broken bricabrac Oh you areI wish I was a man Id call you out and And get killed for your pains I can drill a dime at fifty yards Better stick to your own weaponsdimples vases and the like You are just a rascal Do you expect me to fly into a rage at that I am sorry to disappoint you You cant make me mad by calling me names that are true Certainly Im a rascal and why not Its a free country and a man may be a rascal if he chooses Its only hypocrites like you my dear lady just as black at heart but trying to hide it who become enraged when called by their right names She was helpless before his calm smile and his drawling remarks for she had never before met anyone who was so completely impregnable Her weapons of scorn coldness and abuse blunted in her hands for nothing she could say would shame him It had been her experience that the liar was the hottest to defend his veracity the coward his courage the illbred his gentlemanliness and the cad his honor But not Rhett He admitted everything and laughed and dared her to say more He came and went during these months arriving unheralded and leaving without saying goodby Scarlett never discovered just what business brought him to Atlanta for few other blockaders found it necessary to come so far away from the coast They landed their cargoes at Wilmington or Charleston where they were met by swarms of merchants and speculators from all over the South who assembled to buy blockaded goods at auction It would have pleased her to think that he made these trips to see her but even her abnormal vanity refused to believe this If he had ever once made love to her seemed jealous of the other men who crowded about her even tried to hold her hand or begged for a picture or a handkerchief to cherish she would have thought triumphantly he had been caught by her charms But he remained annoyingly unloverlike and worst of all seemed to see through all her maneuverings to bring him to his knees Whenever he came to town there was a feminine fluttering Not only did the romantic aura of the dashing blockader hang about him but there was also the titillating element of the wicked and the forbidden He had such a bad reputation And every time the matrons of Atlanta gathered together to gossip his reputation grew worse which only made him all the more glamorous to the young girls As most of them were quite innocent they had heard little more than that he was quite loose with womenand exactly how a man went about the business of being loose they did not know They also heard whispers that no girt was safe with him With such a reputation it was strange that he had never so much as kissed the hand of an unmarried girl since he first appeared in Atlanta But that only served to make him more mysterious and more exciting Outside of the army heroes he was the most talkedabout man in Atlanta Everyone knew in detail how he had been expelled from West Point for drunkenness and something about women That terrific scandal concerning the Charleston girl he had compromised and the brother he had killed was public property Correspondence with Charleston friends elicited the further information that his father a charming old gentleman with an iron will and a ramrod for a backbone had cast him out without a penny when he was twenty and even stricken his name from the family Bible After that he had wandered to California in the gold rush of  and thence to South America and Cuba and the reports of his activities in these parts were none too savory Scrapes about women several shootings gun running to the revolutionists in Central America and worst of all professional gambling were included in his career as Atlanta heard it There was hardly a family in Georgia who could not own to their sorrow at least one male member or relative who gambled losing money houses land and slaves But that was different A man could gamble himself to poverty and still be a gentleman but a professional gambler could never be anything but an outcast Had it not been for the upset conditions due to the war and his own services to the Confederate government Rhett Butler would never have been received in Atlanta But now even the most strait laced felt that patriotism called upon them to be more broad minded The more sentimental were inclined to view that the black sheep of the Butler family had repented of his evil ways and was making an attempt to atone for his sins So the ladies felt in duty bound to stretch a point especially in the case of so intrepid a blockader Everyone knew now that the fate of the Confederacy rested as much upon the skill of the blockade boats in eluding the Yankee fleet as it did upon the soldiers at the front Rumor had it that Captain Butler was one of the best pilots in the South and that he was reckless and utterly without nerves Reared in Charleston he knew every inlet creek shoal and rock of the Carolina coast near that port and he was equally at home in the waters around Wilmington He had never lost a boat or even been forced to dump a cargo At the onset of the war he had emerged from obscurity with enough money to buy a small swift boat and now when blockaded goods realized two thousand per cent on each cargo he owned four boats He had good pilots and paid them well and they slid out of Charleston and Wilmington on dark nights bearing cotton for Nassau England and Canada The cotton mills of England were standing idle and the workers were starving and any blockader who could outwit the Yankee fleet could command his own price in Liverpool Rhetts boats were singularly lucky both in taking out cotton for the Confederacy and bringing in the war materials for which the South was desperate Yes the ladies felt they could forgive and forget a great many things for such a brave man He was a dashing figure and one that people turned to look at He spent money freely rode a wild black stallion and wore clothes which were always the height of style and tailoring The latter in itself was enough to attract attention to him for the uniforms of the soldiers were dingy and worn now and the civilians even when turned out in their best showed skillful patching and darning Scarlett thought she had never seen such elegant pants as he wore fawn colored shepherds plaid and checked As for his waistcoats they were indescribably handsome especially the white wateredsilk one with tiny pink rosebuds embroidered on it And he wore these garments with a still more elegant air as though unaware of their glory There were few ladies who could resist his charms when he chose to exert them and finally even Mrs Merriwether unbent and invited him to Sunday dinner Maybelle Merriwether was to marry her little Zouave when he got his next furlough and she cried every time she thought of it for she had set her heart on marrying in a white satin dress and there was no white satin in the Confederacy Nor could she borrow a dress for the satin wedding dresses of years past had all gone into the making of battle flags Useless for the patriotic Mrs  Page    Gone With The Wind Merriwether to upbraid her daughter and point out that homespun was the proper bridal attire for a Confederate bride Maybelle wanted satin She was willing even proud to go without hairpins and buttons and nice shoes and candy and tea for the sake of the Cause but she wanted a satin wedding dress Rhett hearing of this from Melanie brought in from England yards and yards of gleaming white satin and a lace veil and presented them to her as a wedding gift He did it in such a way that it was unthinkable to even mention paying him for them and Maybelle was so delighted she almost kissed him Mrs Merriwether knew that so expensive a giftand a gift of clothing at thatwas highly improper but she could think of no way of refusing when Rhett told her in the most florid language that nothing was too good to deck the bride of one of our brave heroes So Mrs Merriwether invited him to dinner feeling that this concession more than paid for the gift He not only brought Maybelle the satin but he was able to give excellent hints on the making of the wedding dress Hoops in Paris were wider this season and skirts were shorter They were no longer ruffled but were gathered up in scalloped festoons showing braided petticoats beneath He said too that he had seen no pantalets on the streets so he imagined they were out Afterwards Mrs Merriwether told Mrs Elsing she feared that if she had given him any encouragement at all he would have told her exactly what kind of drawers were being worn by Parisiennes Had he been less obviously masculine his ability to recall details of dresses bonnets and coiffures would have been put down as the rankest effeminacy The ladies always felt a little odd when they besieged him with questions about styles but they did it nevertheless They were as isolated from the world of fashion as shipwrecked mariners for few books of fashion came through the blockade For all they knew the ladies of France might be shaving their heads and wearing coonskin caps so Rhetts memory for furbelows was an excellent substitute for G odeys Ladys Book  He could and did notice details so dear to feminine hearts and after each trip abroad he could be found in the center of a group of ladies telling that bonnets were smaller this year and perched higher covering most of the top of the head that plumes and not flowers were being used to trim them that the Empress of France had abandoned the chignon for evening wear and had her hair piled almost on the top of her head showing all of her ears and that evening frocks were shockingly low again For some months he was the most popular and romantic figure the town knew despite his previous reputation despite the faint rumors that he was engaged not only in blockading but in speculating on foodstuffs too People who did not like him said that after every trip he made to Atlanta prices jumped five dollars But even with this undercover gossip seeping about he could have retained his popularity had he considered it worth retaining Instead it seemed as though after trying the company of the staid and patriotic citizens and winning their respect and grudging liking something perverse in him made him go out of his way to affront them and show them that his conduct had been only a masquerade and one which no longer amused him It was as though he bore an impersonal contempt for everyone and everything in the South the Confederacy in particular and toot no pains to conceal it It was his remarks about the Confederacy that made Atlanta look at him first in bewilderment then coolly and then with hot rage Even before  passed into  men were bowing to him with studied frigidity and women beginning to draw their daughters to their sides when he appeared at a gathering He seemed to take pleasure not only in affronting the sincere and redhot loyalties of Atlanta but in presenting himself in the worst possible light When wellmeaning people complimented him on his bravery in running the blockade he blandly replied that he was always frightened when in danger as frightened as were the brave boys at the front Everyone knew there had never been a cowardly Confederate soldier and they found this statement peculiarly irritating He always referred to the soldiers as our brave boys and our heroes in gray and did it in such a way as to convey the utmost in insult When daring young ladies hoping for a flirtation thanked him for being one of the heroes who fought for them he bowed and declared that such was not the case for he would do the same thing for Yankee women if the same amount of money were involved Since Scarletts first meeting with him in Atlanta on the night of the bazaar he had talked with her in this manner but now mere was a thinly veiled note of mockery in his conversations with everyone When praised for his services to the Confederacy he unfailingly replied that blockading was a business with him If he could make as much money out of government contracts he would say picking out with his eyes those who had government contracts then he would certainly abandon the hazards of blockading and take to selling shoddy cloth sanded sugar spoiled flour and rotten leather to the Confederacy Most of his remarks were unanswerable which made them all the worse There had already been minor scandals about those holding government contracts Letters from men at the front complained constantly of shoes that wore out in a week gunpowder that would not ignite harness that snapped at any strain meat that was rotten and flour that was full of weevils Atlanta people tried to think that the men who sold such stuff to the government must be contract holders from Alabama or Virginia or Ten nessee and not Georgians For did not the Georgia contract holders include men from the very best families Were they not the first to contribute to the hospital funds and to the aid of soldiers orphans Were they not the first to cheer at Dixie and the most rampant seekers in oratory at least for Yankee blood The full tide of fury against those profiteering on government contracts had not yet risen and Rhetts words were taken merely as evidence of his own bad breeding He not only affronted the town with insinuations of venality on the part of men in high places and slurs on the courage of the men in the field but he took pleasure in tricking the dignified citizenry into embarrassing situations He could no more resist pricking the conceits the hypocrisies and the flamboyant patriotism of those about him than a small boy can resist putting a pin into a balloon He neatly deflated the pompous and exposed the ignorant and the bigoted and he did it in such subtle ways drawing his victims out by his seemingly courteous interest that they never were quite certain what had happened until they stood exposed as windy high flown and slightly ridiculous During the months when the town accepted him Scarlett had been under no illusions about him She knew that his elaborate gallantries and his florid speeches were all done with his tongue in his cheek She knew that he was acting the part of the dashing and patriotic blockade runner simply because it amused him Sometimes he seemed to her like the County boys with whom she had grown up the wild Tarleton twins with their obsession for practical jokes the devilinspired Fontaines teasing mischievous the Calverts who would sit up all night planning hoaxes But there was a difference for beneath Rhetts seeming lightness there  Page    Gone With The Wind was something malicious almost sinister in its suave brutality Though she was thoroughly aware of his insincerity she much preferred him in the rle of the romantic blockader For one thing it made her own situation in associating with him so much easier than it had been at first So she was intensely annoyed when he dropped his masquerade and set out apparently upon a deliberate campaign to alienate Atlantas good will It annoyed her because it seemed foolish and also because some of the harsh criticism directed at him fell on her It was at Mrs Elsings silver musicale for the benefit of the convalescents that Rhett signed his final warrant of ostracism That afternoon the Elsing home was crowded with soldiers on leave and men from the hospitals members of the Home Guard and the militia unit and matrons widows and young girls Every chair in the house was occupied and even the long winding stair was packed with guests The large cutglass bowl held at the door by the Elsings butler had been emptied twice of its burden of silver coins That in itself was enough to make the affair a success for now a dollar in silver was worth sixty dollars in Confederate paper money Every girl with any pretense to accomplishments had sung or played the piano and the tableaux vivants had been greeted with flattering applause Scarlett was much pleased with herself for not only had she and Melanie rendered a touching duet When the Dew Is on the Blossom followed as an encore by the more sprightly Oh Lawd Ladies Dont Mind Stephen but she had also been chosen to represent the Spirit of the Confederacy in the last tableau She had looked most fetching wearing a modestly draped Greek robe of white cheesecloth girdled with red and blue and holding the Stars and Bars in one hand while with the other she stretched out to the kneeling Captain Carey Ashburn of Alabama the goldhilted saber which had belonged to Charles and his father When her tableau was over she could not help seeking Rhetts eyes to see if he had appreciated the pretty picture she made With a feeling of exasperation she saw that he was in an argument and probably had not even noticed her Scarlett could see by the faces of the group surrounding him that they were infuriated by what he was saying She made her way toward them and in one of those odd silences which sometimes fall on a gathering she heard Willie Guinan of the militia outfit say plainly Do I understand sir that you mean the Cause for which our heroes have died is not sacred If you were run over by a railroad train your death wouldnt sanctify the railroad company would it asked Rhett and his voice sounded as if he were humbly seeking information Sir said Willie his voice shaking if we were not under this roof I tremble to think what would happen said Rhett For of course your bravery is too well known Willie went scarlet and all conversation ceased Everyone was embarrassed Willie was strong and healthy and of military age and yet he wasnt at the front Of course he was the only boy his mother had and after all somebody had to be in the militia to protect the state But there were a few irreverent snickers from convalescent officers when Rhett spoke of bravery Oh why doesnt he keep his mouth shut thought Scarlett indignantly Hes simply spoiling the whole party Dr Meades brows were thunderous Nothing may be sacred to you young man he said in the voice he always used when making speeches But there are many things sacred to the patriotic men and ladies of the South And the freedom of our land from the usurper is one and States Rights is another and Rhett looked lazy and his voice had a silky almost bored note All wars are sacred he said To those who have to fight them If the people who started wars didnt make them sacred who would be foolish enough to fight But no matter what rallying cries the orators give to the idiots who fight no matter what noble purposes they assign to wars there is never but one reason for a war And that is money All wars are in reality money squabbles But so few people ever realize it Their ears are too full of bugles and drums and the fine words from stayathome orators Sometimes the rallying cry is Save the Tomb of Christ from the Heathen Sometimes its Down with Popery and sometimes Liberty and sometimes Cotton Slavery and States Rights  What on earth has the Pope to do with it thought Scarlett Or Christs tomb either But as she hurried toward the incensed group she saw Rhett bow jauntily and start toward the doorway through the crowd She started after him but Mrs Elsing caught her skirt and held her Let him go she said in a clear voice that carried throughout the tensely quiet room Let him go He is a traitor a speculator He is a viper that we have nursed to our bosoms Rhett standing in the hall his hat in his hand heard as he was intended to hear and turning surveyed the room for a moment He looked pointedly at Mrs Elsings flat bosom grinned suddenly and bowing made his exit Mrs Merriwether rode home in Aunt Pittys carriage and scarcely had the four ladies seated themselves when she exploded There now Pittypat Hamilton I hope you are satisfied With what cried Pitty apprehensively With the conduct of that wretched Butler man youve been harboring Pittypat fluttered too upset by the accusation to recall that Mrs Merriwether had also been Rhett Butlers hostess on several occasions Scarlett and Melanie thought of this but bred to politeness to their elders refrained from remarking on the matter Instead they studiously looked down at their mittened hands He insulted us all and the Confederacy too said Mrs Merriwether and her stout bust heaved violently beneath its glittering passementerie trimmings Saying that we were fighting for money Saying that our leaders had lied to us He should be put in jail Yes he should I shall speak to Dr Meade about it If Mr Merriwether were only alive hed tend to him Now Pitty Hamilton you listen to me You mustnt ever let that scamp come into your house again Oh mumbled Pitty helplessly looking as if she wished she were dead She looked appealingly at the two girls who kept their eyes cast down and then hopefully toward Uncle Peters erect back She knew he was listening attentively to every word and she hoped he would turn and take a hand in the conversation as he frequently did She hoped he would say Now Miss Dolly you let Miss Pitty be but Peter made no move He disapproved heartily of Rhett Butler and poor Pitty knew it She sighed and  Page    Gone With The Wind said Well Dolly if you think I do think returned Mrs Merriwether firmly I cant imagine what possessed you to receive him in the first place After this afternoon there wont be a decent home in town that hell be welcome in Do get up some gumption and forbid him your house She turned a sharp eye on the girls I hope you two are marking my words she continued for its partly your fault being so pleasant to him Just tell him politely but firmly that his presence and his disloyal talk are distinctly unwelcome at your house By this time Scarlett was boiling ready to rear like a horse at the touch of a strange rough hand on its bridle But she was afraid to speak She could not risk Mrs Merriwether writing another letter to her mother You old buffalo she thought her face crimson with suppressed fury How heavenly it would be to tell you just what I think of you and your bossy ways I never thought to live long enough to hear such disloyal words spoken of our Cause went on Mrs Merriwether by this time in a ferment of righteous anger Any man who does not think our Cause is just and holy should be hanged I dont want to hear of you two girls ever even speaking to him again For Heavens sake Melly what ails you Melanie was white and her eyes were enormous I will speak to him again she said in a low voice I will not be rude to him I will not forbid him the house Mrs Merriwethers breath went out of her lungs as explosively as though she had been punched Aunt Pittys fat mouth popped open and Uncle Peter turned to stare Now why didnt I have the gumption to say that thought Scarlett jealousy mixing with admiration How did that little rabbit ever get up spunk enough to stand up to old lady Merriwether Melanies hands were shaking but she went on hurriedly as though fearing her courage would fail her if she delayed I wont be rude to him because of what he said because It was rude of him to say it out loudmost ill advisedbut itsits what Ashley thinks And I cant forbid the house to a man who thinks what my husband thinks It would be unjust Mrs Merriwethers breath had come back and she charged Melly Hamilton I never heard such a lie in all my life There was never a Wilkes who was a coward I never said Ashley was a coward said Melanie her eyes beginning to flash I said he thinks what Captain Butler thinks only he expresses it in different words And he doesnt go around saying it at musicales I hope But he has written it to me Scarletts guilty conscience stirred as she tried to recall what Ashley might have written that would lead Melanie to make such a statement but most of the letters she had read had gone out of her head as soon as she finished reading them She believed Melanie had simply taken leave of her senses Ashley wrote me that we should not be fighting the Yankees And that we have been betrayed into it by statesmen and orators mouthing catchwords and prejudices said Melly rapidly He said nothing in the world was worth what this war was going to do to us He said here wasnt anything at all to gloryit was just misery and dirt Oh That letter thought Scarlett Was that what he meant I dont believe it said Mrs Merriwether firmly You misunderstood his meaning I never misunderstand Ashley Melanie replied quietly though her lips were trembling I understand him perfectly He meant exactly what Captain Butler meant only he didnt say it in a rude way You should be ashamed of yourself comparing a fine man like Ashley Wilkes to a scoundrel like Captain Butler I suppose you too think the Cause is nothing II dont know what I think Melanie began uncertainly her fire deserting her and panic at her outspokenness taking hold of her IId die for the Cause like Ashley would ButI meanI mean Ill let the men folks do the thinking because they are so much smarter I never heard the like snorted Mrs Merriwether Stop Uncle Peter youre driving past my house Uncle Peter preoccupied with the conversation behind him had driven past the Merriwether carriage block and he backed up the horse Mrs Merriwether alighted her bonnet ribbons shaking like sails in a storm Youll be sorry she said Uncle Peter whipped up the horse You young misses ought ter tek shame gittin Miss Pitty in a state he scolded Im not in a state replied Pitty surprisingly for less strain than this had frequently brought on fainting fits Melly honey I knew you were doing it just to take up for me and really I was glad to see somebody take Dolly down a peg Shes so bossy How did you have the courage But do you think you should have said that about Ashley But its true answered Melanie and she began to cry softly And Im not ashamed that he thinks that way He thinks the war is all wrong but hes willing to fight and die anyway and that takes lots more courage than fighting for something you think is right Lawd Miss Melly doan cry hyah on Peachtree Street groaned Uncle Peter hastening his horses pace Folksll talk sumpin scanlous Wait till us gits home Scarlett said nothing She did not even squeeze the hand that Melanie had inserted into her palm for comfort She had read Ashleys letters for only one purposeto assure herself that he still loved her Now Melanie had given a new meaning to passages in the letters which Scarletts eyes had barely seen It shocked her to realize that anyone as absolutely perfect as Ashley could have any thought in common with such a reprobate as Rhett Butler She thought They both see the truth of this war but Ashley is willing to die about it and Rhett isnt I think that shows Rhetts good sense She paused a moment horror struck that she could have such a thought about Ashley They both see the same unpleasant truth but Rhett likes to look it in the face and enrage people by talking about itand Ashley can hardly bear to face it It was very bewildering CHAPTER XIII  Page    Gone With The Wind UNDER MRS MERRIWETHERS GOADING Dr Meade took action in the form of a letter to the newspaper wherein be did not mention Rhett by name though his meaning was obvious The editor sensing the social drama of the letter put it on the second page of the paper in itself a startling innovation as the first two pages of the paper were always devoted to advertisements of slaves mules plows coffins houses for sale or rent cures for private diseases abortifacients and restoratives for lost manhood The doctors letter was the first of a chorus of indignation that was beginning to be heard all over the South against speculators profiteers and holders of government contracts Conditions in Wilmington the chief blockade port now that Charlestons port was practically sealed by the Yankee gunboats had reached the proportions of an open scandal Speculators swarmed Wilmington and having the ready cash bought up boatloads of goods and held them for a rise in prices The rise always came for with the increasing scarcity of necessities prices leaped higher by the month The civilian population had either to do without or buy at the speculators prices and the poor and those in moderate circumstances were suffering increasing hardships With the rise in prices Confederate money sank and with its rapid fall there rose a wild passion for luxuries Blockaders were commissioned to bring in necessities but now it was the higherpriced luxuries that filled their boats to the exclusion of the things the Confederacy vitally needed People frenziedly bought these luxuries with the money they had today fearing that tomorrows prices would be higher and the money worthless To make matters worse there was only one railroad line from Wilmington to Richmond and while thousands of barrels of flour and boxes of bacon spoiled and rotted in wayside stations for want of transportation speculators with wines taffetas and coffee to sell seemed always able to get their goods to Richmond two days after they were landed at Wilmington The rumor which had been creeping about underground was now being openly discussed that Rhett Butler not only ran his own four boats and sold the cargoes at unheardof prices but bought up the cargoes of other boats and held them for rises in prices It was said that he was at the head of a combine worth more than a million dollars with Wilmington as its headquarters for the purpose of buying blockade goods on the docks They had dozens of warehouses in that city and in Richmond so the story ran and the warehouses were crammed with food and clothing that were being held for higher prices Already soldiers and civilians alike were feeling the pinch and the muttering against him and his fellow speculators was bitter There are many brave and patriotic men in the blockade arm of the Confederacys naval service ran the last of the doctors letter unselfish men who are risking their lives and all their wealth that the Confederacy may survive They are enshrined in the hearts of all loyal Southerners and no one begrudges them the scant monetary returns they make for their risks They are unselfish gentlemen and we honor them Of these men I do not speak But there are other scoundrels who masquerade under the cloak of the blockader for their own selfish gains and I call down the just wrath and vengeance of an embattled people fighting in the justest of Causes on these human vultures who bring in satins and laces when our men are dying for want of quinine who load their boats with tea and wines when our heroes are writhing for lack of morphia I execrate these vampires who are sucking the lifeblood of the men who follow Robert Leethese men who are making the very name of blockader a stench in the nostrils of all patriotic men How can we endure these scavengers in our midst with their varnished boots when our boys are tramping barefoot into battle How can we tolerate them with their champagnes and their pates of Strasbourg when our soldiers are shivering about their camp fires and gnawing moldy bacon I call upon every loyal Confederate to cast them out Atlanta read knew the oracle had spoken and as loyal Confederates they hastened to cast Rhett out Of all the homes which had received him in the fall of  Miss Pittypats was almost the only one into which he could enter in  And except for Melanie he probably would not have been received there Aunt Pitty was in a state whenever he was in town She knew very well what her friends were saying when she permitted him to call but she still lacked the courage to tell him he was unwelcome Each time he arrived in Atlanta she set her fat mouth and told the girls that she would meet him at the door and forbid him to enter And each time he came a little package in his hand and a compliment for her charm and beauty on his lips she wilted I just dont know what to do she would moan He just looks at me and IIm scared to death of what he would do if I told him Hes got such a bad reputation Do you suppose he would strike meoror Oh dear if Charlie were only alive Scarlett you must tell him not to call againtell him in a nice way Oh me I do believe you encourage him and the whole town is talking and if your mother ever finds out what will she say to me Melly you must not be so nice to him Be cool and distant and he will understand Oh Melly do you think Id better write Henry a note and ask him to speak to Captain Butler No I dont said Melanie And I wont be rude to him either I think people are acting like chickens with their heads off about Captain Butler Im sure he cant be all the bad things Dr Meade and Mrs Merriwether say he is He wouldnt hold food from starving people Why he even gave me a hundred dollars for the orphans Im sure hes just as loyal and patriotic as any of us and hes just too proud to defend himself You know how obstinate men are when they get their backs up Aunt Pitty knew nothing about men either with their backs up or otherwise and she could only wave her fat little hands helplessly As for Scarlett she had long ago become resigned to Melanies habit of seeing good in everyone Melanie was a fool but there was nothing anybody could do about it Scarlett knew that Rhett was not being patriotic and though she would have died rather than confess it she did not care The little presents he brought her from Nassau little oddments that a lady could accept with propriety were what mattered most to her With prices as high as they were where on earth could she get needles and bonbons and hairpins if she forbade the house to him No it was easier to shift the responsibility to Aunt Pitty who after all was the head of the house the chaperon and the arbiter of morals Scarlett knew the town gossiped about Rhetts calls and about her too but she also knew that in the eyes of Atlanta Melanie Wilkes could do no wrong and if Melanie defended Rhett his calls were still tinged with respectability However life would be pleasanter if Rhett would recant his heresies She wouldnt have to suffer the embarrassment of seeing him cut openly when she walked down Peachtree Street with him Even if you think such things why do you say them she scolded If youd just think what you please but keep your mouth shut everything would be so much nicer  Page    Gone With The Wind Thats your system isnt it my greeneyed hypocrite Scarlett Scarlett I hoped for more courageous conduct from you I thought the Irish said what they thought and the Divvil take the hindermost Tell me truthfully dont you sometimes almost burst from keeping your mouth shut Wellyes Scarlett confessed reluctantly I do get awfully bored when they talk about the Cause morning noon and night But goodness Rhett Butler if I admitted it nobody would speak to me and none of the boys would dance with me Ah yes and one must be danced with at all costs Well I admire your selfcontrol but I do not find myself equal to it Nor can I masquerade in a cloak of romance and patriotism no matter how convenient it might be There are enough stupid patriots who are risking every cent they have in the blockade and who are going to come out of this war paupers They dont need me among their number either to brighten the record of patriotism or to increase the roll of paupers Let them have the haloes They deserve themfor once I am being sincereand besides haloes will be about all they will have in a year or so I think you are very nasty to even hint such things when you know very well that England and France are coming in on our side in no time and Why Scarlett You must have been reading a newspaper Im surprised at you Dont do it again It addles womens brains For your information I was in England not a month ago and Ill tell you this England will never help the Confederacy England never bets on the underdog Thats why shes England Besides the fat Dutch woman who is sitting on the throne is a Godfearing soul and she doesnt approve of slavery Let the English mill workers starve because they cant get our cotton but never never strike a blow for slavery And as for France that weak imitation of Napoleon is far too busy establishing the French in Mexico to be bothered with us In fact he welcomes this war because it keeps us too busy to run his troops out of Mexico  No Scarlett the idea of assistance from abroad is just a newspaper invention to keep up the morale of the South The Confederacy is doomed Its living on its hump now like the camel and even the largest of humps arent inexhaustible I give myself about six months more of blockading and then Im through After that it will be too risky And Ill sell my boats to some foolish Englishman who thinks he can slip them through But one way or the other its not bothering me Ive made money enough and its in English banks and in gold None of this worthless paper for me As always when he spoke he sounded so plausible Other people might call his utterances treachery but to Scarlett they always rang with common sense and truth And she knew that this was utterly wrong knew she should be shocked and infuriated Actually she was neither but she could pretend to be It made her feel more respectable and ladylike I think what Dr Meade wrote about was right Captain Butler The only way to redeem yourself is to enlist after you sell your boats Youre a West Pointer and You talk like a Baptist preacher making a recruiting speech Suppose I dont want to redeem myself Why should I fight to uphold the system that cast me out I shall take pleasure in seeing it smashed I never heard of any system she said crossly No And yet you are a part of it like I was and Ill wager you dont like it any more than I did Well why am I the black sheep of the Butler family For this reason and no otherI didnt conform to Charleston and I couldnt And Charleston is the South only intensified I wonder if you realize yet what a bore it is So many things that one must do because theyve always been done So many things quite harmless that one must not do for the same reason So many things that annoyed me by their senselessness Not marrying the young lady of whom you have probably heard was merely the last straw Why should I marry a boring fool simply because an accident prevented me from getting her home before dark And why permit her wildeyed brother to shoot and kill me when I could shoot straighter If I had been a gentleman of course I would have let him kill me and that would have wiped the blot from the Butler escutcheon ButI like to live And so Ive lived and Ive had a good time  When I think of my brother living among the sacred cows of Charleston and most reverent toward them and remember his stodgy wife and his Saint Cecilia Balls and his everlasting rice fieldsthen I know the compensation for breaking with the system Scarlett our Southern way of living is as antiquated as the feudal system of the Middle Ages The wonder is that its lasted as long as it has It had to go and its going now And yet you expect me to listen to orators like Dr Meade who tell me our Cause is just and holy And get so excited by the roll of drums that Ill grab a musket and rush off to Virginia to shed my blood for Marse Robert What kind of a fool do you think I am Kissing the rod that chastised me is not in my line The South and I are even now The South threw me out to starve once I havent starved and I am making enough money out of the Souths death throes to compensate me for my lost birthright I think you are vile and mercenary said Scarlett but her remark was automatic Most of what he was saying went over her head as did any conversation that was not personal But part of it made sense There were such a lot of foolish things about life among nice people Having to pretend that her heart was in the grave when it wasnt And how shocked everybody had been when she danced at the bazaar And the infuriating way people lifted their eyebrows every time she did or said anything the least bit different from what every other young woman did and said But still she was jarred at hearing him attack the very traditions that irked her most She had lived too long among people who dissembled politely not to feel disturbed at hearing her own thoughts put into words Mercenary No Im only farsighted Though perhaps that is merely a synonym for mercenary At least people who were not as farsighted as I will call it that Any loyal Confederate who had a thousand dollars in cash in  could have done what I did but how few were mercenary enough to take advantage of their opportunities As for instance right after Fort Sumter fell and before the blockade was established I bought up several thousand bales of cotton at dirtcheap prices and ran them to England They are still there in warehouses in Liverpool Ive never sold them Im holding them until the English mills have to have cotton and will give me any price I ask I wouldnt be surprised if I got a dollar a pound Youll get a dollar a pound when elephants roost in trees Ill believe Ill get it Cotton is at seventytwo cents a pound already Im going to be a rich man when this war is over Scarlett because I was farsightedpardon me mercenary I told you once before that there were two times for making big money one in the upbuilding of a country and the other in its destruction Slow money on the upbuilding fast money in the crackup Remember my words Perhaps they may be of use to you some day  Page    Gone With The Wind I do appreciate good advice so much said Scarlett with all the sarcasm she could muster But I dont need your advice Do you think Pa is a pauper Hes got all the money Ill ever need and then I have Charles property besides I imagine the French aristocrats thought practically the same thing until the very moment when they climbed into the tumbrils Frequently Rhett pointed out to Scarlett the inconsistency of her wearing black mourning clothes when she was participating in all social activities He liked bright colors and Scarletts funeral dresses and the crpe veil that hung from her bonnet to her heels both amused him and offended him But she clung to her dull black dresses and her veil knowing that if she changed them for colors without waiting several more years the town would buzz even more than it was already buzzing And besides how would she ever explain to her mother Rhett said frankly that the crpe veil made her look like a crow and the black dresses added ten years to her age This ungallant statement sent her flying to the mirror to see if she really did look twentyeight instead of eighteen I should think youd have more pride than to try to look like Mrs Merriwether he taunted And better taste than to wear that veil to advertise a grief Im sure you never felt Ill lay a wager with you Ill have that bonnet and veil off your head and a Paris creation on it within two months Indeed no and dont lets discuss it any further said Scarlett annoyed by his reference to Charles Rhett who was preparing to leave for Wilmington for another trip abroad departed with a grin on his face One bright summer morning some weeks later he reappeared with a brightly trimmed hatbox in his hand and after finding that Scarlett was alone in the house he opened it Wrapped in layers of tissue was a bonnet a creation that made her cry Oh the darling thing as she reached for it Starved for the sight much less the touch of new clothes it seemed the loveliest bonnet she had ever seen It was of darkgreen taffeta lined with water silk of a palejade color The ribbons that tied under the chin were as wide as her hand and they too were pale green And curled about the brim of this confection was the perkiest of green ostrich plumes Put it on said Rhett smiling She flew across the room to the mirror and plopped it on her head pushing back her hair to show her earrings and tying the ribbon under her chin How do I look she cried pirouetting for his benefit and tossing her head so that the plume danced But she knew she looked pretty even before she saw confirmation in his eyes She looked attractively saucy and the green of the lining made her eyes dark emerald and sparkling Oh Rhett whose bonnet is it Ill buy it Ill give you every cent Ive got for it Its your bonnet he said Who else could wear that shade of green Dont you think I carried the color of your eyes well in my mind Did you really have it trimmed just for me Yes and theres Rue de la Paix on the box if that means anything to you It meant nothing to her smiling at her reflection in the mirror Just at this moment nothing mattered to her except that she looked utterly charming in the first pretty hat she had put on her head in two years What she couldnt do with this hat And then her smile faded Dont you like it Oh its a dream but Oh I do hate to have to cover this lovely green with crpe and dye the feather black He was beside her quickly and his deft fingers untied the wide bow under her chin In a moment the hat was back in its box What are you doing You said it was mine But not to change to a mourning bonnet I shall find some other charming lady with green eyes who appreciates my taste Oh you shant Ill die if I dont have it Oh please Rhett dont be mean Let me have it And turn it into a fright like your other hats No She clutched at the box That sweet thing that made her look so young and enchanting to be given to some other girl Oh never For a moment she thought of the horror of Pitty and Melanie She thought of Ellen and what she would say and she shivered But vanity was stronger I wont change it I promise Now do let me have it He gave her the box with a slightly sardonic smile and watched her while she put it on again and preened herself How much is it she asked suddenly her face falling I have only fifty dollars but next month It would cost about two thousand dollars Confederate money he said with a grin at her woebegone expression Oh dear Well suppose I give you the fifty now and then when I get I dont want any money for it he said Its a gift Scarletts mouth dropped open The line was so closely so carefully drawn where gifts from men were concerned Candy and flowers dear Ellen had said time and again and perhaps a book of poetry or an album or a small bottle of Florida water are the only things a lady may accept from a gentleman Never never any expensive gift even from your fianc And never any gift of jewelry or wearing apparel not even gloves or handkerchiefs Should you accept such gifts men would know you were no lady and would try to take liberties Oh dear thought Scarlett looking first at herself in the mirror and then at Rhetts unreadable face I simply cant tell him I wont accept it Its too darling IdId almost rather he took a liberty if it was a very small one Then she was horrified at herself for having such a thought and she turned pink IllIll give you the fifty dollars If you do I will throw it in the gutter Or better still buy masses for your soul Im sure your soul could do with a few masses She laughed unwillingly and the laughing reflection under the green brim decided her instantly Whatever are you trying to do to me  Page    Gone With The Wind Im tempting you with fine gifts until your girlish ideals are quite worn away and you are at my mercy he said  Accept only candy and flowers from gentlemen dearie  he mimicked and she burst into a giggle You are a clever blackhearted wretch Rhett Butler and you know very well this bonnets too pretty to be refused His eyes mocked her even while they complimented her beauty Of course you can tell Miss Pitty that you gave me a sample of taffeta and green silk and drew a picture of the bonnet and I extorted fifty dollars from you for it No I shall say one hundred dollars and shell tell everybody in town and everybody will be green with envy and talk about my extravagance But Rhett you mustnt bring me anything else so expensive Its awfully kind of you but I really couldnt accept anything else Indeed Well I shall bring you presents so long as it pleases me and so long as I see things that will enhance your charms I shall bring you darkgreen watered silk for a frock to match the bonnet And I warn you that I am not kind I am tempting you with bonnets and bangles and leading you into a pit Always remember I never do anything without reason and I never give anything without expecting something in return I always get paid His black eyes sought her face and traveled to her lips Scarlett cast down her eyes excitement filling her Now he was going to try to take liberties just as Ellen predicted He was going to kiss her or try to kiss her and she couldnt quite make up her flurried mind which it should be If she refused he might jerk the bonnet right off her head and give it to some other girl On the other hand if she permitted one chaste peck he might bring her other lovely presents in the hope of getting another kiss Men set such a store by kisses though Heaven alone knew why And lots of times after one kiss they fell completely in love with a girl and made most entertaining spectacles of themselves provided the girl was clever and withheld her kisses after the first one It would be exciting to have Rhett Butler in love with her and admitting it and begging for a kiss or a smile Yes she would let him kiss her But he made no move to kiss her She gave him a sidelong glance from under her lashes and murmured encouragingly So you always get paid do you And what do you expect to get from me That remains to be seen Well if you think Ill marry you to pay for the bonnet I wont she said daringly and gave her head a saucy flirt that set the plume to bobbing His white teeth gleamed under his little mustache Madam you flatter yourself I do not want to marry you or anyone else I am not a marrying man Indeed she cried taken aback and now determined that he should take some liberty I dont even intend to kiss you either Then why is your mouth all pursed up in that ridiculous way Oh she cried as she caught a glimpse of herself and saw that her red lips were indeed in the proper pose for a kiss Oh she cried again losing her temper and stamping her foot You are the horridest man I have ever seen and I dont care if I never lay eyes on you again If you really felt that way youd stamp on the bonnet My what a passion you are in and its quite becoming as you probably know Come Scarlett stamp on the bonnet to show me what you think of me and my presents Dont you dare touch this bonnet she said clutching it by the bow and retreating He came after her laughing softly and took her hands in his Oh Scarlett you are so young you wring my heart he said And I shall kiss you as you seem to expect it and leaning down carelessly his mustache just grazed her cheek Now do you feel that you must slap me to preserve the proprieties Her lips mutinous she looked up into his eyes and saw so much amusement in their dark depths that she burst into laughter What a tease he was and how exasperating If he didnt want to marry her and didnt even want to kiss her what did he want If he wasnt in love with her why did he call so often and bring her presents Thats better he said Scarlett Im a bad influence on you and if you have any sense you will send me packingif you can Im very hard to get rid of But Im bad for you Are you Cant you see it Ever since I met you at the bazaar your career has been most shocking and Im to blame for most of it Who encouraged you to dance Who forced you to admit that you thought our glorious Cause was neither glorious nor sacred Who goaded you into admitting that you thought men were fools to die for highsounding principles Who has aided you in giving the old ladies plenty to gossip about Who is getting you out of mourning several years too soon And who to end all this has lured you into accepting a gift which no lady can accept and still remain a lady You flatter yourself Captain Butler I havent done anything so scandalous and Id have done everything you mentioned without your aid anyway I doubt that he said and his face went suddenly quiet and somber Youd still be the brokenhearted widow of Charles Hamilton and famed for your good deeds among the wounded Eventually however But she was not listening for she was regarding herself pleasedly in the mirror again thinking she would wear the bonnet to the hospital this very afternoon and take flowers to the convalescent officers That there was truth in his last words did not occur to her She did not see that Rhett had pried open the prison of her widowhood and set her free to queen it over unmarried girls when her days as a belle should have been long past Nor did she see that under his influence she had come a long way from Ellens teachings The change had been so gradual the flouting of one small convention seeming to have no connection with the flouting of another and none of them any connection with Rhett She did not realize that with his encouragement she had disregarded many of the sternest injunctions of her mother concerning the proprieties forgotten the difficult lessons in being a lady She only saw that the bonnet was the most becoming one she ever had that it had not cost her a penny and that Rhett must be in love with her whether he admitted it or not And she certainly intended to find a way to make him admit it  Page    Gone With The Wind The next day Scarlett was standing in front of the mirror with a comb in her hand and her mouth full of hairpins attempting a new coiffure which Maybelle fresh from a visit to her husband in Richmond had said was the rage at the Capital It was called Cats Rats and Mice and presented many difficulties The hair was parted in the middle and arranged in three rolls of graduating size on each side of the head the largest nearest the part being the cat The cat and the rat were easy to fix but the mice kept slipping out of her hairpins in an exasperating manner However she was determined to accomplish it for Rhett was coming to supper and he always noticed and commented upon any innovation of dress or hair As she struggled with her bushy obstinate locks perspiration beading her forehead she heard light running feet in the downstairs hall and knew that Melanie was home from the hospital As she heard her fly up the stairs two at a time she paused hairpin in midair realizing that something must be wrong for Melanie always moved as decorously as a dowager She went to the door and threw it open and Melanie ran in her face flushed and frightened looking like a guilty child There were tears on her cheeks her bonnet was hanging on her neck by the ribbons and her hoops swaying violently She was clutching something in her hand and the reek of heavy cheap perfume came into the room with her Oh Scarlett she cried shutting the door and sinking on the bed Is Auntie home yet She isnt Oh thank the Lord Scarlett Im so mortified I could die I nearly swooned and Scarlett Uncle Peter is threatening to tell Aunt Pitty  Tell what That I was talking to thatto MissMrs Melanie fanned her hot face with her handkerchief That woman with red hair named Belle Watling Why Melly cried Scarlett so shocked she could only stare Belle Watling was the redhaired woman she had seen on the street the first day she came to Atlanta and by now she was easily the most notorious woman in town Many prostitutes had flocked into Atlanta following the soldiers but Belle stood out above the rest due to her flaming hair and the gaudy overly fashionable dresses she wore She was seldom seen on Peachtree Street or in any nice neighborhood but when she did appear respectable women made haste to cross the street to remove themselves from her vicinity And Melanie had been talking with her No wonder Uncle Peter was outraged I shall die if Aunt Pitty finds out You know shell cry and tell everybody in town and Ill be disgraced sobbed Melanie And it wasnt my fault II couldnt run away from her It would have been so rude Scarlett II felt sorry for her Do you think Im bad for feeling that way But Scarlett was not concerned with the ethics of the matter Like most innocent and wellbred young women she had a devouring curiosity about prostitutes What did she want What does she talk like Oh she used awful grammar but I could see she was trying so hard to be elegant poor thing I came out of the hospital and Uncle Peter and the carriage werent waiting so I thought Id walk home And when I went by the Emersons yard there she was hiding behind the hedge Oh thank Heaven the Emersons are in Macon And she said Please Mrs Wilkes do speak a minute with me I dont know how she knew my name I knew I ought to run as hard as I could butwell Scarlett she looked so sad andwell sort of pleading And she had on a black dress and black bonnet and no paint and really looked decent but for that red hair And before I could answer she said I know I shouldnt speak to you but I tried to talk to that old peahen Mrs Elsing and she ran me away from the hospital  Did she really call her a peahen said Scarlett pleasedly and laughed Oh dont laugh It isnt funny It seems that Missthis woman wanted to do something for the hospitalcan you imagine it She offered to nurse every morning and of course Mrs Elsing must have nearly died at the idea and ordered her out of the hospital And then she said I want to do something too Aint I a Confedrut good as you And Scarlett I was right touched at her wanting to help You know she cant be all bad if she wants to help the Cause Do you think Im bad to feel that way For Heavens sake Melly who cares if youre bad What else did she say She said shed been watching the ladies go by to the hospital and thought I hadaa kind face and so she stopped me She had some money and she wanted me to take it and use it for the hospital and not tell a soul where it came from She said Mrs Elsing wouldnt let it be used if she knew what kind of money it was What kind of money Thats when I thought Id swoon And I was so upset and anxious to get away I just said Oh yes indeed how sweet of you or something idiotic and she smiled and said Thats right Christian of you and shoved this duty handkerchief into my hand Ugh can you smell the perfume Melanie held out a mans handkerchief soiled and highly perfumed in which some coins were knotted She was saying thank you and something about bringing me some money every week and just then Uncle Peter drove up and saw me Melly collapsed into tears and laid her head on the pillow And when he saw who was with me heScarlett he hollered at me Nobody has ever hollered at me before in my whole life And he said You git in dis ayah cahige dis minute Of course I did and all the way home he blessed me out and wouldnt let me explain and said he was going to tell Aunt Pitty Scarlett do go down and beg him not to tell her Perhaps he will listen to you It will kill Auntie if she knows I ever even looked that woman in the face Will you Yes I will But lets see how much money is in here It feels heavy She untied the knot and a handful of gold coins rolled out on the bed Scarlett theres fifty dollars here And in gold cried Melanie awed as she counted the bright pieces Tell me do you think its all right to use this kindwell money madeerthis way for the boys Dont you think that maybe God will understand that she wanted to help and wont care if it is tainted When I think of how many things the hospital needs But Scarlett was not listening She was looking at the dirty handkerchief and humiliation and fury were filling her There was a monogram in the corner in which were the initials R K B In her top drawer was a handkerchief just like this one that Rhett Butler had lent her only yesterday to wrap about the stems of wild flowers they had picked She had planned to return it to him when he came to supper tonight So Rhett consorted with that vile Watling creature and gave her money That was where the contribution to the hospital came from Blockade gold And to think that Rhett would have the gall to look a decent woman in the face after being with that creature  Page    Gone With The Wind And to think that she could have believed he was in love with her This proved he couldnt be Bad women and all they involved were mysterious and revolting matters to her She knew that men patronized these women for purposes which no lady should mentionor if she did mention them in whispers and by indirection and euphemism She had always thought that only common vulgar men visited such women Before this moment it had never occurred to her that nice menthat is men she met at nice homes and with whom she dancedcould possibly do such things It opened up an entirely new field of thought and one that was horrifying Perhaps all men did this It was bad enough that they forced their wives to go through such indecent performances but to actually seek out low women and pay them for such accommodation Oh men were so vile and Rhett Butler was the worst of them all She would take this handkerchief and fling it in his face and show him the door and never never speak to him again But no of course she couldnt do that She could never never let him know she even realized that bad women existed much less that he visited them A lady could never do that Oh she thought in fury If I just wasnt a lady what wouldnt I tell that varmint And crumbling the handkerchief in her hand she went down the stairs to the kitchen in search of Uncle Peter As she passed the stove she shoved the handkerchief into the flames and with impotent anger watched it burn CHAPTER XIV HOPE WAS ROLLING HIGH in every Southern heart as the summer of  came in Despite privation and hardships despite food speculators and kindred scourges despite death and sickness and suffering which had now left their mark on nearly every family the South was again saying One more victory and the war is over saying it with even more happy assurance than in the summer before The Yankees were proving a hard nut to crack but they were cracking at last Christmas of  had been a happy one for Atlanta for the whole South The Confederacy had scored a smashing victory at Fredericksburg and the Yankee dead and wounded were counted in the thousands There was universal rejoicing in that holiday season rejoicing and thankfulness that the tide was turning The army in butternut were now seasoned fighters their generals had proven their mettle and everyone knew that when the campaign reopened in the spring the Yankees would be crushed for good and all Spring came and the fighting recommenced May came and the Confederacy won another great victory at Chancellorsville The South roared with elation Closer at home a Union cavalry dash into Georgia had been turned into a Confederate triumph Folks were still laughing and slapping each other on the back and saying Yes sir When old Nathan Bedford Forrest gets after them they better git Late in April Colonel Straight and eighteen hundred Yankee cavalry had made a surprise raid into Georgia aiming at Rome only a little more than sixty miles north of Atlanta They had ambitious plans to cut the vitally important railroad between Atlanta and Tennessee and then swing southward into Atlanta to destroy the factories and the war supplies concentrated there in that key city of the Confederacy It was a bold stroke and it would have cost the South dearly except for Forrest With only onethird as many menbut what men and what ridershe had started after them engaged them before they even reached Rome harassed them day and night and finally captured the entire force The news reached Atlanta almost simultaneously with the news of the victory at Chancellorsville and the town fairly rocked with exultation and with laughter Chancellorsville might be a more important victory but the capture of Streights raiders made the Yankees positively ridiculous No sir theyd better not fool with old Forrest Atlanta said gleefully as the story was told over and over The tide of the Confederacys fortune was running strong and full now sweeping the people jubilantly along on its flood True the Yankees under Grant had been besieging Vicksburg since the middle of May True the South had suffered a sickening loss when Stonewall Jackson had been fatally wounded at Chancellorsville True Georgia had lost one of her bravest and most brilliant sons when General T R R Cobb had been killed at Fredericksburg But the Yankees just couldnt stand any more defeats like Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville Theyd have to give in and then this cruel war would be over The first days of July came and with them the rumor later confirmed by dispatches that Lee was marching into Pennsylvania Lee in the enemys territory Lee forcing battle This was the last fight of the war Atlanta was wild with excitement pleasure and a hot thirst for vengeance Now the Yankees would know what it meant to have the war carried into their own country Now theyd know what it meant to have fertile fields stripped horses and cattle stolen houses burned old men and boys dragged off to prison and women and children turned out to starve Everyone knew what the Yankees had done in Missouri Kentucky Tennessee and Virginia Even small children could recite with hate and fear the horrors the Yankees had inflicted upon the conquered territory Already Atlanta was full of refugees from east Tennessee and the town had heard firsthand stories from them of what suffering they had gone through In that section the Confederate sympathizers were in the minority and the hand of war fell heavily upon them as it did on all the border states neighbor informing against neighbor and brother killing brother These refugees cried out to see Pennsylvania one solid sheet of flame and even the gentlest of old ladies wore expressions of grim pleasure But when the news trickled back that Lee had issued orders that no private property in Pennsylvania should be touched that looting would be punished by death and that the army would pay for every article it requisitionedthen it needed all the reverence the General had earned to save his popularity Not turn the men loose in the rich storehouses of that prosperous state What was General Lee thinking of And our boys so hungry and needing shoes and clothes and horses A hasty note from Darcy Meade to the doctor the only firsthand information Atlanta received during those first days of July was passed from hand to hand with mounting indignation Pa could you manage to get me a pair of boots Ive been barefooted for two weeks now and I dont see any prospects of getting another pair If I didnt have such big feet I could get them off dead Yankees like the other boys but Ive never yet found  Page    Gone With The Wind a Yankee whose feet were near as big as mine If you can get me some dont mail them Somebody would steal them on the way and I wouldnt blame them Put Phil on the train and send him up with them Ill write you soon where well be Right now I dont know except that were marching north Were in Maryland now and everybody says were going on into Pennsylvania  Pa I thought that wed give the Yanks a taste of their own medicine but the General says No and personally I dont care to get shot just for the pleasure of burning some Yanks house Pa today we marched through the grandest cornfields you ever saw We dont have corn like this down home Well I must admit we did a bit of private looting in that corn for we were all pretty hungry and what the General dont know wont hurt him But that green corn didnt do us a bit of good All the boys have got dysentery anyway and that corn made it worse Its easier to walk with a leg wound than with dysentery Pa do try to manage some boots for me Im a captain now and a captain ought to have boots even if be hasnt got a new uniform or epaulets But the army was in Pennsylvaniathat was all that mattered One more victory and the war would be over and then Darcy Meade could have all the boots he wanted and the boys would come marching home and everybody would be happy again Mrs Meades eyes grew wet as she pictured her soldier son home at last home to stay On the third of July a sudden silence fell on the wires from the north a silence that lasted till midday of the fourth when fragmentary and garbled reports began to trickle into headquarters in Atlanta There had been hard fighting in Pennsylvania near a little town named Gettysburg a great battle with all Lees army massed The news was uncertain slow in coming for the battle had been fought in the enemys territory and the reports came first through Maryland were relayed to Richmond and then to Atlanta Suspense grew and the beginnings of dread slowly crawled over the town Nothing was so bad as not knowing what was happening Families with sons at the front prayed fervently that their boys were not in Pennsylvania but those who knew their relatives were in the same regiment with Darcy Meade clamped their teeth and said it was an honor for them to be in the big fight that would lick the Yankees for good and all In Aunt Pittys house the three women looked into one anothers eyes with fear they could not conceal Ashley was in Darcys regiment On the fifth came evil tidings not from the North but from the West Vicksburg had fallen fallen after a long and bitter siege and practically all the Mississippi River from St Louis to New Orleans was in the hands of the Yankees The Confederacy had been cut in two At any other time the news of this disaster would have brought fear and lamentation to Atlanta But now they could give little thought to Vicksburg They were thinking of Lee in Pennsylvania forcing battle Vicksburgs loss would be no catastrophe if Lee won in the East There lay Philadelphia New York Washington Their capture would paralyze the North and more than cancel off the defeat on the Mississippi The hours dragged by and the black shadow of calamity brooded over the town obscuring the hot sun until people looked up startled into the sky as if incredulous that it was clear and blue instead of murky and heavy with scudding clouds Everywhere women gathered in knots huddled in groups on front porches on sidewalks even in the middle of the streets telling each other that no news is good news trying to comfort each other trying to present a brave appearance But hideous rumors that Lee was killed the battle lost and enormous casualty lists coming in fled up and down the quiet streets like darting bats Though they tried not to believe whole neighborhoods swayed by panic rushed to town to the newspapers to headquarters pleading for news any news even bad news Crowds formed at the depot hoping for news from incoming trains at the telegraph office in front of the harried headquarters before the locked doors of the newspapers They were oddly still crowds crowds that quietly grew larger and larger There was no talking Occasionally an old mans treble voice begged for news and instead of inciting the crowd to babbling it only intensified the hush as they heard the oftrepeated Nothing on the wires yet from the North except that theres been fighting The fringe of women on foot and in carriages grew greater and greater and the heat of the closepacked bodies and dust rising from restless feet were suffocating The women did not speak but their pale set faces pleaded with a mute eloquence that was louder than wailing There was hardly a house in town that had not sent away a son a brother a father a lover a husband to this battle They all waited to hear the news that death had come to their homes They expected death They did not expect defeat That thought they dismissed Their men might be dying even now on the sunparched grass of the Pennsylvania hills Even now the Southern ranks might be falling like grain before a hailstorm but the Cause for which they fought could never fall They might be dying in thousands but like the fruit of the dragons teeth thousands of fresh men in gray and butternut with the Rebel yell on their lips would spring up from the earth to take their places Where these men would come from no one knew They only knew as surely as they knew there was a just and jealous God in Heaven that Lee was miraculous and the Army of Virginia invincible Scarlett Melanie and Miss Pittypat sat in front of the Daily Examiner office in the carriage with the top back sheltered beneath their parasols Scarletts hands shook so that her parasol wobbled above her head Pitty was so excited her nose quivered in her round face like a rabbits but Melanie sat as though carved of stone her dark eyes growing larger and larger as time went by She made only one remark in two hours as she took a vial of smelling salts from her reticule and handed it to her aunt the only time she had ever spoken to her in her whole life with anything but tenderest affection Take this Auntie and use it if you feel faint I warn you if you do faint youll just have to faint and let Uncle Peter take you home for Im not going to leave this place till I hear abouttill I hear And Im not going to let Scarlett leave me either Scarlett had no intention of leaving no intention of placing herself where she could not have the first news of Ashley No even if Miss Pitty died she wouldnt leave this spot Somewhere Ashley was fighting perhaps dying and the newspaper office was the only place where she could learn the truth She looked about the crowd picking out friends and neighbors Mrs Meade with her bonnet askew and her arm though that of fifteenyearold Phil the Misses McLure trying to make their trembling upper lips cover their buck teeth Mrs Elsing erect as a Spartan mother betraying her inner turmoil only by the straggling gray locks that hung from her chignon and Fanny Elsing  Page    Gone With The Wind white as a ghost Surely Fanny wouldnt be so worried about her brother Hugh Had she a real beau at the front that no one suspected Mrs Merriwether sat in her carriage patting Maybelles hand Maybelle looked so very pregnant it was a disgrace for her to be out in public even if she did have her shawl carefully draped over her Why should she be so worried Nobody had heard that the Louisiana troops were in Pennsylvania Probably her hairy little Zouave was safe in Richmond this very minute There was a movement on the outskirts of the crowd and those on foot gave way as Rhett Butler carefully edged his horse toward Aunt Pittys carriage Scarlett thought Hes got courage coming here at this time when it wouldnt take anything to make this mob tear him to pieces because he isnt in uniform As he came nearer she thought she might be the first to rend him How dared he sit there on that fine horse in shining boots and handsome white linen suit so sleek and well fed smoking an expensive cigar when Ashley and all the other boys were fighting the Yankees barefooted sweltering in the heat hungry their bellies rotten with disease Bitter looks were thrown at him as he came slowly through the press Old men growled in their beards and Mrs Merriwether who feared nothing rose slightly in her carriage and said clearly Speculator in a tone that made the word the foulest and most venomous of epithets He paid no heed to anyone but raised his hat to Melly and Aunt Pitty and riding to Scarletts side leaned down and whispered Dont you think this would be the time for Dr Meade to give us his familiar speech about victory perching like a screaming eagle on our banners Her nerves taut with suspense she turned on him as swiftly as an angry cat hot words bubbling to her lips but he stopped them with a gesture I came to tell you ladies he said loudly that I have been to headquarters and the first casualty lists are coming in At these words a hum rose among those near enough to hear his remark and the crowd surged ready to turn and run down Whitehall Street toward headquarters Dont go he called rising in his saddle and holding up his hand The lists have been sent to both newspapers and are now being printed Stay where you are Oh Captain Butler cried Melly turning to him with tears in her eyes How kind of you to come and tell us When will they be posted They should be out any minute Madam The reports have been in the offices for half an hour now The major in charge didnt want to let that out until the printing was done for fear the crowd would wreck the offices trying to get news Ah Look The side window of the newspaper office opened and a hand was extended bearing a sheaf of long narrow galley proofs smeared with fresh ink and thick with names closely printed The crowd fought for them tearing the slips in half those obtaining them trying to back out through the crowd to read those behind pushing forward crying Let me through Hold the reins said Rhett shortly swinging to the ground and tossing the bridle to Uncle Peter They saw his heavy shoulders towering above the crowd as he went through brutally pushing and shoving In a while he was back with half a dozen in his hands He tossed one to Melanie and distributed the others among the ladies in the nearest carriages the Misses McLure Mrs Meade Mrs Merriwether Mrs Elsing Quick Melly cried Scarlett her heart in her throat exasperation sweeping her as she saw that Mellys hands were shaking so that it was impossible for her to read Take it whispered Melly and Scarlett snatched it from her The W s Where were the W s Oh there they were at the bottom and all smeared up White she read and her voice shook Wilkens  Winn  Zebulon  Oh Melly hes not on it Hes not on it Oh for Gods sake Auntie Melly pick up the salts Hold her up Melly Melly weeping openly with happiness steadied Miss Pittys rolling head and held the smelling salts under her nose Scarlett braced the fat old lady on the other side her heart singing with joy Ashley was alive He wasnt even wounded How good God was to pass him by How She heard a low moan and turning saw Fanny Elsing lay her head on her mothers bosom saw the casualty list flutter to the floor of the carriage saw Mrs Elsings thin lips quiver as she gathered her daughter in her arms and said quietly to the coachman Home Quickly Scarlett took a quick glance at the lists Hugh Elsing was not listed Fanny must have had a beau and now he was dead The crowd made way in sympathetic silence for the Elsings carriage and after them followed the little wicker pony cart of the McLure girls Miss Faith was driving her face like a rock and for once her teeth were covered by her lips Miss Hope death in her face sat erect beside her holding her sisters skirt in a tight grasp They looked like very old women Their young brother Dallas was their darling and the only relative the maiden ladies had in the world Dallas was gone Melly Melly cried Maybelle joy in her voice Ren is safe And Ashley too Oh thank God The shawl had slipped from her shoulders and her condition was most obvious but for once neither she nor Mrs Merriwether cared Oh Mrs Meade Ren Her voice changed swiftly Melly lookMrs Meade please Darcy isnt Mrs Meade was looking down into her lap and she did not raise her head when her name was called but the face of little Phil beside her was an open book that all might read There there Mother he said helplessly Mrs Meade looked up meeting Melanies eyes He wont need those boots now she said Oh darling cried Melly beginning to sob as she shoved Aunt Pitty onto Scarletts shoulder and scrambled out of the carriage and toward that of the doctors wife Mother youve still got me said Phil in a forlorn effort at comforting the whitefaced woman beside him And if youll just let me Ill go kill all the Yank Mrs Meade clutched his arm as if she would never let it go said No in a strangled voice and seemed to choke Phil Meade you hush your mouth hissed Melanie climbing in beside Mrs Meade and taking her in her arms Do you think itll help your mother to have you off getting shot too I never heard anything so silly Drive us home quick She turned to Scarlett as Phil picked up the reins As soon as you take Auntie home come over to Mrs Meades Captain Butler can you get word to the doctor Hes at the hospital  Page    Gone With The Wind The carriage moved off through the dispersing crowd Some of the women were weeping with joy but most looked too stunned to realize the heavy blows that had fallen upon them Scarlett bent her head over the blurred lists reading rapidly to find names of friends Now that Ashley was safe she could think of other people Oh how long the list was How heavy the toll from Atlanta from all of Georgia Good Heavens CalvertRaiford Lieutenant Raif Suddenly she remembered the day so long ago when they had run away together but decided to come home at nightfall because they were hungry and afraid of the dark FontaineJoseph K private Little badtempered Joe And Sally hardly over having her baby MunroeLaFayette Captain And Lafe had been engaged to Cathleen Calvert Poor Cathleen Hers had been a double loss a brother and a sweetheart But Sallys loss was greatera brother and a husband Oh this was too terrible She was almost afraid to read further Aunt Pitty was heaving and sighing on her shoulder and with small ceremony Scarlett pushed her over into a comer of the carriage and continued her reading Surely surelythere couldnt be three Tarleton names on that list Perhapsperhaps the hurried printer had repeated the name by error But no There they were TarletonBrenton Lieutenant TarletonStuart Corporal TarletonThomas private And Boyd dead the first year of the war was buried God knew where in Virginia All the Tarleton boys gone Tom and the lazy longlegged twins with their love of gossip and their absurd practical jokes and Boyd who had the grace of a dancing master and the tongue of a wasp She could not read any more She could not know if any other of those boys with whom she had grown up danced flirted kissed were on that list She wished that she could cry do something to ease the iron fingers that were digging into her throat Im sorry Scarlett said Rhett She looked up at him She had forgotten he was still there Many of your friends She nodded and struggled to speak About every family in the Countyand allall three of the Tarleton boys His face was quiet almost somber and there was no mocking in his eyes And the end is not yet he said These are just the first lists and theyre incomplete Therell be a longer list tomorrow He lowered his voice so that those in the nearby carriages could not hear Scarlett General Lee must have lost the battle I heard at headquarters that he had retreated back into Maryland She raised frightened eyes to his but her fear did not spring from Lees defeat Longer casualty lists tomorrow Tomorrow She had not thought of tomorrow so happy was she at first that Ashleys name was not on that list Tomorrow Why right this minute he might be dead and she would not know it until tomorrow or perhaps a week from tomorrow Oh Rhett why do there have to be wars It would have been so much better for the Yankees to pay for the darkiesor even for us to give them the darkies free of charge than to have this happen It isnt the darkies Scarlett Theyre just the excuse Therell always be wars because men love wars Women dont but men doyea passing the love of women His mouth twisted in his old smile and the seriousness was gone from his face He lifted his wide Panama hat Goodby Im going to find Dr Meade I imagine the irony of me being the one to tell him of his sons death will be lost on him just now But later hell probably hate to think that a speculator brought the news of a heros death Scarlett put Miss Pitty to bed with a toddy left Prissy and Cookie in attendance and went down the street to the Meade house Mrs Meade was upstairs with Phil waiting her husbands return and Melanie sat in the parlor talking in a low voice to a group of sympathetic neighbors She was busy with needle and scissors altering a mourning dress that Mrs Elsing had lent to Mrs Meade Already the house was full of the acrid smell of clothes boiling in homemade black dye for in the kitchen the sobbing cook was stirring all of Mrs Meades dresses in the huge wash pot How is she questioned Scarlett softly Not a tear said Melanie Its terrible when women cant cry I dont know how men stand things without crying I guess its because theyre stronger and braver than women She says shes going to Pennsylvania by herself to bring him home The doctor cant leave the hospital It will be dreadful for her Why cant Phil go Shes afraid hell join the army if he gets out of her sight You know hes so big for his age and theyre taking them at sixteen now One by one the neighbors slipped away reluctant to be present when the doctor came home and Scarlett and Melanie were left alone sewing in the parlor Melanie looked sad but tranquil though tears dropped down on the cloth she held in her hands Evidently she had not thought that the battle might still be going on and Ashley perhaps dead at this very moment With panic in her heart Scarlett did not know whether to tell Melanie of Rhetts words and have the dubious comfort of her misery or keep it to herself Finally she decided to remain quiet It would never do for Melanie to think her too worried about Ashley She thanked God that everyone Melly and Pitty included had been too engrossed in her own worries that morning to notice her conduct After an interval of silent sewing they heard sounds outside and peering through the curtains they saw Dr Meade alighting from his horse His shoulders were sagging and his head bowed until his gray beard spread out fanlike on his chest He came slowly into the house and laying down his hat and bag kissed both the girls silently Then he went tiredly up the stairs In a moment Phil came down all long legs and arms and awkwardness The two girls looked an invitation to join them but he went onto the front porch and seating himself on the top step dropped his head on his cupped palm Melly sighed Hes mad because they wont let him go fight the Yankees Fifteen years old Oh Scarlett it would be Heaven to have a son like that And have him get killed said Scarlett shortly thinking of Darcy It would be better to have a son even if he did get killed than to never have one said Melanie and gulped You cant understand Scarlett because youve got little Wade but I Oh Scarlett I want a baby so bad I know you think Im horrid to say it right out but its true and only what every woman wants and you know it  Page    Gone With The Wind Scarlett restrained herself from sniffing If God should will that Ashley should betaken I suppose I could bear it though Id rather die if he died But God would give me strength to bear it But I could not bear having him dead and not havingnot having a child of his to comfort me Oh Scarlett how lucky you are Though you lost Charlie you have his son And if Ashley goes Ill have nothing Scarlett forgive me but sometimes Ive been so jealous of you Jealousof me cried Scarlett stricken with guilt Because you have a son and I havent Ive even pretended sometimes that Wade was mine because its so awful not to have a child Fiddledeedee said Scarlett in relief She cast a quick glance at the slight figure with blushing face bent over the sewing Melanie might want children but she certainly did not have the figure for bearing them She was hardly taller than a twelveyearold child her hips were as narrow as a childs and her breasts were very flat The very thought of Melanie having a child was repellent to Scarlett It brought up too many thoughts she couldnt bear thinking If Melanie should have a child of Ashleys it would be as though something were taken from Scarlett that was her own Do forgive me for saying that about Wade You know I love him so You arent mad at me are you Dont be silly said Scarlett shortly And go out on the porch and do something for Phil Hes crying CHAPTER XV THE ARMY driven back into Virginia went into winter quarters on the Rapidana tired depleted army since the defeat at Gettysburgand as the Christmas season approached Ashley came home on furlough Scarlett seeing him for the first time in more than two years was frightened by the violence of her feelings When she had stood in the parlor at Twelve Oaks and seen him married to Melanie she had thought she could never love him with a more heartbreaking intensity than she did at that moment But now she knew her feelings of that longpast night were those of a spoiled child thwarted of a toy Now her emotions were sharpened by her long dreams of him heightened by the repression she had been forced to put on her tongue This Ashley Wilkes in his faded patched uniform his blond hair bleached tow by summer suns was a different man from the easygoing drowsyeyed boy she had loved to desperation before the war And he was a thousand times more thrilling He was bronzed and lean now where he had once been fair and slender and the long golden mustache drooping about his mouth cavalry style was the last touch needed to make him the perfect picture of a soldier He stood with military straightness in his old uniform his pistol in its worn holster his battered scabbard smartly slapping his high boots his tarnished spurs dully gleamingMajor Ashley Wilkes CSA The habit of command sat upon him now a quiet air of selfreliance and authority and grim lines were beginning to emerge about his mouth There was something new and strange about the square set of his shoulders and the cool bright gleam of his eyes Where he had once been lounging and indolent he was now as alert as a prowling cat with the tense alertness of one whose nerves are perpetually drawn as tight as the strings of a violin In his eyes there was a fagged haunted look and the sunburned skin was tight across the fine bones of his faceher same handsome Ashley yet so very different Scarlett had made her plans to spend Christmas at Tara but after Ashleys telegram came no power on earth not even a direct command from the disappointed Ellen could drag her away from Atlanta Had Ashley intended going to Twelve Oaks she would have hastened to Tara to be near him but he had written his family to join him in Atlanta and Mr Wilkes and Honey and India were already in town Go home to Tara and miss seeing him after two long years Miss the heartquickening sound of his voice miss reading in his eyes that he had not forgotten her Never Not for all the mothers in the world Ashley came home four days before Christmas with a group of the County boys also on furlough a sadly diminished group since Gettysburg Cade Calvert was among them a thin gaunt Cade who coughed continually two of the Munroe boys bubbling with the excitement of their first leave since  and Alex and Tony Fontaine splendidly drunk boisterous and quarrelsome The group had two hours to wait between trains and as it was taxing the diplomacy of the sober members of the party to keep the Fontaines from fighting each other and perfect strangers in the depot Ashley brought them all home to Aunt Pittypats Youd think theyd had enough fighting in Virginia said Cade bitterly as he watched the two bristle like gamecocks over who should be the first to kiss the fluttering and flattered Aunt Pitty But no Theyve been drunk and picking fights ever since we got to Richmond The provost guard took them up there and if it hadnt been for Ashleys slick tongue theyd have spent Christmas in jail But Scarlett hardly heard a word he said so enraptured was she at being in the same room with Ashley again How could she have thought during these two years that other men were nice or handsome or exciting How could she have even endured hearing them make love to her when Ashley was in the world He was home again separated from her only by the width of the parlor rug and it took all her strength not to dissolve in happy tears every time she looked at him sitting there on the sofa with Melly on one side and India on the other and Honey hanging over his shoulder If only she had the right to sit there beside him her arm through his If only she could pat his sleeve every few minutes to make sure he was really there hold his hand and use his handkerchief to wipe away her tears of joy For Melanie was doing all these things unashamedly Too happy to be shy and reserved she hung on her husbands arm and adored him openly with her eyes with her smiles her tears And Scarlett was too happy to resent this too glad to be jealous Ashley was home at last Now and then she put her hand up to her cheek where he had kissed her and felt again the thrill of his lips and smiled at him He had not kissed her first of course Melly had hurled herself into his arms crying incoherently holding him as though she would never let him go And then India and Honey had hugged him fairly tearing him from Melanies arms Then he had kissed his father with a dignified affectionate embrace that showed the strong quiet feeling that lay between them And then Aunt Pitty who was jumping up and down on her inadequate little feet with excitement Finally he turned to her surrounded by all the boys who were claiming their kisses and said Oh Scarlett You pretty pretty thing and kissed her on the cheek  Page    Gone With The Wind With that kiss everything she had intended to say in welcome took wings Not until hours later did she recall that he had not kissed her on the lips Then she wondered feverishly if he would have done it had she met him alone bending his tall body over hers pulling her up on tiptoe holding her for a long long time And because it made her happy to think so she believed that he would But there would be time for all things a whole week Surely she could maneuver to get him alone and say Do you remember those rides we used to take down our secret bridle paths Do you remember how the moon looked that night when we sat on the steps at Tara and you quoted that poem Good Heavens What was the name of that poem anyway Do you remember that afternoon when I sprained my ankle and you carried me home in your arms in the twilight Oh there were so many things she would preface with Do you remember So many dear memories that would bring back to him those lovely days when they roamed the County like carefree children so many things that would call to mind the days before Melanie Hamilton entered on the scene And while they talked she could perhaps read in his eyes some quickening of emotion some hint that behind the barrier of husbandly affection for Melanie he still cared cared as passionately as on that day of the barbecue when he burst forth with the truth It did not occur to her to plan just what they would do if Ashley should declare his love for her in unmistakable words It would be enough to know that he did care  Yes she could wait could let Melanie have her happy hour of squeezing his arm and crying Her time would come After all what did a girl like Melanie know of love Darling you look like a ragamuffin said Melanie when the first excitement of homecoming was over Who did mend your uniform and why did they use blue patches I thought I looked perfectly dashing said Ashley considering his appearance Just compare me with those ragtags over there and youll appreciate me more Mose mended the uniform and I thought he did very well considering that hed never had a needle in his hand before the war About the blue cloth when it comes to a choice between having holes in your britches or patching them with pieces of a captured Yankee uniformwell there just isnt any choice And as for looking like a ragamuffin you should thank your stars your husband didnt come home barefooted Last week my old boots wore completely out and I would have come home with sacks tied on my feet if we hadnt had the good luck to shoot two Yankee scouts The boots of one of them fitted me perfectly He stretched out his long legs in their scarred high boots for them to admire And the boots of the other scout didnt fit me said Cade Theyre two sizes too small and theyre killing me this minute But Im going home in style just the same And the selfish swine wont give them to either of us said Tony And theyd fit our small aristocratic Fontaine feet perfectly Hells afire Im ashamed to face Mother in these brogans Before the war she wouldnt have let one of our darkies wear them Dont worry said Alex eyeing Cades boots Well take them off of him on the train going home I dont mind facing Mother but Im daI mean I dont intend for Dimity Munroe to see my toes sticking out Why theyre my boots I claimed them first said Tony beginning to scowl at his brother and Melanie fluttering with fear at the possibility of one of the famous Fontaine quarrels interposed and made peace I had a full beard to show you girls said Ashley ruefully rubbing his face where halfhealed razor nicks still showed It was a beautiful beard and if I do say it myself neither Jeb Stuart nor Nathan Bedford Forrest had a handsomer one But when we got to Richmond those two scoundrels indicating the Fontaines decided that as they were shaving their beards mine should come off too They got me down and shaved me and its a wonder my head didnt come off along with the beard It was only by the intervention of Evan and Cade that my mustache was saved Snakes Mrs Wilkes You ought to thank me Youd never have recognized him and wouldnt have let him in the door said Alex We did it to show our appreciation of his talking the provost guard out of putting us in jail If you say the word well take the mustache off for you right now Oh no thank you said Melanie hastily clutching Ashley in a frightened way for the two swarthy little men looked capable of any violence I think its perfectly lovely Thats love said the Fontaines nodding gravely at each other When Ashley went into the cold to see the boys off to the depot in Aunt Pittys carriage Melanie caught Scarletts arm Isnt his uniform dreadful Wont my coat be a surprise Oh if only I had enough cloth for britches too That coat for Ashley was a sore subject with Scarlett for she wished so ardently that she and not Melanie were bestowing it as a Christmas gift Gray wool for uniforms was now almost literally more priceless than rubies and Ashley was wearing the familiar homespun Even butternut was now none too plentiful and many of the soldiers were dressed in captured Yankee uniforms which had been turned a darkbrown color with walnutshell dye But Melanie by rare luck had come into possession of enough gray broadcloth to make a coata rather short coat but a coat just the same She had nursed a Charleston boy in the hospital and when he died had clipped a lock of his hair and sent it to his mother along with the scant contents of his pockets and a comforting account of his last hours which made no mention of the torment in which he died A correspondence had sprung up between them and learning that Melanie had a husband at the front the mother had sent her the length of gray cloth and brass buttons which she had bought for her dead son It was a beautiful piece of material thick and warm and with a dull sheen to it undoubtedly blockade goods and undoubtedly very expensive It was now in the hands of the tailor and Melanie was hurrying him to have it ready by Christmas morning Scarlett would have given anything to be able to provide the rest of the uniform but the necessary materials were simply not to be had in Atlanta She had a Christmas present for Ashley but it paled in insignificance beside the glory of Melanies gray coat It was a small housewife made of flannel containing the whole precious pack of needles Rhett had brought her from Nassau three of her linen handkerchiefs obtained from the same source two spools of thread and a small pair of scissors But she wanted to give him something more personal something a wife could give a husband a shirt a pair of gauntlets a hat Oh yes a hat by all means That little flattopped forage cap Ashley was wearing looked ridiculous Scarlett had always hated them What if Stonewall Jackson had worn one in preference to a slouch felt That didnt make them any more dignified looking But the only hats obtainable in Atlanta were crudely made wool hats and they were tackier than the monkeyhat forage caps  Page    Gone With The Wind When she thought of hats she thought of Rhett Butler He had so many hats wide Panamas for summer tall beavers for formal occasions hunting hats slouch hats of tan and black and blue What need had he for so many when her darling Ashley rode in the rain with moisture dripping down his collar from the back of his cap Ill make Rhett give me that new black felt of his she decided And Ill put a gray ribbon around the brim and sew Ashleys wreath on it and it will look lovely She paused and thought it might be difficult to get the hat without some explanation She simply could not tell Rhett she wanted it for Ashley He would raise his brows in that nasty way he always had when she even mentioned Ashleys name and like as not would refuse to give her the hat Well shed make up some pitiful story about a soldier in the hospital who needed it and Rhett need never know the truth All that afternoon she maneuvered to be alone with Ashley even for a few minutes but Melanie was beside him constantly and India and Honey their pale lashless eyes glowing followed him about the house Even John Wilkes visibly proud of his son had no opportunity for quiet conversation with him It was the same at supper where they all plied him with questions about the war The war Who cared about the war Scarlett didnt think Ashley cared very much for that subject either He talked at length laughed frequently and dominated the conversation more completely than she had ever seen him do before but he seemed to say very little He told them jokes and funny stories about friends talked gaily about makeshifts making light of hunger and long marches in the rain and described in detail how General Lee had looked when he rode by on the retreat from Gettysburg and questioned Gentlemen are you Georgia troops Well we cant get along without you Georgians It seemed to Scarlett that he was talking fervishly to keep them from asking questions he did not want to answer When she saw his eyes falter and drop before the long troubled gaze of his father a faint worry and bewilderment rose in her as to what was hidden in Ashleys heart But it soon passed for there was no room in her mind for anything except a radiant happiness and a driving desire to be alone with him That radiance lasted until everyone in the circle about the open fire began to yawn and Mr Wilkes and the girls took their departure for the hotel Then as Ashley and Melanie and Pittypat and Scarlett mounted the stairs lighted by Uncle Peter a chill fell on her spirit Until that moment when they stood in the upstairs hall Ashley had been hers only hers even if she had not had a private word with him that whole afternoon But now as she said good night she saw that Melanies cheeks were suddenly crimson and she was trembling Her eyes were on the carpet and though she seemed overcome with some frightening emotion she seemed shyly happy Melanie did not even look up when Ashley opened the bedroom door but sped inside Ashley said good night abruptly and he did not meet Scarletts eyes either The door closed behind them leaving Scarlett open mouthed and suddenly desolate Ashley was no longer hers He was Melanies And as long as Melanie lived she could go into rooms with Ashley and close the doorand close out the rest of the world Now Ashley was going away back to Virginia back to the long marches in the sleet to hungry bivouacs in the snow to pain and hardship and to the risk of all the bright beauty of his golden head and proud slender body being blotted out in an instant like an ant beneath a careless heel The past week with its shimmering dreamlike beauty its crowded hours of happiness was gone The week had passed swiftly like a dream a dream fragrant with the smell of pine boughs and Christmas trees bright with little candles and homemade tinsel a dream where minutes flew as rapidly as heartbeats Such a breathless week when something within her drove Scarlett with mingled pain and pleasure to pack and cram every minute with incidents to remember after he was gone happenings which she could examine at leisure in the long months ahead extracting every morsel of comfort from themdance sing laugh fetch and carry for Ashley anticipate his wants smile when he smiles be silent when he talks follow him with your eyes so that each line of his erect body each lift of his eyebrows each quirk of his mouth will be indelibly printed on your mindfor a week goes by so fast and the war goes on forever She sat on the divan in the parlor holding her goingaway gift for him in her lap waiting while he said goodby to Melanie praying that when he did come down the stairs he would be alone and she might be granted by Heaven a few moments alone with him Her ears strained for sounds from upstairs but the house was oddly still so still that even the sound of her breathing seemed loud Aunt Pittypat was crying into her pillows in her room for Ashley had told her goodby half an hour before No sounds of murmuring voices or of tears came from behind the closed door of Melanies bedroom It seemed to Scarlett that he had been in that room for hours and she resented bitterly each moment that he stayed saying goodby to his wife for the moments were slipping by so fast and his time was so short She thought of all the things she had intended to say to him during this week But there had been no opportunity to say them and she knew now that perhaps she would never have the chance to say them Such foolish little things some of them Ashley you will be careful wont you Please dont get your feet wet You take cold so easily Dont forget to put a newspaper across your chest under your shirt It keeps out the wind so well But there were other things more important things she had wanted to say much more important things she had wanted to hear him say things she had wanted to read in his eyes even if he did not speak them So many things to say and now there was no time Even the few minutes that remained might be snatched away from her if Melanie followed him to the door to the carriage block Why hadnt she made the opportunity during this last week But always Melanie was at his side her eyes caressing him adoringly always friends and neighbors and relatives were in the house and from morning till night Ashley was never alone Then at night the door of the bedroom closed and he was alone with Melanie Never once during these last days had he betrayed to Scarlett by one look one word anything but the affection a brother might show a sister or a friend a lifelong friend She could not let him go away perhaps forever without knowing whether he still loved her Then even if he died she could nurse the warm comfort of his secret love to the end of her days After what seemed an eternity of waiting she heard the sound of his boots in the bedroom above and the door opening and closing She heard him coming down the steps Alone Thank God for that Melanie must be too overcome by the grief of parting to leave her room Now she would have him for herself for a few precious minutes  Page    Gone With The Wind He came down the steps slowly his spurs clinking and she could hear the slapslap of his saber against his high boots When he came into the parlor his eyes were somber He was trying to smile but his face was as white and drawn as a man bleeding from an internal wound She rose as he entered thinking with proprietary pride that he was the handsomest soldier she had ever seen His long holster and belt glistened and his silver spurs and scabbard gleamed from the industrious polishing Uncle Peter had given them His new coat did not fit very well for the tailor had been hurried and some of the seams were awry The bright new sheen of the gray coat was sadly at variance with the worn and patched butternut trousers and the scarred boots but if he had been clothed in silver armor he could not have looked more the shining knight to her Ashley she begged abruptly may I go to the train with you Please dont Father and the girls will be there And anyway Id rather remember you saying goodby to me here than shivering at the depot Theres so much to memories Instantly she abandoned her plan If India and Honey who disliked her so much were to be present at the leave taking she would have no chance for a private word Then I wont go she said See Ashley Ive another present for you A little shy now that the time had come to give it to him she unrolled the package It was a long yellow sash made of thick China silk and edged with heavy fringe Rhett Butler had brought her a yellow shawl from Havana several months before a shawl gaudily embroidered with birds and flowers in magenta and blue During this last week she had patiently picked out all the embroidery and cut up the square of silk and stitched it into a sash length Scarlett its beautiful Did you make it yourself Then Ill value it all the more Put it on me my dear The boys will be green with envy when they see me in the glory of my new coat and sash She wrapped the bright lengths about his slender waist above his belt and tied the ends in a lovers knot Melanie might have given him his new coat but this sash was her gift her own secret guerdon for him to wear into battle something that would make him remember her every time he looked at it She stood back and viewed him with pride thinking that even Jeb Stuart with his flaunting sash and plume could not look so dashing as her cavalier Its beautiful he repeated fingering the fringe But I know youve cut up a dress or a shawl to make it You shouldnt have done it Scarlett Pretty things are too hard to get these days Oh Ashley Id She had started to say Id cut up my heart for you to wear if you wanted it but she finished Id do anything for you Would you he questioned and some of the somberness lifted from his face Then theres something you can do for me Scarlett something that will make my mind easier when Im away What is it she asked joyfully ready to promise prodigies Scarlett will you look after Melanie for me Look after Melly Her heart sank with bitter disappointment So this was something beautiful something spectacular And then anger flared This moment was her moment with Ashley hers alone And yet though Melanie was absent her pale shadow lay between them How could he bring up her name in their moment of farewell How could he ask such a thing of her He did not notice the disappointment on her face As of old his eyes were looking through her and beyond her at something else not seeing her at all Yes keep an eye on her take care of her Shes so frail and she doesnt realize it Shell wear herself out nursing and sewing And shes so gentle and timid Except for Aunt Pittypat and Uncle Henry and you she hasnt a close relative in the world except the Burrs in Macon and theyre third cousins And Aunt PittyScarlett you know shes like a child And Uncle Henry is an old man Melanie loves you so much not just because you were Charlies wife but becausewell because youre you and she loves you like a sister Scarlett I have nightmares when I think what might happen to her if I were killed and she had no one to turn to Will you promise She did not even hear his last request so terrified was she by those illomened words if I were killed Every day she had read the casualty lists read them with her heart in her throat knowing that the world would end if anything should happen to him But always always she had an inner feeling that even if the Confederate Army were entirely wiped out Ashley would be spared And now he had spoken the frightful words Goose bumps came out all over her and fear swamped her a superstitious fear she could not combat with reason She was Irish enough to believe in second sight especially where death premonitions were concerned and in his wide gray eyes she saw some deep sadness which she could only interpret as that of a man who has felt the cold finger on his shoulder has heard the wail of the Banshee You mustnt say it You mustnt even think it Its bad luck to speak of death Oh say a prayer quickly You say it for me and light some candles too he said smiling at the frightened urgency in her voice But she could not answer so stricken was she by the pictures her mind was drawing Ashley lying dead in the snows of Virginia so far away from her He went on speaking and there was a quality in his voice a sadness a resignation that increased her fear until every vestige of anger and disappointment was blotted out Im asking you for this reason Scarlett I cannot tell what will happen to me or what will happen to any of us But when the end comes I shall be far away from here even if I am alive too far away to look out for Melanie Thethe end The end of the warand the end of the world But Ashley surely you cant think the Yankees win beat us All this week youve talked about how strong General Lee All this week Ive talked lies like all men talk when theyre on furlough Why should I frighten Melanie and Aunt Pitty before theres any need for them to be frightened Yes Scarlett I think the Yankees have us Gettysburg was the beginning of the end The people back home dont know it yet They cant realize how things stand with us butScarlett some of my men are barefooted now and the snow is deep in Virginia And when I see their poor frozen feet wrapped in rags and old sacks and I see the blood prints they leave in the snow and know that Ive got a whole pair of bootswell I feel like I should give mine away  Page    Gone With The Wind and be barefooted too Oh Ashley promise me you wont give them away When I see things like that and then look at the Yankeesthen I see the end of everything Why Scarlett the Yankees are buying soldiers from Europe by the thousands Most of the prisoners weve taken recently cant even speak English Theyre Germans and Poles and wild Irishmen who talk Gaelic But when we lose a man he cant be replaced When our shoes wear out there are no more shoes Were bottled up Scarlett And we cant fight the whole world She thought wildly Let the whole Confederacy crumble in the dust Let the world end but you must not die I couldnt live if you were dead I hope you will not repeat what I have said Scarlett I do not want to alarm the others And my dear I would not have alarmed you by saying these things were it not that I had to explain why I ask you to look after Melanie Shes so frail and weak and youre so strong Scarlett It will be a comfort to me to know that you are together if anything happens to me You will promise wont you Oh yes she cried for at that moment seeing death at his elbow she would have promised anything Ashley Ashley I cant let you go away I simply cant be brave about it You must be brave he said and his voice changed subtly It was resonant deeper and his words fell swiftly as though hurried with some inner urgency You must be brave For how else can I stand it Her eyes sought his face quickly and with joy wondering if he meant that leaving her was breaking his heart even as it was breaking hers His face was as drawn as when he came down from bidding Melanie goodby but she could read nothing in his eyes He leaned down took her face in his hands and kissed her lightly on the forehead Scarlett Scarlett You are so fine and strong and good So beautiful not just your sweet face my dear but all of you your body and your mind and your soul Oh Ashley she whispered happily thrilling at his words and his touch on her face Nobody else but you ever I like to think that perhaps I know you better than most people and that I can see beautiful things buried deep in you that others are too careless and too hurried to notice He stopped speaking and his hands dropped from her face but his eyes still clung to her eyes She waited a moment breathless for him to continue atiptoe to hear him say the magic three words But they did not come She searched his face frantically her lips quivering for she saw he had finished speaking This second blighting of her hopes was more than heart could bear and she cried Oh in a childish whisper and sat down tears stinging her eyes Then she heard an ominous sound in the driveway outside the window a sound that brought home to her even more sharply the imminence of Ashleys departure A pagan hearing the lapping of the waters around Charons boat could not have felt more desolate Uncle Peter muffled in a quilt was bringing out the carriage to take Ashley to the train Ashley said Goodby very softly caught up from the table the wide felt hat she had inveigled from Rhett and walked into the dark front hall His hand on the doorknob he turned and looked at her a long desperate look as if he wanted to carry away with him every detail of her face and figure Through a blinding mist of tears she saw his face and with a strangling pain in her throat she knew that he was going away away from her care away from the safe haven of this house and out of her life perhaps forever without having spoken the words she so yearned to hear Time was going by like a mill race and now it was too late She ran stumbling across the parlor and into the hall and clutched the ends of his sash Kiss me she whispered Kiss me goodby His arms went around her gently and he bent his head to her face At the first touch of his lips on hers her arms were about his neck in a strangling grip For a fleeting immeasurable instant he pressed her body close to his Then she felt a sudden tensing of all his muscles Swiftly he dropped the hat to the floor and reaching up detached her arms from his neck No Scarlett no he said in a low voice holding her crossed wrists in a grip that hurt I love you she said choking Ive always loved you Ive never loved anybody else I just married Charlie to to try to hurt you Oh Ashley I love you so much Id walk every step of the way to Virginia just to be near you And Id cook for you and polish your boots and groom your horse Ashley say you love me Ill live on it for the rest of my life He bent suddenly to retrieve his hat and she had one glimpse of his face It was the unhappiest face she was ever to see a face from which all aloofness had fled Written on it were his love for and joy that she loved him but battling them both were shame and despair Goodby he said hoarsely The door clicked open and a gust of cold wind swept the house fluttering the curtains Scarlett shivered as she watched him run down the walk to the carriage his saber glinting in the feeble winter sunlight the fringe of his sash dancing jauntily CHAPTER XVI JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF  PASSED full of cold rains and wild winds clouded by pervasive gloom and depres sion In addition to the defeats at Gettysburg and Vicksburg the center of the Southern line had caved After hard fighting nearly all of Tennessee was now held by the Union troops But even with this loss on the top of the others the Souths spirit was not broken True grim determination had taken the place of highhearted hopes but people could still find a silver lining in the cloud For one thing the Yankees had been stoutly repulsed in September when they had tried to follow up their victories in Tennessee by an advance into Georgia Here in the northwesternmost corner of the state at Chickamauga serious fighting had occurred on Georgia soil for the first time since the war began The Yankees had taken Chattanooga and then had marched through the mountain passes into Georgia but they had been driven back with heavy losses Atlanta and its railroads had played a big part in making Chickamauga a great victory for the South Over the railroads that led down from Virginia to Atlanta and then northward to Tennessee General Longstreets corps had been rushed to the scene of the  Page    Gone With The Wind battle Along the entire route of several hundred miles the tracks had been cleared and all the available rolling stock in the Southeast had been assembled for the movement Atlanta had watched while train after train rolled through the town hour after hour passenger coaches box cars flat cars filled with shouting men They had come without food or sleep without their horses ambulances or supply trains and without waiting for the rest they had leaped from the trains and into the battle And the Yankees had been driven out of Georgia back into Tennessee It was the greatest feat of the war and Atlanta took pride and personal satisfaction in the thought that its railroads had made the victory possible But the South had needed the cheering news from Chickamauga to strengthen its morale through the winter No one denied now that the Yankees were good fighters and at last they had good generals Grant was a butcher who did not care how many men he slaughtered for a victory but victory he would have Sheridan was a name to bring dread to Southern hearts And then there was a man named Sherman who was being mentioned more and more often He had risen to prominence in the campaigns in Tennessee and the West and his reputation as a determined and ruthless fighter was growing None of them of course compared with General Lee Faith in the General and the army was still strong Confidence in ultimate victory never wavered But the war was dragging out so long There were so many dead so many wounded and maimed for life so many widowed so many orphaned And there was still a long struggle ahead which meant more dead more wounded more widows and orphans To make matters worse a vague distrust of those in high places had begun to creep over the civilian population Many newspapers were outspoken in their denunciation of President Davis himself and the manner in which he prosecuted the war There were dissensions within the Confederate cabinet disagreements between President Davis and his generals The currency was falling rapidly Shoes and clothing for the army were scarce ordnance supplies and drugs were scarcer The railroads needed new cars to take the place of old ones and new iron rails to replace those torn up by the Yankees The generals in the field were crying out for fresh troops and there were fewer and fewer fresh troops to be had Worst of all some of the state governors Governor Brown of Georgia among them were refusing to send state militia troops and arms out of their borders There were thousands of ablebodied men in the state troops for whom the army was frantic but the government pleaded for them in vain With the new fall of currency prices soared again Beef pork and butter cost thirtyfive dollars a pound flour fourteen hundred dollars a barrel soda one hundred dollars a pound tea five hundred dollars a pound Warm clothing when it was obtainable at all had risen to such prohibitive prices that Atlanta ladies were lining their old dresses with rags and reinforcing them with newspapers to keep out the wind Shoes cost from two hundred to eight hundred dollars a pair depending on whether they were made of cardboard or real leather Ladies now wore gaiters made of their old wool shawls and cutup carpets The soles were made of wood The truth was that the North was holding the South in a virtual state of siege though many did not realize it The Yankee gunboats had tightened the mesh at the ports and very few ships were now able to slip past the blockade The South had always lived by selling cotton and buying the things it did not produce but now it could neither sell nor buy Gerald OHara had three years crops of cotton stored under the shed near the gin house at Tara but little good it did him In Liverpool it would bring one hundred and fifty thousand dollars but there was no hope of getting it to Liverpool Gerald had changed from a wealthy man to a man who was wondering how he would feed his family and his negroes through the winter Throughout the South most of the cotton planters were in the same fix With the blockade closing tighter and tighter there was no way to get the Souths money crop to its market in England no way to bring in the necessaries which cotton money had brought in years gone by And the agricultural South waging war with the industrial North was needing so many things now things it had never thought of buying in times of peace It was a situation made to order for speculators and profiteers and men were not lacking to take advantage of it As food and clothing grew scarcer and prices rose higher and higher the public outcry against the speculators grew louder and more venomous In those early days of  no newspaper could be opened that did not carry scathing editorials denouncing the speculators as vultures and bloodsucking leeches and calling upon the government to put them down with a hard hand The government did its best but the efforts came to nothing for the government was harried by many things Against no one was feeling more bitter than against Rhett Butler He had sold his boats when blockading grew too hazardous and he was now openly engaged in food speculation The stories about him that came back to Atlanta from Richmond and Wilmington made those who had received him in other days writhe with shame In spite of all these trials and tribulations Atlantas ten thousand population had grown to double that number during the war Even the blockade had added to Atlantas prestige From time immemorial the coast cities had dominated the South commercially and otherwise But now with the ports closed and many of the port cities captured or besieged the Souths salvation depended upon itself The interior section was what counted if the South was going to win the war and Atlanta was now the center of things The people of the town were suffering hardship privation sickness and death as severely as the rest of the Confederacy but Atlanta the city had gained rather than lost as a result of the war Atlanta the heart of the Confederacy was still beating full and strong the railroads that were its arteries throbbing with the neverending flow of men munitions and supplies In other days Scarlett would have been bitter about her shabby dresses and patched shoes but now she did not care for the one person who mattered was not there to see her She was happy those two months happier than she had been in years Had she not felt the start of Ashleys heart when her arms went round his neck seen that despairing look on his face which was more open an avowal than any words could be He loved her She was sure of that now and this conviction was so pleasant she could even be kinder to Melanie She could be sorry for Melanie now sorry with a faint contempt for her blindness her stupidity When the war is over she thought When its overthen  Sometimes she thought with a small dart of fear What then But she put the thought from her mind When the war was over  Page    Gone With The Wind everything would be settled somehow If Ashley loved her he simply couldnt go on living with Melanie But then a divorce was unthinkable and Ellen and Gerald staunch Catholics that they were would never permit her to marry a divorced man It would mean leaving the Church Scarlett thought it over and decided that in a choice between the Church and Ashley she would choose Ashley But oh it would make such a scandal Divorced people were under the ban not only of the Church but of society No divorced person was received However she would dare even that for Ashley She would sacrifice anything for Ashley Somehow it would come out all right when the war was over If Ashley loved her so much hed find a way Shed make him find a way And with every day that passed she became more sure in her own mind of his devotion more certain he would arrange matters satisfactorily when the Yankees were finally beaten Of course he had said the Yankees had them Scarlett thought that was just foolishness He had been tired and upset when he said it But she hardly cared whether the Yankees won or not The thing that mattered was for the war to finish quickly and for Ashley to come home Then when the sleets of March were keeping everyone indoors the hideous blow fell Melanie her eyes shining with joy her head ducked with embarrassed pride told her she was going to have a baby Dr Meade says it will be here in late August or September she said Ive thoughtbut I wasnt sure till today Oh Scarlett isnt it wonderful Ive so envied you Wade and so wanted a baby And I was so afraid that maybe I wasnt ever going to have one and darling I want a dozen Scarlett had been combing her hair preparing for bed when Melanie spoke and she stopped the comb in midair Dear God she said and for a moment realization did not come Then there suddenly leaped to her mind the closed door of Melanies bedroom and a knifelike pain went through her a pain as fierce as though Ashley had been her own husband and had been unfaithful to her A baby Ashleys baby Oh how could he when he loved her and not Melanie I know youre surprised Melanie rattled on breathlessly And isnt it too wonderful Oh Scarlett I dont know how I shall ever write Ashley It wouldnt be so embarrassing if I could tell him ororwell not say anything and just let him notice gradually you know Dear God said Scarlett almost sobbing as she dropped the comb and caught at the marble top of the dresser for support Darling dont look like that You know having a baby isnt so bad You said so yourself And you mustnt worry about me though you are sweet to be so upset Of course Dr Meade said I waswas Melanie blushed quite narrow but that perhaps I shouldnt have any trouble and Scarlett did you write Charlie and tell him when you found out about Wade or did your mother do it or maybe Mr OHara Oh dear if I only had a mother to do it I just dont see how Hush said Scarlett violently Hush Oh Scarlett Im so stupid Im sorry I guess all happy people are selfish I forgot about Charlie just for the moment  Hush said Scarlett again fighting to control her face and make her emotions quiet Never never must Melanie see or suspect how she felt Melanie the most tactful of women had tears in her eyes at her own cruelty How could she have brought back to Scarlett the terrible memories of Wade being born months after poor Charlie was dead How could she have been so thoughtless Let me help you undress dearest she said humbly And Ill rub your head for you You leave me alone said Scarlett her face like stone And Melanie bursting into tears of selfcondemnation fled the room leaving Scarlett to a tearless bed with wounded pride disillusionment and jealousy for bedfellows She thought that she could not live any longer in the same house with the woman who was carrying Ashleys child thought that she would go home to Tara home where she belonged She did not see how she could ever look at Melanie again and not have her secret read in her face And she arose the next morning with the fixed intention of packing her trunk immediately after breakfast But as they sat at the table Scarlett silent and gloomy Pitty bewildered and Melanie miserable a telegram came It was to Melanie from Ashleys body servant Mose I have looked everywhere and I cant find him Must I come home No one knew what it meant but the eyes of the three women went to one another wide with terror and Scarlett forgot all thoughts of going home Without finishing their breakfasts they drove down to telegraph Ashleys colonel but even as they entered the office there was a telegram from him Regret to inform you Major Wilkes missing since scouting expedition three days ago Will keep you informed It was a ghastly trip home with Aunt Pitty crying into her handkerchief Melanie sitting erect and white and Scarlett slumped stunned in the corner of the carriage Once in the house Scarlett stumbled up the stairs to her bedroom and clutching her Rosary from the table dropped to her knees and tried to pray But the prayers would not come There only fell on her an abysmal fear a certain knowledge that God had turned His face from her for her sin She had loved a married man and tried to take him from his wife and God had punished her by killing him She wanted to pray but she could not raise her eyes to Heaven She wanted to cry but the tears would not come They seemed to flood her chest and they were hot tears that burned under her bosom but they would not flow Her door opened and Melanie entered Her face was like a heart cut from white paper framed against black hair and her eyes were wide like those of a frightened child lost in the dark Scarlett she said putting out her hands You must forgive me for what I said yesterday for youreall Ive got now Oh Scarlett I know my darling is dead Somehow she was in Scarletts arms her small breasts heaving with sobs and somehow they were lying on the bed holding each other close and Scarlett was crying too crying with her face pressed close against Melanies the tears of one wetting the cheeks of the other It hurt so terribly to cry but not so much as not being able to cry Ashley is deaddead she thought and I have killed him by loving him Fresh sobs broke from her and Melanie somehow feeling comfort in her tears tightened her arms about her neck At least she whispered at leastIve got his baby And I thought Scarlett too stricken now for anything so petty as jealousy Ive got nothingnothingnothing except the  Page    Gone With The Wind look on his face when he told me goodby The first reports were Missingbelieved killed and so they appeared on the casualty list Melanie telegraphed Colonel Sloan a dozen times and finally a letter arrived full of sympathy explaining that Ashley and a squad had ridden out on a scouting expedition and had not returned There had been reports of a slight skirmish within the Yankee lines and Mose frantic with grief had risked his own life to search for Ashleys body but had found nothing Melanie strangely calm now telegraphed him money and instructions to come home When Missingbelieved captured appeared on the casualty lists joy and hope reanimated the sad household Melanie could hardly be dragged away from the telegraph office and she met every train hoping for letters She was sick now her pregnancy making itself felt in many unpleasant ways but she refused to obey Dr Meades commands and stay in bed A feverish energy possessed her and would not let her be still and at night long after Scarlett had gone to bed she could hear her walking the floor in the next room One afternoon she came home from town driven by the frightened Uncle Peter and supported by Rhett Butler She had fainted at the telegraph office and Rhett passing by and observing the excitement had escorted her home He carried her up the stairs to her bedroom and while the alarmed household fled hither and you for hot bricks blankets and whisky he propped her on the pillows of her bed Mrs Wilkes he questioned abruptly you are going to have a baby are you not Had Melanie not been so faint so sick so heartsore she would have collapsed at his question Even with women friends she was embarrassed by any mention of her condition while visits to Dr Meade were agonizing experiences And for a man especially Rhett Butler to ask such a question was unthinkable But lying weak and forlorn in the bed she could only nod After she had nodded it did not seem so dreadful for he looked so kind and so concerned Then you must take better care of yourself All this running about and worry wont help you and may harm the baby If you will permit me Mrs Wilkes I will use what influence I have in Washington to learn about Mr Wilkes fate If he is a prisoner he will be on the Federal lists and if he isntwell theres nothing worse than uncertainty But I must have your promise Take care of yourself or before God I wont turn a hand Oh you are so kind cried Melanie How can people say such dreadful things about you Then overcome with the knowledge of her tactlessness and also with horror at having discussed her condition with a man she began to cry weakly And Scarlett flying up the stairs with a hot brick wrapped in flannel found Rhett patting her hand He was as good as his word They never knew what wires he pulled They feared to ask knowing it might involve an admission of his too close affiliations with the Yankees It was a month before he had news news that raised them to the heights when they first heard it but later created a gnawing anxiety In their hearts Ashley was not dead He had been wounded and taken prisoner and the records showed that he was at Rock Island a prison camp in Illinois In their first joy they could think of nothing except that he was alive But when calmness began to return they looked at one another and said Rock Island in the same voice they would have said In Hell For even as Andersonville was a name that stank in the North so was Rock Island one to bring terror to the heart of any Southerner who had relatives imprisoned there When Lincoln refused to exchange prisoners believing it would hasten the end of the war to burden the Confederacy with the feeding and guarding of Union prisoners there were thousands of bluecoats at Andersonville Georgia The Confederates were on scant rations and practically without drugs or bandages for their own sick and wounded They had little to share with the prisoners They fed their prisoners on what the soldiers in the field were eating fat pork and dried peas and on this diet the Yankees died like flies sometimes a hundred a day Inflamed by the reports the North resorted to harsher treatment of Confederate prisoners and at no place were conditions worse than at Rock Island Food was scanty one blanket for three men and the ravages of smallpox pneumonia and typhoid gave the place the name of a pesthouse Threefourths of all the men sent there never came out alive And Ashley was in that horrible place Ashley was alive but he was wounded and at Rock Island and the snow must have been deep in Illinois when he was taken there Had he died of his wound since Rhett had learned his news Had he fallen victim to smallpox Was he delirious with pneumonia and no blanket to cover him Oh Captain Butler isnt there some way Cant you use your influence and have him exchanged cried Melanie Mr Lincoln the merciful and just who cries large tears over Mrs Bixbys five boys hasnt any tears to shed about the thousands of Yankees dying at Andersonville said Rhett his mouth twisting He doesnt care if they all die The order is out No exchanges II hadnt told you before Mrs Wilkes but your husband had a chance to get out and refused it Oh no cried Melanie in disbelief Yes indeed The Yankees are recruiting men for frontier service to fight the Indians recruiting them from among Confederate prisoners Any prisoner who will take the oath of allegiance and enlist for Indian service for two years will be released and sent West Mr Wilkes refused Oh how could he cried Scarlett Why didnt he take the oath and then desert and come home as soon as he got out of jail Melanie turned on her like a small fury How can you even suggest that he would do such a thing Betray his own Confederacy by taking that vile oath and then betray his word to the Yankees I would rather know he was dead at Rock Island than hear he had taken that oath Id be proud of him if he died in prison But if he did that  I would never look on his face again Never Of course he refused When Scarlett was seeing Rhett to the door she asked indignantly If it were you wouldnt you enlist with the Yankees to keep from dying in that place and then desert Of course said Rhett his teeth showing beneath his mustache Then why didnt Ashley do it Hes a gentleman said Rhett and Scarlett wondered how it was possible to convey such cynicism and contempt in that one  Page    Gone With The Wind honorable word Part Three CHAPTER XVII MAY OF  CAMEa hot dry May that wilted the flowers in the budsand the Yankees under General Sherman were in Georgia again above Dalton one hundred miles northwest of Atlanta Rumor had it that there would be heavy fighting up there near the boundary between Georgia and Tennessee The Yankees were massing for an attack on the Western and Atlantic Railroad the line which connected Atlanta with Tennessee and the West the same line over which the Southern troops had been rushed last fall to win the victory at Chickamauga But for the most part Atlanta was not disturbed by the prospect of fighting near Dalton The place where the Yankees were concentrating was only a few miles southeast of the battle field of Chickamauga They had been driven back once when they had tried to break through the mountain passes of that region and they would be driven back again Atlantaand all of Georgiaknew that the state was far too important to the Confederacy for General Joe Johnston to let the Yankees remain inside the states borders for long Old Joe and his army would not let even one Yankee get south of Dalton for too much depended on the undisturbed functioning of Georgia The unravaged state was a vast granary machine shop and storehouse for the Confederacy It manufactured much of the powder and arms used by the army and most of the cotton and woolen goods Lying between Atlanta and Dalton was the city of Rome with its cannon foundry and its other industries and Etowah and Allatoona with the largest ironworks south of Richmond And in Atlanta were not only the factories for making pistols and saddles tents and ammunition but also the most extensive rolling mills in the South the shops of the principal railroads and the enormous hospitals And in Atlanta was the junction of the four railroads on which the very life of the Confederacy depended So no one worried particularly After all Dalton was a long way off up near the Tennessee line There had been fighting in Tennessee for three years and people were accustomed to the thought of that state as a faraway battle field almost as far away as Virginia or the Mississippi River Moreover Old Joe and his men were between the Yankees and Atlanta and everyone knew that next to General Lee himself there was no greater general than Johnston now that Stonewall Jackson was dead Dr Meade summed up the civilian point of view on the matter one warm May evening on the veranda of Aunt Pittys house when he said that Atlanta had nothing to fear for General Johnston was standing in the mountains like an iron rampart His audience heard him with varying emotions for all who sat there rocking quietly in the fading twilight watching the first fireflies of the season moving magically through the dusk had weighty matters on their minds Mrs Meade her hand upon Phils arm was hoping the doctor was right If the war came closer she knew that Phil would have to go He was sixteen now and in the Home Guard Fanny Elsing pale and hollow eyed since Gettysburg was trying to keep her mind from the torturing picture which had worn a groove in her tired mind these past several monthsLieutenant Dallas McLure dying in a jolting ox cart in the rain on the long terrible retreat into Maryland Captain Carey Ashburns useless arm was hurting him again and moreover he was depressed by the thought that his courtship of Scarlett was at a standstill That had been the situation ever since the news of Ashley Wilkes capture though the connection between the two events did not occur to him Scarlett and Melanie both were thinking of Ashley as they always did when urgent tasks or the necessity of carrying on a conversation did not divert them Scarlett was thinking bitterly sorrowfully He must be dead or else we would have heard Melanie stemming the tide of fear again and again through endless hours was telling herself He cant be dead Id know itId feel it if he were dead Rhett Butler lounged in the shadows his long legs in their elegant boots crossed negligently his dark face an unreadable blank In his arms Wade slept contentedly a cleanly picked wishbone in his small hand Scarlett always permitted Wade to sit up late when Rhett called because the shy child was fond of him and Rhett oddly enough seemed to be fond of Wade Generally Scarlett was annoyed by the childs presence but he always behaved nicely in Rhetts arms As for Aunt Pitty she was nervously trying to stifle a belch for the rooster they had had for supper was a tough old bird That morning Aunt Pitty had reached the regretful decision that she had better kill the patriarch before he died of old age and pining for his harem which had long since been eaten For days he had drooped about the empty chicken run too dispirited to crow After Uncle Peter had wrung his neck Aunt Pitty had been beset by conscience at the thought of enjoying him en famille when so many of her friends had not tasted chicken for weeks so she suggested company for dinner Melanie who was now in her fifth month had not been out in public or received guests for weeks and she was appalled at the idea But Aunt Pitty for once was firm It would be selfish to eat the rooster alone and if Melanie would only move her top hoop a little higher no one would notice anything and she was so flat in the bust anyway Oh but Auntie I dont want to see people when Ashley It isnt as if Ashley werehad passed away said Aunt Pitty her voice quavering for in her heart she was certain Ashley was dead Hes just as much alive as you are and it will do you good to have company And Im going to ask Fanny Elsing too Mrs Elsing begged me to try to do something to arouse her and make her see people Oh but Auntie its cruel to force her when poor Dallas has only been dead Now Melly I shall cry with vexation if you argue with me I guess Im your auntie and I know whats what And I want a party So Aunt Pitty had her party and at the last minute a guest she did not expect or desire arrived Just when the smell of roast rooster was filling the house Rhett Butler back from one of his mysterious trips knocked at the door with a large box of bonbons packed in paper lace under his arm and a mouthful of twoedged compliments for her There was nothing to do but invite him to stay although Aunt Pitty knew how the doctor and Mrs Meade felt about him and how bitter Fanny was against any man not in uniform Neither the Meades nor the Elsings would have spoken to him on the street but in a friends home they would of course have to be polite to him Besides he was now more firmly than ever under the protection of the fragile Melanie After he  Page    Gone With The Wind had intervened for her to get the news about Ashley she had announced publicly that her home was open to him as long as he lived and no matter what other people might say about him Aunt Pittys apprehensions quieted when she saw that Rhett was on his best behavior He devoted himself to Fanny with such sympathetic deference she even smiled at him and the meal went well It was a princely feast Carey Ashburn had brought a little tea which he had found in the tobacco pouch of a captured Yankee en route to Andersonville and everyone had a cup faintly flavored with tobacco There was a nibble of the tough old bird for each an adequate amount of dressing made of corn meal and seasoned with onions a bowl of dried peas and plenty of rice and gravy the latter somewhat watery for there was no flour with which to thicken it For dessert there was a sweet potato pie followed by Rhetts bonbons and when Rhett produced real Havana cigars for the gentlemen to enjoy over their glass of blackberry wine everyone agreed it was indeed a Lucullan banquet When the gentlemen joined the ladies on the front porch the talk turned to war Talk always turned to war now all conversations on any topic led from war or back to warsometimes sad often gay but always war War romances war weddings deaths in hospitals and on the field incidents of camp and battle and march gallantry cowardice humor sadness deprivation and hope Always always hope Hope firm unshaken despite the defeats of the summer before When Captain Ashburn announced he had applied for and been granted transfer from Atlanta to the army at Dalton the ladies kissed his stiffened arm with their eyes and covered their emotions of pride by declaring he couldnt go for then who would beau them about Young Carey looked confused and pleased at hearing such statements from settled matrons and spinsters like Mrs Meade and Melanie and Aunt Pitty and Fanny and tried to hope that Scarlett really meant it Why hell be back in no time said the doctor throwing an arm over Careys shoulder Therell be just one brief skirmish and the Yankees will skedaddle back into Tennessee And when they get there General Forrest will take care of them You ladies need have no alarm about the proximity of the Yankees for General Johnston and his army stands there in the mountains like an iron rampart Yes an iron rampart he repeated relishing his phrase Sherman will never pass Hell never dislodge Old Joe The ladies smiled approvingly for his lightest utterance was regarded as incontrovertible truth After all men understood these matters much better than women and if he said General Johnston was an iron rampart he must be one Only Rhett spoke He had been silent since supper and had sat in the twilight listening to the war talk with a downtwisted mouth holding the sleeping child against his shoulder I believe that rumor has it that Sherman has over one hundred thousand men now that his reinforcements have come up The doctor answered him shortly He had been under considerable strain ever since he first arrived and found that one of his fellow diners was this man whom he disliked so heartily Only the respect due Miss Pittypat and his presence under her roof as a guest had restrained him from showing his feelings more obviously Well sir the doctor barked in reply I believe Captain Ashburn said just a while ago that General Johnston had only about forty thousand counting the deserters who were encouraged to come back to the colors by the last victory Sir said Mrs Meade indignantly There are no deserters in the Confederate army I beg your pardon said Rhett with mock humility I meant those thousands on furlough who forgot to rejoin their regiments and those who have been over their wounds for six months but who remain at home going about their usual business or doing the spring plowing His eyes gleamed and Mrs Meade bit her lip in a huff Scarlett wanted to giggle at her discomfiture for Rhett had caught her fairly There were hundreds of men skulking in the swamps and the mountains defying the provost guard to drag them back to the army They were the ones who declared it was a rich mans war and a poor mans fight and they had had enough of it But outnumbering these by far were men who though carried on company rolls as deserters had no intention of deserting perma nently They were the ones who had waited three years in vain for furloughs and while they waited received illspelled letters from home We air hungry There wont be no crop this yearthere aint nobody to plow We air hungry The commissary took the shoats and we aint had no money from you in months We air livin on dried peas Always the rising chorus swelled We are hungry your wife your babies your parents When will it be over When will you come home We are hungry hungry When furloughs from the rapidly thinning army were denied these soldiers went home without them to plow their land and plant their crops repair their houses and build up their fences When regimental officers understanding the situation saw a hard fight ahead they wrote these men telling them to rejoin their companies and no questions would be asked Usually the men returned when they saw that hunger at home would be held at bay for a few months longer Plow furloughs were not looked upon in the same light as desertion in the face of the enemy but they weakened the army just the same Dr Meade hastily bridged over the uncomfortable pause his voice cold Captain Butler the numerical difference between our troops and those of the Yankees has never mattered One Confederate is worth a dozen Yankees The ladies nodded Everyone knew that That was true at the first of the war said Rhett Perhaps its still true provided the Confederate soldier has bullets for his gun and shoes on his feet and food in his stomach Eh Captain Ashburn His voice was still soft and filled with specious humility Carey Ashburn looked unhappy for it was obvious that he too disliked Rhett intensely He gladly would have sided with the doctor but he could not lie The reason he had applied for transfer to the front despite his useless arm was that he realized as the civilian population did not the seriousness of the situation There were many other men stumping on wooden pegs blind in one eye fingers blown away one arm gone who were quietly transferring from the commissariat hospital duties mail and railroad service back to their old fighting units They knew Old Joe needed every man He did not speak and Dr Meade thundered losing his temper Our men have fought without shoes before and without food and won victories And they will fight again and win I tell you General Johnston cannot be dislodged The mountain fastnesses have always been the refuge and the strong forts of invaded peoples from ancient times Think ofthink of Thermopylae  Page    Gone With The Wind Scarlett thought hard but Thermopylae meant nothing to her They died to the last man at Thermopylae didnt they Doctor Rhett asked and his lips twitched with suppressed laughter Are you being insulting young man Doctor I beg of you You misunderstood me I merely asked for information My memory of ancient history is poor If need be our army will die to the last man before they permit the Yankees to advance farther into Georgia snapped the doctor But it will not be They will drive them out of Georgia in one skirmish Aunt Pittypat rose hastily and asked Scarlett to favor them with a piano selection and a song She saw that the conversation was rapidly getting into deep and stormy water She had known very well there would be trouble if she invited Rhett to supper There was always trouble when he was present Just how he started it she never exactly understood Dear Dear What did Scarlett see in the man And how could dear Melly defend him As Scarlett went obediently into the parlor a silence fell on the porch a silence that pulsed with resentment toward Rhett How could anyone not believe with heart and soul in the invincibility of General Johnston and his men Believing was a sacred duty And those who were so traitorous as not to believe should at least have the decency to keep their mouths shut Scarlett struck a few chords and her voice floated out to them from the parlor sweetly sadly in the words of a popular song Into a ward of whitewashed walls Where the dead and dying lay Wounded with bayonets shells and balls Somebodys darling was borne one day Somebodys darling so young and so brave Wearing still on his pale sweet face Soon to be hid by the dust of the grave The lingering light of his boyhoods grace Matted and damp are the curls of gold mourned Scarletts faulty soprano and Fanny half rose and said in a faint strangled voice Sing something else The piano was suddenly silent as Scarlett was overtaken with surprise and embarrassment Then she hastily blundered into the opening bars of Jacket of Gray and stopped with a discord as she remembered how heartrending that selection was too The piano was silent again for she was utterly at a loss All the songs had to do with death and parting and sorrow Rhett rose swiftly deposited Wade in Fannys lap and went into the parlor Play My Old Kentucky Home  he suggested smoothly and Scarlett gratefully plunged into it Her voice was joined by Rhetts excellent bass and as they went into the second verse those on the porch breathed more easily though Heaven knew it was none too cheery a song either Just a few more days for to tote the weary load No matter twill never be light Just a few more days till we totter in the road Then my old Kentucky home good night  Dr Meades prediction was rightas far as it went Johnston did stand like an iron rampart in the mountains above Dalton one hundred miles away So firmly did he stand and so bitterly did he contest Shermans desire to pass down the valley toward Atlanta that finally the Yankees drew back and took counsel with themselves They could not break the gray lines by direct assault and so under cover of night they marched through the mountain passes in a semicircle hoping to come upon Johnstons rear and cut the railroad behind him at Resaca fifteen miles below Dalton With those precious twin lines of iron in danger the Confederates left their desperately defended rifle pits and under the starlight made a forced march to Resaca by the short direct road When the Yankees swarming out of the hills came upon them the Southern troops were waiting for them entrenched behind breastworks batteries planted bayonets gleaming even as they had been at Dalton When the wounded from Dalton brought in garbled accounts of Old Joes retreat to Resaca Atlanta was surprised and a little disturbed It was as though a small dark cloud had appeared in the northwest the first cloud of a summer storm What was the General thinking about letting the Yankees penetrate eighteen miles farther into Georgia The mountains were natural fortresses even as Dr Meade had said Why hadnt Old Joe held the Yankees there Johnston fought desperately at Resaca and repulsed the Yankees again but Sherman employing the same flanking movement swung his vast army in another semicircle crossed the Oostanaula River and again struck at the railroad in the Confederate rear Again the gray lines were summoned swiftly from their red ditches to defend the railroad and weary for sleep exhausted from marching and fighting and hungry always hungry they made another rapid march down the valley They reached the little town of Calhoun six miles below Resaca ahead of the Yankees entrenched and were again ready for the attack when the Yankees came up The attack came there was fierce skirmishing and the Yankees were beaten back Wearily the Confederates lay on their arms and prayed for respite and rest But there was no rest Sherman inexorably advanced step by step swinging his army about them in a wide curve forcing another retreat to defend the railroad at their back The Confederates marched in their sleep too tired to think for the most part But when they did think they trusted Old Joe They knew they were retreating but they knew they had not been beaten They just didnt have enough men to hold their entrenchments and defeat Shermans flanking movements too They could and did lick the Yankees every time the Yankees  Page    Gone With The Wind would stand and fight What would be the end of this retreat they did not know But Old Joe knew what he was doing and that was enough for them He had conducted the retreat in masterly fashion for they had lost few men and the Yankees killed and captured ran high They hadnt lost a single wagon and only four guns And they hadnt lost the railroad at their back either Sherman hadnt laid a finger on it for all his frontal attacks cavalry dashes and flank movements The railroad It was still theirs that slender iron line winding through the sunny valley toward Atlanta Men lay down to sleep where they could see the rails gleaming faintly in the starlight Men lay down to die and the last sight that met their puzzled eyes was the rails shining in the merciless sun heat shimmering along them As they fell back down the valley an army of refugees fell back before them Planters and Crackers rich and poor black and white women and children the old the dying the crippled the wounded the women far gone in pregnancy crowded the road to Atlanta on trains afoot on horseback in carriages and wagons piled high with trunks and household goods Five miles ahead of the retreating army went the refugees halting at Resaca at Calhoun at Kingston hoping at each stop to hear that the Yankees had been driven back so they could return to their homes But there was no retracing that sunny road The gray troops passed by empty mansions deserted farms lonely cabins with doors ajar Here and there some lone woman remained with a few frightened slaves and they came to the road to cheer the soldiers to bring buckets of well water for the thirsty men to bind up the wounds and bury the dead in their own family burying grounds But for the most part the sunny valley was abandoned and desolate and the untended crops stood in parching fields Flanked again at Calhoun Johnston fell back to Adairsville where there was sharp skirmishing then to Cassville then south of Cartersville And the enemy had now advanced fiftyfive miles from Dalton At New Hope Church fifteen miles farther along the hotly fought way the gray ranks dug in for a determined stand On came the blue lines relentlessly like a monster serpent coiling striking venomously drawing its injured lengths back but always striking again There was desperate fighting at New Hope Church eleven days of continuous fighting with every Yankee assault bloodily repulsed Then Johnston flanked again withdrew his thinning lines a few miles farther The Confederate dead and wounded at New Hope Church ran high The wounded flooded Atlanta in trainloads and the town was appalled Never even after the battle of Chickamauga had the town seen so many wounded The hospitals overflowed and wounded lay on the floors of empty stores and upon cotton bales in the warehouses Every hotel boarding house and private residence was crowded with sufferers Aunt Pitty had her share although she protested that it was most unbecoming to have strange men in the house when Melanie was in a delicate condition and when gruesome sights might bring on premature birth But Melanie reefed up her top hoop a little higher to hide her thickening figure and the wounded invaded the brick house There was endless cooking and lifting and turning and fanning endless hours of washing and rerolling bandages and picking lint and endless warm nights made sleepless by the babbling delirium of men in the next room Finally the choked town could take care of no more and the overflow of wounded was sent on to the hospitals at Macon and Augusta With this backwash of wounded bearing conflicting reports and the increase of frightened refugees crowding into the already crowded town Atlanta was in an uproar The small cloud on the horizon had blown up swiftly into a large sullen storm cloud and it was as though a faint chilling wind blew from it No one had lost faith in the invincibility of the troops but everyone the civilians at least had lost faith in the General New Hope Church was only thirtyfive miles from Atlanta The General had let the Yankees push him back sixtyfive miles in three weeks Why didnt he hold the Yankees instead of everlastingly retreating He was a fool and worse than a fool Graybeards in the Home Guard and members of the state militia safe in Atlanta insisted they could have managed the campaign better and drew maps on tablecloths to prove their contentions As his lines grew thinner and he was forced back farther the General called desperately on Governor Brown for these very men but the state troops felt reasonably safe After all the Governor had defied Jeff Davis demand for them Why should he accede to General Johnston Fight and fall back Fight and fall back For seventy miles and twentyfive days the Confederates had fought almost daily New Hope Church was behind the gray troops now a memory in a mad haze of like memories heat dust hunger weariness tramptramp on the red rutted roads slopslop through the red mud retreat entrench fightretreat entrench fight New Hope Church was a nightmare of another life and so was Big Shanty where they turned and fought the Yankees like demons But fight the Yankees till the fields were blue with dead there were always more Yankees fresh Yankees there was always that sinister southeast curving of the blue lines toward the Confederate rear toward the railroadand toward Atlanta From Big Shanty the weary sleepless lines retreated down the road to Kennesaw Mountain near the little town of Marietta and here they spread their lines in a tenmile curve On the steep sides of the mountain they dug their rifle pits and on the towering heights they planted their batteries Swearing sweating men hauled the heavy guns up the precipitous slopes for mules could not climb the hillsides Couriers and wounded coming into Atlanta gave reassuring reports to the frightened townspeople The heights of Kennesaw were impregnable So were Pine Mountain and Lost Mountain near by which were also fortified The Yankees couldnt dislodge Old Joes men and they could hardly flank them now for the batteries on the mountain tops commanded all the roads for miles Atlanta breathed more easily but But Kennesaw Mountain was only twentytwo miles away On the day when the first wounded from Kennesaw Mountain were coming in Mrs Merriwethers carriage was at Aunt Pittys house at the unheardof hour of seven in the morning and black Uncle Levi sent up word that Scarlett must dress immediately and come to the hospital Fanny Rising and the Bonnell girls roused early from slumber were yawning on the back seat and the Risings mammy sat grumpily on the box a basket of freshly laundered bandages on her lap Off Scarlett went unwillingly for she had danced till dawn the night before at the Home Guards party and her feet were tired She silently cursed the efficient and indefatigable Mrs Merriwether the wounded and the whole Southern Confederacy as Prissy buttoned her in her oldest and raggedest calico frock which she used for hospital work Gulping down the bitter brew of parched corn and dried sweet potatoes that passed for coffee she went out to join the girls She was sick of all this nursing This very day she would tell Mrs Merriwether that Ellen had written her to come home for a visit Much good this did her for that worthy matron her sleeves rolled up her stout figure swathed in a large apron gave her one  Page    Gone With The Wind sharp look and said Dont let me hear any more such foolishness Scarlett Hamilton Ill write your mother today and tell her how much we need you and Im sure shell understand and let you stay Now put on your apron and trot over to Dr Meade He needs someone to help with the dressings Oh God thought Scarlett drearily thats just the trouble Mother will make me stay here and I shall die if I have to smell these stinks any longer I wish I was an old lady so I could bully the young ones instead of getting bulliedand tell old cats like Mrs Merriwether to go to Halifax Yes she was sick of the hospital the foul smells the lice the aching unwashed bodies If there had ever been any novelty and romance about nursing that had worn off a year ago Besides these men wounded in the retreat were not so attractive as the earlier ones had been They didnt show the slightest interest in her and they had very little to say beyond Hows the fightin goin Whats Old Joe doin now Mighty clever fellow Old Joe She didnt think Old Joe a mighty clever fellow All he had done was let the Yankees penetrate eightyeight miles into Georgia No they were not an attractive lot Moreover many of them were dying dying swiftly silently having little strength left to combat the blood poisoning gangrene typhoid and pneumonia which had set in before they could reach Atlanta and a doctor The day was hot and the flies came in the open windows in swarms fat lazy flies that broke the spirits of the men as pain could not The tide of smells and pain rose and rose about her Perspiration soaked through her freshly starched dress as she followed Dr Meade about a basin in her hand Oh the nausea of standing by the doctor trying not to vomit when his bright knife cut into mortifying flesh And oh the horror of hearing the screams from the operating ward where amputations were going on And the sick helpless sense of pity at the sight of tense white faces of mangled men waiting for the doctor to get to them men whose ears were filled with screams men waiting for the dreadful words Im sorry my boy but that hand will have to come off Yes yes I know but look see those red streaks Itll have to come off Chloroform was so scarce now it was used only for the worst amputations and opium was a precious thing used only to ease the dying out of life not the living out of pain There was no quinine and no iodine at all Yes Scarlett was sick of it all and that morning she wished that she like Melanie had the excuse of pregnancy to offer That was about the only excuse that was socially acceptable for not nursing these days When noon came she put off her apron and sneaked away from the hospital while Mrs Merriwether was busy writing a letter for a gangling illiterate mountaineer Scarlett felt that she could stand it no longer It was an imposition on her and she knew that when the wounded came in on the noon train there would be enough work to keep her busy until nightfalland probably without anything to eat She went hastily up the two short blocks to Peachtree Street breathing the unfouled air in as deep gulps as her tightly laced corset would permit She was standing on the corner uncertain as to what she would do next ashamed to go home to Aunt Pittys but determined not to go back to the hospital when Rhett Butler drove by You look like the ragpickers child he observed his eyes taking in the mended lavender calico streaked with perspiration and splotched here and there with water which had slopped from the basin Scarlett was furious with embarrassment and indignation Why did he always notice womens clothing and why was he so rude as to remark upon her present untidiness I dont want to hear a word out of you You get out and help me in and drive me somewhere where nobody will see me I wont go back to the hospital if they hang me My goodness I didnt start this war and I dont see any reason why I should be worked to death and A traitor to Our Glorious Cause The pots calling the kettle black You help me in I dont care where you were going Youre going to take me riding now He swung himself out of the carriage to the ground and she suddenly thought how nice it was to see a man who was whole who was not minus eyes or limbs or white with pain or yellow with malaria and who looked well fed and healthy He was so well dressed too His coat and trousers were actually of the same material and they fitted him instead of hanging in folds or being almost too tight for movement And they were new not ragged with dirty bare flesh and hairy legs showing through He looked as if he had not a care in the world and that in itself was startling these days when other men wore such worried preoccupied grim looks His brown face was Bland and his mouth red lipped clear cut as a womans frankly sensual smiled carelessly as he lifted her into the carriage The muscles of his big body rippled against his welltailored clothes as he got in beside her and as always the sense of his great physical power struck her like a blow She watched the swell of his powerful shoulders against the cloth with a fascination that was disturbing a little frightening His body seemed so tough and hard as tough and hard as his keen mind His was such an easy graceful strength lazy as a panther stretching in the sun alert as a panther to spring and strike You little fraud he said clucking to the horse You dance all night with the soldiers and give them roses and ribbons and tell them how youd die for the Cause and when it comes to bandaging a few wounds and picking off a few lice you decamp hastily Cant you talk about something else and drive faster It would be just my luck for Grandpa Merriwether to come out of his store and see me and tell old ladyI mean Mrs Merriwether He touched up the mare with the whip and she trotted briskly across Five Points and across the railroad tracks that cut the town in two The train bearing the wounded had already come in and the litter bearers were working swiftly in the hot sun transferring wounded into ambulances and covered ordnance wagons Scarlett had no qualm of conscience as she watched them but only a feeling of vast relief that she had made her escape Im just sick and tired of that old hospital she said settling her billowing skirts and tying her bonnet bow more firmly under her chin And every day more and more wounded come in Its all General Johnstons fault If hed just stood up to the Yankees at Dalton theyd have But he did stand up to the Yankees you ignorant child And if hed kept on standing there Sherman would have flanked him and crushed him between the two wings of his army And hed have lost the railroad and the railroad is what Johnston is fighting  Page    Gone With The Wind for Oh well said Scarlett on whom military strategy was utterly lost Its his fault anyway He ought to have done something about it and I think he ought to be removed Why doesnt he stand and fight instead of retreating You are like everyone else screaming Off with his head because he cant do the impossible He was Jesus the Savior at Dalton and now hes Judas the Betrayer at Kennesaw Mountain all in six weeks Yet just let him drive the Yankees back twenty miles and hell be Jesus again My child Sherman has twice as many men as Johnston and he can afford to lose two men for every one of our gallant laddies And Johnston cant afford to lose a single man He needs reinforcements badly and what is he getting Joe Browns Pets What a help theyll be Is the militia really going to be called out The Home Guard too I hadnt heard How do you know Theres a rumor floating about to that effect The rumor arrived on the train from Milledgeville this morning Both the militia and the Home Guards are going to be sent in to reinforce General Johnston Yes Governor Browns darlings are likely to smell powder at last and I imagine most of them will be much surprised Certainly they never expected to see action The Governor as good as promised them they wouldnt Well thats a good joke on them They thought they had bomb proofs because the Governor stood up to even Jeff Davis and refused to send them to Virginia Said they were needed for the defense of their state Whod have ever thought the war would come to their own back yard and theyd really have to defend their state Oh how can you laugh you cruel thing Think of the old gentlemen and the little boys in the Home Guard Why little Phil Meade will have to go and Grandpa Merriwether and Uncle Henry Hamilton Im not talking about the little boys and the Mexican War veterans Im talking about brave young men like Willie Guinan who like to wear pretty uniforms and wave swords And yourself My dear that didnt hurt a bit I wear no uniform and wave no sword and the fortunes of the Confederacy mean nothing at all to me Moreover I wouldnt be caught dead in the Home Guard or in any army for that matter I had enough of things military at West Point to do me the rest of my life  Well I wish Old Joe luck General Lee cant send him any help because the Yankees are keeping him busy in Virginia So the Georgia state troops are the only reinforcements Johnston can get He deserves better for hes a great strategist He always manages to get places before the Yankees do But hell have to keep falling back if he wants to protect the railroad and mark my words when they push him out of the mountains and onto the flatter land around here hes going to be butchered Around here cried Scarlett You know mighty well the Yankees will never get this far Kennesaw is only twentytwo miles away and Ill wager you Rhett look down the street That crowd of men They arent soldiers What on earth  Why theyre darkies There was a great cloud of red dust coming up the street and from the cloud came the sound of the tramping of many feet and a hundred or more negro voices deep throated careless singing a hymn Rhett pulled the carriage over to the curb and Scarlett looked curiously at the sweating black men picks and shovels over their shoulders shepherded along by an officer and a squad of men wearing the insignia of the engineering corps What on earth   she began again Then her eyes lighted on a singing black buck in the front rank He stood nearly six and a half feet tall a giant of a man ebony black stepping along with the lithe grace of a powerful animal his white teeth flashing as he led the gang in Go Down Moses Surely there wasnt a negro on earth as tall and loud voiced as this one except Big Sam the foreman of Tara But what was Big Sam doing here so far away from home especially now that there was no overseer on the plantation and he was Geralds righthand man As she half rose from her seat to look closer the giant caught sight of her and his black face split in a grin of delighted recognition He halted dropped his shovel and started toward her calling to the negroes nearest him Gawdlmighty Its Miss Scarlett You Lige Postle Prophet Dars Miss Scarlett There was confusion in the ranks The crowd halted uncertainly grinning and Big Sam followed by three other large negroes ran across the road to the carriage closely followed by the harried shouting officer Get back in line you fellows Get back I tell you or Ill Why its Mrs Hamilton Good morning Mam and you too sir What are you up to inciting mutiny and insubordination God knows Ive had trouble enough with these boys this morning Oh Captain Randall dont scold them They are our people This is Big Sam our foreman and Elijah and Apostle and Prophet from Tara Of course they had to speak to me How are you boys She shook hands all around her small white hand disappearing into their huge black paws and the four capered with delight at the meeting and with pride at displaying before their comrades what a pretty Young Miss they had What are you boys doing so far from Tara Youve run away Ill be bound Dont you know the patterollers will get you sure They bellowed pleasedly at the badinage Runned away answered Big Sam Nom us ain runned away Dey done sont an tuck us kase us wuz de fo bigges an stronges hans at Tara His white teeth showed proudly Dey specially sont fer me kase Ah could sing so good Yasm Mist Frank Kennedy he come by an tuck us But why Big Sam Lawd Miss Scarlett Ain you heerd Us is ter dig de ditches fer de wite gempmums ter hide in wen de Yankees comes Captain Randall and the occupants of the carriage smothered smiles at this naive explanation of rifle pits Cose Mis Gerald might nigh had a fit wen dey tuck me an he say he kain run de place widout me But Miss Ellen she say Tek him Mist Kennedy De Confedrutsy need Big Sam mo dan us do An she gib me a dollar an tell me ter do jes whut de wite gempmums tell me So hyah us is What does it all mean Captain Randall Oh its quite simple We have to strengthen the fortifications of Atlanta with more miles of rifle pits and the General cant  Page    Gone With The Wind spare any men from the front to do it So weve been impressing the strongest bucks in the countryside for the work But A cold little fear was beginning to throb in Scarletts breast More miles of rifle pits Why should they need more Within the last year a series of huge earth redoubts with battery emplacements had been built all around Atlanta one mile from the center of town These great earthworks were connected with rifle pits and they ran mile after mile completely encircling the city More rifle pits Butwhy should we be fortified any more than we are already fortified We wont need what weve got Surely the General wont let Our present fortifications are only a mile from town said Captain Randall shortly And thats too close for comfortor safety These new ones are going to be farther away You see another retreat may bring our men into Atlanta Immediately he regretted his last remark as her eyes widened with fear But of course there wont be another retreat he added hastily The lines around Kennesaw Mountain are impregnable The batteries are planted all up the mountain sides and they command the roads and the Yankees cant possibly get by But Scarlett saw him drop his eyes before the lazy penetrating look Rhett gave him and she was frightened She remembered Rhetts remark When the Yankees push him out of the mountains and onto the flatter land hell be butchered Oh Captain do you think Why of course not Dont fret your mind one minute Old Joe just believes in taking precautions Thats the only reason were digging more entrenchments  But I must be going now Its been pleasant talking to you  Say goodby to your mistress boys and lets get going Goodby boys Now if you get sick or hurt or in trouble let me know I live right down Peachtree Street down there in almost the last house at the end of town Wait a minute She fumbled in her reticule Oh dear I havent a cent Rhett give me a few shinplasters Here Big Sam buy some tobacco for yourself and the boys And be good and do what Captain Randall tells you The straggling line reformed the dust arose again in a red cloud as they moved off and Big Sam started up the singing again Go doow Moses Waaaay doown in Eeejup laaan An teel Ole Faaroo Ter let mahpeeepul go Rhett Captain Randall was lying to me just like all the men dotrying to keep the truth from us women for fear well faint Or was he lying Oh Rhett if theres no danger why are they digging these new breastworks Is the army so short of men theyve got to use darkies Rhett clucked to the mare The army is damned short of men Why else would the Home Guard be called out And as for the entrenchments well fortifications are supposed to be of some value in case of a siege The General is preparing to make his final stand here A siege Oh turn the horse around Im going home back home to Tara right away What ails you A siege Name of God a siege Ive heard about sieges Pa was in one or maybe it was his Pa and Pa told me What siege The siege at Drogheda when Cromwell had the Irish and they didnt have anything to eat and Pa said they starved and died in the streets and finally they ate all the cats and rats and even things like cockroaches And he said they ate each other too before they surrendered though I never did know whether to believe that or not And when Cromwell took the town all the women were A siege Mother of God You are the most barbarously ignorant young person I ever saw Drogheda was in sixteen hundred and something and Mr OHara couldnt possibly have been alive then Besides Sherman isnt Cromwell No but hes worse They say And as for the exotic viands the Irish ate at the siegepersonally Id as soon eat a nice juicy rat as some of the victuals theyve been serving me recently at the hotel I think I shall have to go back to Richmond They have good food there if you have the money to pay for it His eyes mocked the fear in her face Annoyed that she had shown her trepidation she cried I dont see why youve stayed here this long All you think about is being comfortable and eating andand things like that I know no more pleasant way to pass the time than in eating and erthings like that he said And as for why I stay herewell Ive read a good deal about sieges beleaguered cities and the like but Ive never seen one So I think Ill stay here and watch I wont get hurt because Im a noncombatant and besides I want the experience Never pass up new experiences Scarlett They enrich the mind My minds rich enough Perhaps you know best about that but I should say But that would be ungallant And perhaps Im staying here to rescue you when the siege does come Ive never rescued a maiden in distress That would be a new experience too She knew he was teasing her but she sensed a seriousness behind his words She tossed her head I wont need you to rescue me I can take care of myself thank you Dont say that Scarlett Think of it if you like but never never say it to a man Thats the trouble with Yankee girls Theyd be most charming if they werent always telling you that they can take care of themselves thank you Generally they are telling the truth God help them And so men let them take care of themselves How you do run on she said coldly for there was no insult worse than being likened to a Yankee girl I believe youre lying about a siege You know the Yankees will never get to Atlanta  Page    Gone With The Wind Ill bet you they will be here within the month Ill bet you a box of bonbons against His dark eyes wandered to her lips Against a kiss For a last brief moment fear of a Yankee invasion clutched her heart but at the word kiss she forgot about it This was familiar ground and far more interesting than military operations With difficulty she restrained a smile of glee Since the day when he gave her the green bonnet Rhett had made no advances which could in any way be construed as those of a lover He could never be inveigled into personal conversations try though she might but now with no angling on her part he was talking about kissing I dont care for such personal conversation she said coolly and managed a frown Besides Id just as soon kiss a pig Theres no accounting for tastes and Ive always heard the Irish were partial to pigskept them under their beds in fact But Scarlett you need kissing badly Thats whats wrong with you All your beaux have respected you too much though God knows why or they have been too afraid of you to really do right by you The result is that you are unendurably uppity You should be kissed and by someone who knows how The conversation was not going the way she wanted it It never did when she was with him Always it was a duel in which she was worsted And I suppose you think you are the proper person she asked with sarcasm holding her temper in check with difficulty Oh yes if I cared to take the trouble he said carelessly They say I kiss very well Oh she began indignant at the slight to her charms Why you  But her eyes fell in sudden confusion He was smiling but in the dark depths of his eyes a tiny light flickered for a brief moment like a small raw flame Of course youve probably wondered why I never tried to follow up that chaste peck I gave you the day I brought you that bonnet I have never Then you arent a nice girl Scarlett and Im sorry to hear it All really nice girls wonder when men dont try to kiss them They know they shouldnt want them to and they know they must act insulted if they do but just the same they wish the men would try  Well my dear take heart Some day I will kiss you and you will like it But not now so I beg you not to be too impatient She knew he was teasing but as always his teasing maddened her There was always too much truth in the things he said Well this finished him If ever ever he should be so ill bred as to try to take any liberties with her she would show him Will you kindly turn the horse around Captain Butler I wish to go back to the hospital Do you indeed my ministering angel Then lice and slops are preferable to my conversation Well far be it from me to keep a pair of willing hands from laboring for Our Glorious Cause He turned the horses head and they started back toward Five Points As to why I have made no further advances he pursued blandly as though she had not signified that the conversation was at an end Im waiting for you to grow up a little more You see it wouldnt be much fun for me to kiss you now and Im quite selfish about my pleasures I never fancied kissing children He smothered a grin as from the corner of his eye he saw her bosom heave with silent wrath And then too he continued softly I was waiting for the memory of the estimable Ashley Wilkes to fade At the mention of Ashleys name sudden pain went through her sudden hot tears stung her lids Fade The memory of Ashley would never fade not if he were dead a thousand years She thought of Ashley wounded dying in a faroff Yankee prison with no blankets over him with no one who loved him to hold his hand and she was filled with hate for the wellfed man who sat beside her jeers just beneath the surface of his drawling voice She was too angry to speak and they rode along in silence for some while I understand practically everything about you and Ashley now Rhett resumed I began with your inelegant scene at Twelve Oaks and since then Ive picked up many things by keeping my eyes open What things Oh that you still cherish a romantic schoolgirl passion for him which he reciprocates as well as his honorable nature will permit him And that Mrs Wilkes knows nothing and that between the two of you youve done her a pretty trick I understand practically everything except one thing that piques my curiosity Did the honorable Ashley ever jeopardize his immortal soul by kissing you A stony silence and an averted head were his answers Ah well so he did kiss you I suppose it was when he was here on furlough And now that hes probably dead you are cherishing it to your heart But Im sure youll get over it and when youve forgotten his kiss Ill She turned in fury You go toHalifax she said tensely her green eyes slits of rage And let me out of this carriage before I jump over the wheels And I dont ever want to speak to you again He stopped the carriage but before he could alight and assist her she sprang down Her hoop caught on the wheel and for a moment the crowd at Five Points had a flashing view of petticoats and pantalets Then Rhett leaned over and swiftly released it She flounced off without a word without even a backward look and he laughed softly and clicked to the horse CHAPTER XVIII FOR THE FIRST TIME since the war began Atlanta could hear the sound of battle In the early morning hours before the noises of the town awoke the cannon at Kennesaw Mountain could be heard faintly far away a low dim booming that might have passed for summer thunder Occasionally it was loud enough to be heard even above the rattle of traffic at noon People tried not to listen to it tried to talk to laugh to carry on their business just as though the Yankees were not there twentytwo miles away but always ears were strained for the sound The town wore a preoccupied look for no matter what occupied their hands all were listening listening their hearts leaping suddenly a hundred times a day Was the booming louder Or did they only think it was louder Would General Johnston hold them this time Would he  Page    Gone With The Wind Panic lay just beneath the surface Nerves which had been stretched tighter and tighter each day of the retreat began to reach the breaking point No one spoke of fears That subject was taboo but strained nerves found expression in loud criticism of the General Public feeling was at fever heat Sherman was at the very doors of Atlanta Another retreat might bring the Confederates into the town Give us a general who wont retreat Give us a man who will stand and fight With the faroff rumbling of cannon in their ears the state militia Joe Browns Pets and the Home Guard marched out of Atlanta to defend the bridges and ferries of the Chattahoochee River at Johnstons back It was a gray overcast day and as they marched through Five Points and out the Marietta road a fine rain began to fall The whole town had turned out to see them off and they stood close packed under the wooden awnings of the stores on Peachtree Street and tried to cheer Scarlett and Maybelle Merriwether Picard had been given permission to leave the hospital and watch the men go out because Uncle Henry Hamilton and Grandpa Merriwether were in the Home Guard and they stood with Mrs Meade pressed in the crowd tiptoeing to get a better view Scarlett though filled with the universal Southern desire to believe only the pleasantest and most reassuring things about the progress of the fighting felt cold as she watched the motley ranks go by Surely things must be in a desperate pass if this rabble of bombproofers old men and little boys were being called out To be sure there were young and ablebodied men in the passing lines tricked out in the bright uniforms of socially select militia units plumes waving sashes dancing But there were so many old men and young boys and the sight of them made her heart contract with pity and with fear There were graybeards older than her father trying to step jauntily along in the needlefine rain to the rhythm of the fife and dram corps Grandpa Merriwether with Mrs Merriwethers best plaid shawl laid across his shoulders to keep out the rain was in the first rank and he saluted the girls with a grin They waved their handkerchiefs and cried gay goodbys to him but Maybelle gripping Scarletts arm whispered Oh the poor old darling A real good rainstorm will just about finish him His lumbago Uncle Henry Hamilton marched in the rank behind Grandpa Merriwether the collar of his long black coat turned up about his ears two Mexican War pistols in his belt and a small carpetbag in his hand Beside him marched his black valet who was nearly as old as Uncle Henry with an open umbrella held over them both Shoulder to shoulder with their elders came the young boys none of them looking over sixteen Many of them had run away from school to join the army and here and there were clumps of them in the cadet uniforms of military academies the black cock feathers on their tight gray caps wet with rain the clean white canvas straps crossing their chests sodden Phil Meade was among them proudly wearing his dead brothers saber and horse pistols his hat bravely pinned up on one side Mrs Meade managed to smile and wave until he had passed and then she leaned her head on the back of Scarletts shoulder for a moment as though her strength had suddenly left her Many of the men were totally unarmed for the Confederacy had neither rifles nor ammunition to issue to them These men hoped to equip themselves from killed and captured Yankees Many carried bowie knives in their boots and bore in their hands long thick poles with ironpointed tips known as Joe Brown pikes The lucky ones had old flintlock muskets slung over their shoulders and powderhorns at their belts Johnston had lost around ten thousand men in his retreat He needed ten thousand more fresh troops And this thought Scarlett frightened is what he is getting As the artillery rumbled by splashing mud into the watching crowds a negro on a mule riding close to a cannon caught her eye He was a young saddlecolored negro with a serious face and when Scarlett saw him she cried Its Mose Ashleys Mose Whatever is he doing here She fought her way through the crowd to the curb and called Mose Stop The boy seeing her drew rein smiled delightedly and started to dismount A soaking sergeant riding behind him called Stay on that mule boy or Ill light a fire under you We got to git to the mountain some time Uncertainly Mose looked from the sergeant to Scarlett and she splashing through the mud close to the passing wheels caught at Moses stirrup strap Oh just a minute Sergeant Dont get down Mose What on earth are you doing here Ahs off ter de war agin Miss Scarlett Dis time wid Ole Mist John stead ob Mist Ashley Mr Wilkes Scarlett was stunned Mr Wilkes was nearly seventy Where is he Back wid de las cannon Miss Scarlett Back dar Sorry lady Move on boy Scarlett stood for a moment ankle deep in mud as the guns lurched by Oh no She thought It cant be Hes too old And he doesnt like war any more than Ashley did She retreated back a few paces toward the curb and scanned each face that passed Then as the last cannon and limber chest came groaning and splashing up she saw him slender erect his long silver hair wet upon his neck riding easily upon a little strawberry mare that picked her way as daintily through the mud holes as a lady in a satin dress Whythat mare was Nellie Mrs Tarletons Nellie Beatrice Tarletons treasured darling When he saw her standing in the mud Mr Wilkes drew rein with a smile of pleasure and dismounting came toward her I had hoped to see you Scarlett I was charged with so many messages from your people But there was no time We just got in this morning and they are rushing us out immediately as you see Oh Mr Wilkes she cried desperately holding his hand Dont go Why must you go Ah so you think Im too old he smiled and it was Ashleys smile in an older face Perhaps I am too old to march but not to ride and shoot And Mrs Tarleton so kindly lent me Nellie so I am well mounted I hope nothing happens to Nellie for if something should happen to her I could never go home and face Mrs Tarleton Nellie was the last horse she had left He was laughing now turning away her fears Your mother and father and the girls are well and they sent you their love Your father nearly came up with us today Oh not Pa cried Scarlett in terror Not Pa He isnt going to the war is he No but he was Of course he cant walk far with his stiff knee but he was all for riding away with us Your mother agreed providing he was able to jump the pasture fence for she said there would be a lot of rough riding to be done in the army Your father thought that easy butwould you believe it When his horse came to the fence he stopped dead and over his head went your father Its a wonder it didnt break his neck You know how obstinate he is He got right up and tried it again Well Scarlett  Page    Gone With The Wind he came off three times before Mrs OHara and Pork assisted him to bed He was in a taking about it swearing that your mother had spoken a wee word in the beasts ear He just isnt up to active service Scarlett You need have no shame about it After all someone must stay home and raise crops for the army Scarlett had no shame at all only an active feeling of relief Ive sent India and Honey to Macon to stay with the Burrs and Mr OHara is looking after Twelve Oaks as well as Tara  I must go my dear Let me kiss your pretty face Scarlett turned up her lips and there was a choking pain in her throat She was so fond of Mr Wilkes Once long ago she had hoped to be his daughterinlaw And you must deliver this kiss to Pittypat and this to Melanie he said kissing her lightly two more times And how is Melanie She is well Ah His eyes looked at her but through her past her as Ashleys had done remote gray eyes looking on another world I should have liked to see my first grandchild Goodby my dear He swung onto Nellie and cantered off his hat in his hand his silver hair bare to the rain Scarlett had rejoined Maybelle and Mrs Meade before the import of his last words broke upon her Then in superstitious terror she crossed herself and tried to say a prayer He had spoken of death just as Ashley had done and now Ashley No one should ever speak of death It was tempting Providence to mention death As the three women started silently back to the hospital in the rain Scarlett was praying Not him too God Not him and Ashley too The retreat from Dalton to Kennesaw Mountain had taken from early May to midJune and as the hot rainy days of June passed and Sherman failed to dislodge the Confederates from the steep slippery slopes hope again raised its head Everyone grew more cheerful and spoke more kindly of General Johnston As wet June days passed into a wetter July and the Confederates fighting desperately around the entrenched heights still held Sherman at bay a wild gaiety took hold of Atlanta Hope went to their heads like champagne Hurrah Hurrah Were holding them An epidemic of parties and dances broke out Whenever groups of men from the fighting were in town for the night dinners were given for them and afterwards there was dancing and the girls outnumbering the men ten to one made much of them and fought to dance with them Atlanta was crowded with visitors refugees families of wounded men in the hospitals wives and mothers of soldiers fighting at the mountain who wished to be near them in case of wounds In addition bevies of belles from the country districts where all remaining men were under sixteen or over sixty descended upon the town Aunt Pitty disapproved highly of these last for she felt they had come to Atlanta for no reason at all except to catch husbands and the shamelessness of it made her wonder what the world was coming to Scarlett disapproved too She did not care for the eager competition furnished by the sixteenyearolds whose fresh cheeks and bright smiles made one forget their twiceturned frocks and patched shoes Her own clothes were prettier and newer than most thanks to the material Rhett Butler had brought her on the last boat he ran in but after all she was nineteen and getting along and men had a way of chasing silly young things A widow with a child was at a disadvantage with these pretty minxes she thought But in these exciting days her widowhood and her motherhood weighed less heavily upon her than ever before Between hospital duties in the day time and parties at night she hardly ever saw Wade Sometimes she actually forgot for long stretches that she had a child In the warm wet summer nights Atlantas homes stood open to the soldiers the towns defenders The big houses from Washington Street to Peachtree Street blazed with lights as the muddy fighters in from the rifle pits were entertained and the sound of banjo and fiddle and the scrape of dancing feet and light laughter carried far on the night air Groups hung over pianos and voices sang lustily the sad words of Your Letter Came but Came Too Late while ragged gallants looked meaningly at girls who laughed from behind turkeytail fans begging them not to wait until it was too late None of the girls waited if they could help it With the tide of hysterical gaiety and excitement flooding the city they rushed into matrimony There were so many marriages that month while Johnston was holding the enemy at Kennesaw Mountain marriages with the bride turned out in blushing happiness and the hastily borrowed finery of a dozen friends and the groom with saber banging at patched knees So much excitement so many parties so many thrills Hurrah Johnston is holding the Yanks twentytwo miles away Yes the lines around Kennesaw Mountain were impregnable After twentyfive days of fighting even General Sherman was convinced of this for his losses were enormous Instead of continuing the direct assault he swung his army in a wide circle again and tried to come between the Confederates and Atlanta Again the strategy worked Johnston was forced to abandon the heights he had held so well in order to protect his rear He had lost a third of his men in that fight and the remainder slogged tiredly through the rain across the country toward the Chattahoochee River The Confederates could expect no more reinforcements whereas the railroad which the Yankees now held from Tennessee south to the battle line brought Sherman fresh troops and supplies daily So the gray lines went back through the muddy fields back toward Atlanta With the loss of the supposedly unconquerable position a fresh wave of terror swept the town For twentyfive wild happy days everyone had assured everyone else that this could not possibly happen And now it had happened But surely the General would hold the Yankees on the opposite bank of the river Though God knows the river was close enough only seven miles away But Sherman flanked them again crossing the stream above them and the weary gray files were forced to hurry across the yellow water and throw themselves again between the invaders and Atlanta They dug in hastily in shallow pits to the north of the town in the valley of Peachtree Creek Atlanta was in agony and panic Fight and fall back Fight and fall back And every retreat was bringing the Yankees closer to the town Peachtree Creek was only five miles away What was the General thinking about The cries of Give us a man who will stand and fight penetrated even to Richmond Richmond knew that if Atlanta was lost the war was lost and after the army had crossed the Chattahoochee General Johnston was removed from command General Hood one of his corps commanders took over the army and the town breathed a little easier Hood wouldnt retreat Not that tall  Page    Gone With The Wind Kentuckian with his flowing beard and flashing eye He had the reputation of a bulldog Hed drive the Yankees back from the creek yes back across the river and on up the road every step of the way back to Dalton But the army cried Give us back Old Joe for they had been with Old Joe all the weary miles from Dalton and they knew as the civilians could not know the odds that had opposed them Sherman did not wait for Hood to get himself in readiness to attack On the day after the change in command the Yankee general struck swiftly at the little town of Decatur six miles beyond Atlanta captured it and cut the railroad there This was the railroad connecting Atlanta with Augusta with Charleston and Wilmington and with Virginia Sherman had dealt the Confederacy a crippling blow The time had come for action Atlanta screamed for action Then on a July afternoon of steaming heat Atlanta had its wish General Hood did more than stand and fight He assaulted the Yankees fiercely at Peachtree Creek hurling his men from their rifle pits against the blue lines where Shermans men outnumbered him more than two to one Frightened praying that Hoods attack would drive the Yankees back everyone listened to the sound of booming cannon and the crackling of thousands of rifles which though five miles away from the center of town were so loud as to seem almost in the next block They could hear the rumblings of the batteries see the smoke which rolled like lowhanging clouds above the trees but for hours no one knew how the battle was going By late afternoon the first news came but it was uncertain contradictory frightening brought as it was by men wounded in the early hours of the battle These men began straggling in singly and in groups the less seriously wounded supporting those who limped and staggered Soon a steady stream of them was established making their painful way into town toward the hospitals their faces black as negroes from powder stains dust and sweat their wounds unbandaged blood drying flies swarming about them Aunt Pittys was one of the first houses which the wounded reached as they struggled in from the north of the town and one after another they tottered to the gate sank down on the green lawn and croaked Water All that burning afternoon Aunt Pitty and her family black and white stood in the sun with buckets of water and bandages ladling drinks binding wounds until the bandages gave out and even the torn sheets and towels were exhausted Aunt Pitty completely forgot that the sight of blood always made her faint and she worked until her little feet in their too small shoes swelled and would no longer support her Even Melanie now great with child forgot her modesty and worked feverishly side by side with Prissy Cookie and Scarlett her face as tense as any of the wounded When at last she fainted there was no place to lay her except on the kitchen table as every bed chair and sofa in the house was filled with wounded Forgotten in the tumult little Wade crouched behind the banisters on the front porch peering out onto the lawn like a caged frightened rabbit his eyes wide with terror sucking his thumb and hiccoughing Once Scarlett saw him and cried sharply Go play in the back yard Wade Hampton but he was too terrified too fascinated by the mad scene before him to obey The lawn was covered with prostrate men too tired to walk farther too weak from wounds to move These Uncle Peter loaded into the carriage and drove to the hospital making trip after trip until the old horse was lathered Mrs Meade and Mrs Merriwether sent their carriages and they too drove off springs sagging beneath the weight of the wounded Later in the long hot summer twilight the ambulances came rumbling down the road from the battle field and commissary wagons covered with muddy canvas Then farm wagons ox carts and even private carriages commandeered by the medical corps They passed Aunt Pittys house jolting over the bumpy road packed with wounded and dying men dripping blood into the red dust At the sight of the women with buckets and dippers the conveyances halted and the chorus went up in cries in whispers Water Scarlett held wobbling heads that parched lips might drink poured buckets of water over dusty feverish bodies and into open wounds that the men might enjoy a brief moments relief She tiptoed to hand dippers to ambulance drivers and of each she questioned her heart in her throat What news What news From all came back the answer Dont know fer sartin lady Its too soon to tell Night came and it was sultry No air moved and the flaring pine knots the negroes held made the air hotter Dust clogged Scarletts nostrils and dried her lips Her lavender calico dress so freshly clean and starched that morning was streaked with blood dirt and sweat This then was what Ashley had meant when he wrote that war was not glory but dirt and misery Fatigue gave an unreal nightmarish cast to the whole scene It couldnt be realor it was real then the world had gone mad If not why should she be standing here in Aunt Pittys peaceful front yard amid wavering lights pouring water over dying beaux For so many of them were her beaux and they tried to smile when they saw her There were so many men jolting down this dark dusty road whom she knew so well so many men dying here before her eyes mosquitoes and gnats swarming their bloody faces men with whom she had danced and laughed for whom she had played music and sung songs teased comforted and loveda little She found Carey Ashburn on the bottom layer of wounded in an ox cart barely alive from a bullet wound in his head But she could not extricate him without disturbing six other wounded men so she let him go on to the hospital Later she heard he had died before a doctor ever saw him and was buried somewhere no one knew exactly So many men had been buried that month in shallow hastily dug graves at Oakland Cemetery Melanie felt it keenly that they had not been able to get a lock of Careys hair to send to his mother in Alabama As the hot night wore on and their backs were aching and their knees buckling from weariness Scarlett and Pitty cried to man after man What news What news And as the long hours dragged past they had their answer an answer that made them look whitely into each others eyes Were falling back Weve got to fall back They outnumber us by thousands The Yankees have got Wheelers cavalry cut off near Decatur We got to reinforce them Our boys will all be in town soon Scarlett and Pitty clutched each others arms for support  Page    Gone With The Wind Areare the Yankees coming Yesm theyre comin all right but they aint goin ter git fer lady Dont fret Miss they cant take Atlanta No Mam we got a million miles of breastworks round this town I heard Old Joe say it myself I can hold Atlanta forever  But we aint got Old Joe We got Shut up you fool Do you want to scare the ladies The Yankees will never take this place Mam Whynt you ladies go ter Macon or somewheres thats safer Aint you got no kinfolks there The Yankees aint goin ter take Atlanta but still it aint goin ter be so healthy for ladies whilst theyre tryin it Theres goin ter be a powerful lot of shellin In a warm steaming rain the next day the defeated army poured through Atlanta by thousands exhausted by hunger and weariness depleted by seventysix days of battie and retreat their horses starved scarecrows their cannon and caissons harnessed with odds and ends of rope and strips of rawhide But they did not come in as disorderly rabble in full rout They marched in good order jaunty for all their rags their torn red battle flags flying in the rain They had learned retreating under Old Joe who had made it as great a feat of strategy as advancing The bearded shabby files swung down Peachtree Street to the tune of Maryland My Maryland and all the town turned out to cheer them In victory or defeat they were their boys The state militia who had gone out so short a time before resplendent in new uniforms could hardly be distinguished from the seasoned troops so dirty and unkempt were they There was a new look in their eyes Three years of apologizing of explaining why they were not at the front was behind them now They had traded security behind the lines for the hardships of battle Many of their number had traded easy living for hard death They were veterans now veterans of brief service but veterans just the same and they had acquitted themselves well They searched out the faces of friends in the crowd and stared at them proudly defiantly They could hold up their heads now The old men and boys of the Home Guard marched by the graybeards almost too weary to lift their feet the boys wearing the faces of tired children confronted too early with adult problems Scarlett caught sight of Phil Meade and hardly recognized him so black was his face with powder and grime so taut with strain and weariness Uncle Henry went limping by hatless in the rain his head stuck through a hole in a piece of old oilcloth Grandpa Merriwether rode in on a gun carriage his bare feet tied in quilt scraps But search though she might she saw no sign of John Wilkes Johnstons veterans however went by with the tireless careless step which had carried them for three years and they still had the energy to grin and wave at pretty girls and to call rude gibes to men not in uniform They were on their way to the entrenchments that ringed the townno shallow hastily dug trenches these but earthworks breast high reinforced with sandbags and tipped with sharpened staves of wood For mile after mile the trenches encircled the town red gashes surmounted by red mounds waiting for the men who would fill them The crowd cheered the troops as they would have cheered them in victory There was fear in every heart but now that they knew the truth now that the worst had happened now that the war was in their front yard a change came over the town There was no panic now no hysteria Whatever lay in hearts did not show on faces Everyone looked cheerful even if the cheer was strained Everyone tried to show brave confident faces to the troops Everyone repeated what Old Joe had said just before he was relieved of command I can hold Atlanta forever Now that Hood had had to retreat quite a number wished with the soldiers that they had Old Joe back but they forbore saying it and took courage from Old Joes remark I can hold Atlanta forever Not for Hood the cautious tactics of General Johnston He assaulted the Yankees on the east he assaulted them on the west Sherman was circling the town like a wrestler seeking a fresh hold on an opponents body and Hood did not remain behind his rifle pits waiting for the Yankees to attack He went out boldly to meet them and savagely fell upon them Within the space of a few days the battles of Atlanta and of Ezra Church were fought and both of them were major engagements which made Peachtree Creek seem like a skirmish But the Yankees kept coming back for more They had suffered heavy losses but they could afford to lose And all the while their batteries poured shells into Atlanta killing people in their homes ripping roofs off buildings tearing huge craters in the streets The townsfolk sheltered as best they could in cellars in holes in the ground and in shallow tunnels dug in railroad cuts Atlanta was under siege Within eleven days after he had taken command General Hood had lost almost as many men as Johnston had lost in seventyfour days of battle and retreat and Atlanta was hemmed in on three sides The railroad from Atlanta to Tennessee was now in Shermans hands for its full length His army was across the railroad to the east and he had cut the railroad running southwest to Alabama Only the one railroad to the south to Macon and Savannah was still open The town was crowded with soldiers swamped with wounded jammed with refugees and this one line was inadequate for the crying needs of the stricken city But as long as this railroad could be held Atlanta could still stand Scarlett was terrified when she realized how important this line had become how fiercely Sherman would fight to take it how desperately Hood would fight to defend it For this was the railroad which ran through the County through Jonesboro And Tara was only five miles from Jonesboro Tara seemed like a haven of refuge by comparison with the screaming hell of Atlanta but Tara was only five miles from Jonesboro Scarlett and many other ladies sat on the flat roofs of stores shaded by their tiny parasols and watched the fighting on the day of the battle of Atlanta But when shells began falling in the streets for the first time they fled to the cellars and that night the exodus of women children and old people from the city began Macon was their destination and many of those who took the train that night had already refugeed five and six times before as Johnston fell back from Dalton They were traveling lighter now than when they arrived in Atlanta Most of them carried only a carpetbag and a scanty lunch done up in a bandana handkerchief Here and there frightened servants carried silver pitchers knives and forks and a family portrait or two which had been salvaged in the first fight  Page    Gone With The Wind Mrs Merriwether and Mrs Elsing refused to leave They were needed at the hospital and furthermore they said proudly they werent afraid and no Yankees were going to run them out of their homes But Maybelle and her baby and Fanny Elsing went to Macon Mrs Meade was disobedient for the first time in her married life and flatly refused to yield to the doctors command that she take the train to safety The doctor needed her she said Moreover Phil was somewhere in the trenches and she wanted to be near by in case  But Mrs Whiting went and many other ladies of Scarletts circle Aunt Pitty who had been the first to denounce Old Joe for his policy of retreat was among the first to pack her trunks Her nerves she said were delicate and she could not endure noises She feared she might faint at an explosion and not be able to reach the cellar No she was not afraid Her baby mouth tried to set in martial lines but failed Shed go to Macon and stay with her cousin old Mrs Burr and the girls should come with her Scarlett did not want to go to Macon Frightened as she was of the shells shed rather stay in Atlanta than go to Macon for she hated old Mrs Burr cordially Years ago Mrs Burr had said she was fast after catching her kissing her son Willie at one of the Wilkes house parties No she told Aunt Pitty Ill go home to Tara and Melly can go to Macon with you At this Melanie began to cry in a frightened heartbroken way When Aunt Pitty fled to get Dr Meade Melanie caught Scarletts hand in hers pleading Dear dont go to Tara and leave me Ill be so lonely without you Oh Scarlett Id just die if you werent with me when the baby came Yes Yes I know Ive got Aunt Pitty and she is sweet But after all shes never had a baby and sometimes she makes me so nervous I could scream Dont desert me darling Youve been just like a sister to me and besides she smiled wanly you promised Ashley youd take care of me He told me he was going to ask you Scarlett stared down at her in wonderment With her own dislike of this woman so strong she could barely conceal it how could Melly love her so How could Melly be so stupid as not to guess the secret of her love of Ashley She had given herself away a hundred times during these months of torment waiting for news of him But Melanie saw nothing Melanie who could see nothing but good in anyone she loved  Yes she had promised Ashley she would look out for Melanie Oh Ashley Ashley you must be dead dead these many months And now your promise reaches out and clutches me Well she said shortly I did promise him that and I dont go back on my promises But I wont go to Macon and stay with that old Burr cat Id claw her eyes out in five minutes Im going home to Tara and you can come with me Mother would love to have you Oh Id like that Your mother is so sweet But you know Auntie would just die if she wasnt with me when the baby came and I know she wont go to Tara Its too close to the fighting and Auntie wants to be safe Dr Meade who had arrived out of breath expecting to find Melanie in premature labor at least judging by Aunt Pittys alarmed summoning was indignant and said as much And upon learning the cause of the upset he settled the matter with words that left no room for argument Its out of the question for you to go to Macon Miss Melly I wont answer for you if you move The trains are crowded and uncertain and the passengers are liable to be put off in the woods at any time if the trains are needed for the wounded or troops and supplies In your condition But if I went to Tara with Scarlett I tell you I wont have you moved The train to Tara is the train to Macon and the same conditions prevail Moreover no one knows just where the Yankees are now but they are all over everywhere Your train might even be captured And even if you reached Jonesboro safely thered be a fivemile ride over a rough road before you ever reached Tara Its no trip for a woman in a delicate condition Besides theres not a doctor in the County since old Dr Fontaine joined the army But there are midwives I said a doctor he answered brusquely and his eyes unconsciously went over her tiny frame I wont have you moved It might be dangerous You dont want to have the baby on the train or in a buggy do you This medical frankness reduced the ladies to embarrassed blushes and silence Youve got to stay right here where I can watch you and you must stay in bed No running up and down stairs to cellars No not even if shells come right in the window After all theres not so much danger here Well have the Yankees beaten back in no time  Now Miss Pitty you go right on to Macon and leave the young ladies here Unchaperoned she cried aghast They are matrons said the doctor testily And Mrs Meade is just two houses away They wont be receiving any male company anyway with Miss Melly in her condition Good Heavens Miss Pitty This is war time We cant think of the proprieties now We must think of Miss Melly He stamped out of the room and waited on the front porch until Scarlett joined him I shall talk frankly to you Miss Scarlett he began jerking at his gray beard You seem to be a young woman of common sense so spare me your blushes I do not want to hear any further talk about Miss Melly being moved I doubt if she could stand the trip She is going to have a difficult time even in the best of circumstancesvery narrow in the hips as you know and probably will need forceps for her delivery so I dont want any ignorant darky midwife meddling with her Women like her should never have children but Anyway you pack Miss Pittys trunk and send her to Macon Shes so scared shell upset Miss Melly and that wont do any good And now Miss he fixed her with a piercing glance I dont want to hear about you going home either You stay with Miss Melly till the baby comes Not afraid are you Oh no lied Scarlett stoutly Thats a brave girl Mrs Meade will give you whatever chaperonage you need and Ill send over old Betsy to cook for you if Miss Pitty wants to take her servants with her It wont be for long The baby ought to be here in another five weeks but you never can tell with first babies and all this shelling going on It may come any day So Aunt Pittypat went to Macon in floods of tears taking Uncle Peter and Cookie with her The carriage and horse she donated to the hospital in a burst of patriotism which she immediately regretted and that brought on more tears And Scarlett and Melanie were left alone with Wade and Prissy in a house that was much quieter even though the cannonading continued  Page    Gone With The Wind CHAPTER XIX IN THOSE FIRST DAYS of the siege when the Yankees crashed here and there against the defenses of the city Scarlett was so frightened by the bursting shells she could only cower helplessly her hands over her ears expecting every moment to be blown into eternity When she heard the whistling screams that heralded their approach she rushed to Melanies room and flung herself on the bed beside her and the two clutched each other screaming Oh Oh as they buried their heads in the pillows Prissy and Wade scurried for the cellar and crouched in the cobwebbed darkness Prissy squalling at the top of her voice and Wade sobbing and hiccoughing Suffocating under feather pillows while death screamed overhead Scarlett silently cursed Melanie for keeping her from the safer regions below stairs But the doctor had forbidden Melanie to walk and Scarlett had to stay with her Added to her terror of being blown to pieces was her equally active terror that Melanies baby might arrive at any moment Sweat broke out on Scarlett with clammy dampness whenever this thought entered her mind What would she do if the baby started coming She knew shed rather let Melanie die than go out on the streets to hunt for the doctor when the shells were falling like April rain And she knew Prissy could be beaten to death before she would venture forth What would she do if the baby came These matters she discussed with Prissy in whispers one evening as they prepared Melanies supper tray and Prissy surprisingly enough calmed her fears Miss Scarlett effen we kain git de doctah wen Miss Mellys time come doan you bodder Ah kin manage Ah knows all bout birthin Ain mah ma a midwife Ain she raise me ter be a midwife too Jes you leave it ter me Scarlett breathed more easily knowing that experienced hands were near but she nevertheless yearned to have the ordeal over and done with Mad to be away from exploding shells desperate to get home to the quiet of Tara she prayed every night that the baby would arrive the next day so she would be released from her promise and could leave Atlanta Tara seemed so safe so far away from all this misery Scarlett longed for home and her mother as she had never longed for anything in all her life If she were just near Ellen she wouldnt be afraid no matter what happened Every night after a day of screeching earsplitting shells she went to bed determined to tell Melanie the next morning that she could not stand Atlanta another day that she would have to go home and Melanie would have to go to Mrs Meades But as she lay on her pillow there always rose the memory of Ashleys face as it had looked when she last saw him drawn as with an inner pain but with a little smile on his lips Youll take care of Melanie wont you Youre so strong  Promise me And she had promised Somewhere Ashley lay dead Wherever he was he was watching her holding her to that promise Living or dead she could not fail him no matter what the cost So she remained day after day In response to Ellens letters pleading with her to come home she wrote minimizing the dangers of the siege explaining Melanies predicament and promising to come as soon as the baby was born Ellen sensitive to the bonds of kin be they blood or marriage wrote back reluctantly agreeing that she must stay but demanding Wade and Prissy be sent home immediately This suggestion met with the complete approval of Prissy who was now reduced to teethchattering idiocy at every unexpected sound She spent so much time crouching in the cellar that the girls would have fared badly but for Mrs Meades stolid old Betsy Scarlett was as anxious as her mother to have Wade out of Atlanta not only for the childs safety but because his constant fear irritated her Wade was terrified to speechlessness by the shelling and even when lulls came he clung to Scarletts skirts too terrified to cry He was afraid to go to bed at night afraid of the dark afraid to sleep lest the Yankees should come and get him and the sound of his soft nervous whimpering in the night grated unendurably on her nerves Secretly she was just as frightened as he was but it angered her to be reminded of it every minute by his tense drawn face Yes Tara was the place for Wade Prissy should take him there and return immediately to be present when the baby came But before Scarlett could start the two on their homeward journey news came that the Yankees had swung to the south and were skirmishing along the railroad between Atlanta and Jonesboro Suppose the Yankees should capture the train on which Wade and Prissy were ridingScarlett and Melanie turned pale at the thought for everyone knew that Yankee atrocities on helpless children were even more dreadful than on women So she feared to send him home and he remained in Atlanta a frightened silent little ghost pattering about desperately after his mother fearing to have her skirt out of his hand for even a min ute The siege went on through the hot days of July thundering days following nights of sullen ominous stillness and the town began to adjust itself It was as though the worst having happened they had nothing more to fear They had feared a siege and now they had a siege and after all it wasnt so bad Life could and did go on almost as usual They knew they were sitting on a volcano but until that volcano erupted there was nothing they could do So why worry now And probably it wouldnt erupt anyway Just look how General Hood is holding the Yankees out of the city And see how the cavalry is holding the railroad to Macon Sherman will never take it But for all their apparent insouciance in the face of falling shells and shorter rations for all their ignoring the Yankees barely half a mile away and for all their boundless confidence in the ragged line of gray men in the rifle pits there pulsed just below the skin of Atlanta a wild uncertainty over what the next day would bring Suspense worry sorrow hunger and the torment of rising falling rising hope was wearing that skin thin Gradually Scarlett drew courage from the brave faces of her friends and from the merciful adjustment which nature makes when what cannot be cured must be endured To be sure she still jumped at the sound of explosions but she did not run screaming to burrow her head under Melanies pillow She could now gulp and say weakly That was close wasnt it She was less frightened also because life had taken on the quality of a dream a dream too terrible to be real It wasnt possible that she Scarlett OHara should be in such a predicament with the danger of death about her every hour every minute It wasnt possible that the quiet tenor of life could have changed so completely in so short a time It was unreal grotesquely unreal that morning skies which dawned so tenderly blue could be profaned with cannon smoke that  Page    Gone With The Wind hung over the town like low thunder clouds that warm noontides filled with the piercing sweetness of massed honeysuckle and climbing roses could be so fearful as shells screamed into the streets bursting like the crack of doom throwing iron splinters hundreds of yards blowing people and animals to bits Quiet drowsy afternoon siestas had ceased to be for though the clamor of battle might lull from time to time Peachtree Street was alive and noisy at all hours cannon and ambulances rumbling by wounded stumbling in from the rifle pits regiments hurrying past at doublequick ordered from the ditches on one side of town to the defense of some hardpressed earthworks on the other and couriers dashing headlong down the street toward headquarters as though the fate of the Confederacy hung on them The hot nights brought a measure of quiet but it was a sinister quiet When the night was still it was too stillas though the tree frogs katydids and sleepy mockingbirds were too frightened to raise their voices in the usual summernight chorus Now and again the quiet was broken sharply by the crackcracking of musket fire in the last line of defenses Often in the late night hours when the lamps were out and Melanie asleep and deathly silence pressed over the town Scarlett lying awake heard the latch of the front gate click and soft urgent tappings on the front door Always faceless soldiers stood on the dark porch and from the darkness many different voices spoke to her Sometimes a cultured voice came from the shadows Madam my abject apologies for disturbing you but could I have water for myself and my horse Sometimes it was the hard burring of a mountain voice sometimes the odd nasals of the flat Wiregrass country to the far south occasionally the lulling drawl of the Coast that caught at her heart reminding her of Ellens voice Missy I got a pardner here who I wuz aimin ter git ter the horsepittle but looks like he aint goin ter last that fer Kin you take him in Lady I shore could do with some vittles Id shore relish a corn pone if it didnt deprive you none Madam forgive my intrusion butcould I spend the night on your porch I saw the roses and smelled the honeysuckle and it was so much like home that I was emboldened No these nights were not real They were a nightmare and the men were part of that nightmare men without bodies or faces only tired voices speaking to her from the warm dark Draw water serve food lay pillows on the front porch bind wounds hold the dirty heads of the dying No this could not be happening to her Once late in July it was Uncle Henry Hamilton who came tapping in the night Uncle Henry was minus his umbrella and carpetbag now and his fat stomach as well The skin of his pink fat face hung down in loose folds like the dewlaps of a bulldog and his long white hair was indescribably dirty He was almost barefoot crawling with lice and he was hungry but his irascible spirit was unimpaired Despite his remark Its a foolish war when old fools like me are out toting guns the girls received the impression that Uncle Henry was enjoying himself He was needed like the young men and he was doing a young mans work Moreover he could keep up with the young men which was more than Grandpa Merriwether could do he told them gleefully Grandpas lumbago was troubling him greatly and the Captain wanted to discharge him But Grandpa wouldnt go home He said frankly that he preferred the Captains swearing and bullying to his daughterinlaws coddling and her incessant demands that he give up chewing tobacco and launder his beard every day Uncle Henrys visit was brief for he had only a fourhour furlough and he needed half of it for the long walk in from the breastworks and back Girls Im not going to see you all for a while he announced as he sat in Melanies bedroom luxuriously wriggling his blistered feet in the tub of cold water Scarlett had set before him Our company is going out in the morning Where questioned Melanie frightened clutching his arm Dont put your hand on me said Uncle Henry irritably Im crawling with lice War would be a picnic if it wasnt for lice and dysentery Wherem I going Well I havent been told but Ive got a good idea Were marching south toward Jonesboro in the morning unless Im greatly in error Oh why toward Jonesboro Because theres going to be big fighting there Missy The Yankees are going to take the railroad if they possibly can And if they do take it its goodby Atlanta Oh Uncle Henry do you think they will Shucks girls No How can they when Im there Uncle Henry grinned at their frightened faces and then becoming serious again Its going to be a hard fight girls Weve got to win it You know of course that the Yankees have got all the railroads except the one to Macon but that isnt all theyve got Maybe you girls didnt know it but theyve got every road too every wagon lane and bridle path except the McDonough road Atlantas in a bag and the strings of the bag are at Jonesboro And if the Yankees can take the railroad there they can pull up the strings and have us just like a possum in a poke So we dont aim to let them get that railroad  I may be gone a while girls I just came in to tell you all goodby and to make sure Scarlett was still with you Melly Of course shes with me said Melanie fondly Dont you worry about us Uncle Henry and do take care of yourself Uncle Henry wiped his wet feet on the rag rug and groaned as he drew on his tattered shoes I got to be going he said Ive got five miles to walk Scarlett you fix me up some kind of lunch to take Anything youve got After he had kissed Melanie goodby he went down to the kitchen where Scarlett was wrapping a corn pone and some apples in a napkin Uncle Henryis itis it really so serious Serious Godlmighty yes Dont be a goose Were in the last ditch Do you think theyll get to Tara Why began Uncle Henry irritated at the feminine mind which thought only of personal things when broad issues were involved Then seeing her frightened woebegone face he softened  Page    Gone With The Wind Of course they wont Taras five miles from the railroad and its the railroad the Yankees want Youve got no more sense than a June bug Missy He broke off abruptly I didnt walk all this way here tonight just to tell you all goodby I came to bring Melly some bad news but when I got up to it I just couldnt tell her So Im going to leave it to you to do Ashley isntyou havent heard anythingthat hes dead Now how would I be hearing about Ashley when Ive been standing in rifle pits up to the seat of my pants in mud the old gentleman asked testily No Its about his father John Wilkes is dead Scarlett sat down suddenly the halfwrapped lunch in her hand I came to tell Mellybut I couldnt You must do it And give her these He hauled from his pockets a heavy gold watch with dangling seals a small miniature of the long dead Mrs Wilkes and a pair of massive cuff buttons At the sight of the watch which she had seen in John Wilkes hands a thousand times the full realization came over Scarlett that Ashleys father was really dead And she was too stunned to cry or to speak Uncle Henry fidgeted coughed and did not look at her lest he catch sight of a tear that would upset him He was a brave man Scarlett Tell Melly that Tell her to write it to his girls And a good soldier for all his years A shell got him Came right down on him and his horse Tore the horses I shot the horse myself poor creature A fine little mare she was Youd better write Mrs Tarleton about that too She set a store on that mare Wrap up my lunch child I must be going There dear dont take it so hard What better way can an old man die than doing a young mans work Oh he shouldnt have died He shouldnt have ever gone to the war He should have lived and seen his grandchild grow up and died peacefully in bed Oh why did he go He didnt believe in secession and he hated the war and Plenty of us think that way but what of it Uncle Henry blew his nose grumpily Do you think I enjoy letting Yankee riflemen use me for a target at my age But theres no other choice for a gentleman these days Kiss me goodby child and dont worry about me Ill come through this war safely Scarlett kissed him and heard him go down the steps into the dark heard the latch click on the front gate She stood for a minute looking at the keepsakes in her hand And then she went up the stairs to tell Melanie At the end of July came the unwelcome news predicted by Uncle Henry that the Yankees had swung around again toward Jonesboro They had cut the railroad four miles below the town but they had been beaten off by the Confederate cavalry and the engineering corps sweating in the broiling sun had repaired the line Scarlett was frantic with anxiety For three days she waited fear growing in her heart Then a reassuring letter came from Gerald The enemy had not reached Tara They had heard the sound of the fight but they had seen no Yankees Geralds letter was so full of brag and bluster as to how the Yankees had been driven from the railroad that one would have thought he personally had accomplished the feat single handed He wrote for three pages about the gallantry of the troops and then at the end of his letter mentioned briefly that Carreen was ill The typhoid Mrs OHara said it was She was not very ill and Scarlett was not to worry about her but on no condition must she come home now even if the railroad should become safe Mrs OHara was very glad now that Scarlett and Wade had not come home when the siege began Mrs OHara said Scarlett must go to church and say some Rosaries for Carreens recovery Scarletts conscience smote her at this last for it had been months since she had been to church Once she would have thought this omission a mortal sin but somehow staying away from church did not seem so sinful now as it formerly had But she obeyed her mother and going to her room gabbled a hasty Rosary When she rose from her knees she did not feel as comforted as she had formerly felt after prayer For some time she had felt that God was not watching out for her the Confederates or the South in spite of the millions of prayers ascending to Him daily That night she sat on the front porch with Geralds letter in her bosom where she could touch it occasionally and bring Tara and Ellen closer to her The lamp in the parlor window threw odd golden shadows onto the dark vineshrouded porch and the matted tangle of yellow climbing roses and honeysuckle made a wall of mingled fragrance about her The night was utterly still Not even the crack of a rifle had sounded since sunset and the world seemed far away Scarlett rocked back and forth lonely miserable since reading the news from Tara wishing that someone anyone even Mrs Merriwether were with her But Mrs Merriwether was on night duty at the hospital Mrs Meade was at home making a feast for Phil who was in from the front lines and Melanie was asleep There was not even the hope of a chance caller Visitors had fallen off to nothing this last week for every man who could walk was in the rifle pits or chasing the Yankees about the countryside near Jonesboro It was not often that she was alone like this and she did not like it When she was alone she had to think and these days thoughts were not so pleasant Like everyone else she had fallen into the habit of thinking of the past the dead Tonight when Atlanta was so quiet she could close her eyes and imagine she was back in the rural stillness of Tara and that life was unchanged unchanging But she knew that life in the County would never be the same again She thought of the four Tarletons the redhaired twins and Tom and Boyd and a passionate sadness caught at her throat Why either Stu or Brent might have been her husband But now when the war was over and she went back to Tara to live she would never again hear their wild halloos as they dashed up the avenue of cedars And Raiford Calvert who danced so divinely would never again choose her to be his partner And the Munroe boys and little Joe Fontaine and Oh Ashley she sobbed dropping her head into her hands Ill never get used to you being gone She heard the front gate click and she hastily raised her head and dashed her hand across her wet eyes She rose and saw it was Rhett Butler coming up the walk carrying his wide Panama hat in his hand She had not seen him since the day when she had alighted from his carriage so precipitously at Five Points On that occasion she had expressed the desire never to lay eyes on him again But she was so glad now to have someone to talk to someone to divert her thoughts from Ashley that she hastily put the memory from her mind Evidently he had forgotten the contretemps or pretended to have forgotten it for he settled himself on the top step at her feet without mention of their late difference So you didnt refugee to Macon I heard that Miss Pitty had retreated and of course I thought you had gone too So when I saw your light I came here to investigate Why did you stay  Page    Gone With The Wind To keep Melanie company You see shewell she cant refugee just now Thunderation he said and in the lamplight she saw that he was frowning You dont mean to tell me Mrs Wilkes is still here I never heard of such idiocy Its quite dangerous for her in her condition Scarlett was silent embarrassed for Melanies condition was not a subject she could discuss with a man She was embarrassed too that Rhett should know it was dangerous for Melanie Such knowledge sat ill upon a bachelor Its quite ungallant of you not to think that I might get hurt too she said tartly His eyes flickered with amusement Id back you against the Yankees any day Im not sure that thats a compliment she said uncertainly It isnt he answered When will you stop looking for compliments in mens lightest utterances When Im on my deathbed she replied and smiled thinking that there would always be men to compliment her even if Rhett never did Vanity vanity he said At least you are frank about it He opened his cigar case extracted a black cigar and held it to his nose for a moment A match flared he leaned back against a post and clasping his hands about his knees smoked a while in silence Scarlett resumed her rocking and the still darkness of the warm night closed about them The mockingbird which nested in the tangle of roses and honeysuckle roused from slumber and gave one timid liquid note Then as if thinking better of the matter it was silent again From the shadow of the porch Rhett suddenly laughed a low soft laugh So you stayed with Mrs Wilkes This is the strangest situation I ever encountered I see nothing strange about it she answered uncomfortably immediately on the alert No But then you lack the impersonal viewpoint My impression has been for some time past that you could hardly endure Mrs Wilkes You think her silly and stupid and her patriotic notions bore you You seldom pass by the opportunity to slip in some belittling remark about her so naturally it seems strange to me that you should elect to do the unselfish thing and stay here with her during this shelling Now just why did you do it Because shes Charlies sisterand like a sister to me answered Scarlett with as much dignity as possible though her cheeks were growing hot You mean because shes Ashleys Wilkes widow Scarlett rose quickly struggling with her anger I was almost on the point of forgiving you for your former boorish conduct but now I shant do it I wouldnt have ever let you come upon this porch at all if I hadnt been feeling so blue and Sit down and smooth your ruffled fur he said and his voice changed He reached up and taking her hand pulled her back into her chair Why are you blue Oh I had a letter from Tara today The Yankees are close to home and my little sister is ill with typhoid andandso now even if I could go home like I want to Mother wouldnt let me for fear Id catch it too Oh dear and I do so want to go home Well dont cry about it he said but his voice was kinder You are much safer here in Atlanta even if the Yankees do come than youd be at Tara The Yankees wont hurt you and typhoid would The Yankees wouldnt hurt me How can you say such a lie My dear girl the Yankees arent fiends They havent horns and hoofs as you seem to think They are pretty much like Southernersexcept with worse manners of course and terrible accents Why the Yankees would Rape you I think not Though of course theyd want to If you are going to talk vilely I shall go into the house she cried grateful that the shadows hid her crimson face Be frank Wasnt that what you were thinking Oh certainly not Oh but it was No use getting mad at me for reading your thoughts Thats what all our delicately nurtured and pureminded Southern ladies think They have it on their minds constantly Ill wager even dowagers like Mrs Merriwether  Scarlett gulped in silence remembering that wherever two or more matrons were gathered together in these trying days they whispered of such happenings always in Virginia or Tennessee or Louisiana never close to home The Yankees raped women and ran bayonets through childrens stomachs and burned houses over the heads of old people Everyone knew these things were true even if they didnt shout them on the street corners And if Rhett had any decency he would realize they were true And not talk about them And it wasnt any laughing matter either She could hear him chuckling softly Sometimes he was odious In fact most of the time he was odious It was awful for a man to know what women really thought about and talked about It made a girl feel positively undressed And no man ever learned such things from good women either She was indignant that he had read her mind She liked to believe herself a thing of mystery to men but she knew Rhett thought her as transparent as glass Speaking of such matters he continued have you a protector or chaperon in the house The admirable Mrs Merriwether or Mrs Meade They always look at me as if they knew I was here for no good purpose Mrs Meade usually comes over at night answered Scarlett glad to change the subject But she couldnt tonight Phil her boy is home What luck he said softly to find you alone Something in his voice made her heart beat pleasantly faster and she felt her face flush She had heard that note in mens voices often enough to know that it presaged a declaration of love Oh what fun If he would just say he loved her how she would torment him and get even with him for all the sarcastic remarks he had flung at her these past three years She would lead him a chase that would make up for even that awful humiliation of the day he witnessed her slapping Ashley And then shed tell him sweetly she could only be a sister to him and retire with the full honors of war She laughed nervously in pleasant anticipation  Page    Gone With The Wind Dont giggle he said and taking her hand he turned it over and pressed his lips into the palm Something vital electric leaped from him to her at the touch of his warm mouth something that caressed her whole body thrillingly His lips traveled to her wrist and she knew he must feel the leap of her pulse as her heart quickened and she tried to draw back her hand She had not bargained on thisthis treacherous warm tide of feeling that made her want to run her hands through his hair to feel his lips upon her mouth She wasnt in love with him she told herself confusedly She was in love with Ashley But how to explain this feeling that made her hands shake and the pit of her stomach grow cold He laughed softly Dont pull away I wont hurt you Hurt me Im not afraid of you Rhett Butler or of any man in shoe leather she cried furious that her voice shook as well as her hands An admirable sentiment but do lower your voice Mrs Wilkes might hear you And pray compose yourself He sounded as though delighted at her flurry Scarlett you do like me dont you That was more like what she was expecting Well sometimes she answered cautiously When you arent acting like a varmint He laughed again and held the palm of her hand against his hard cheek I think you like me because I am a varmint Youve known so few dyedinthewool varmints in your sheltered life that my very difference holds a quaint charm for you This was not the turn she had anticipated and she tried again without success to pull her hand free Thats not true I like nice menmen you can depend on to always be gentlemanly You mean men you can always bully Its merely a matter of definition But no matter He kissed her palm again and again the skin on the back of her neck crawled excitingly But you do like me Could you ever love me Scarlett Ah she thought triumphantly Now Ive got him And she answered with studied coolness Indeed no That isnot unless you mended your manners considerably And I have no intention of mending them So you could not love me That is as I hoped For while I like you immensely I do not love you and it would be tragic indeed for you to suffer twice from unrequited love wouldnt it dear May I call you dear Mrs Hamilton I shall call you dear whether you like it or not so no matter but the proprieties must be observed You dont love me No indeed Did you hope that I did Dont be so presumptuous You hoped Alas to blight your hopes I should love you for you are charming and talented at many useless accomplishments But many ladies have charm and accomplishments and are just as useless as you are No I dont love you But I do like you tremendouslyfor the elasticity of your conscience for the selfishness which you seldom trouble to hide and for the shrewd practicality in you which I fear you get from some not too remote Irishpeasant ancestor Peasant Why he was insulting her She began to splutter wordlessly Dont interrupt he begged squeezing her hand I like you because I have those same qualities in me and like begets liking I realize you still cherish the memory of the godlike and woodenheaded Mr Wilkes whos probably been in his grave these six months But there must be room in your heart for me too Scarlett do stop wriggling I am making you a declaration I have wanted you since the first time I laid eyes on you in the hall of Twelve Oaks when you were bewitching poor Charlie Hamilton I want you more than I have ever wanted any womanand Ive waited longer for you than Ive ever waited for any woman She was breathless with surprise at his last words In spite of all his insults he did love her and he was just so contrary he didnt want to come out frankly and put it into words for fear shed laugh Well shed show him and right quickly Are you asking me to marry you He dropped her hand and laughed so loudly she shrank back in her chair Good Lord no Didnt I tell you I wasnt a marrying man Butbutwhat He rose to his feet and hand on heart made her a burlesque bow Dear he said quietly I am complimenting your intelligence by asking you to be my mistress without having first seduced you Mistress Her mind shouted the word shouted that she had been vilely insulted But in that first startled moment she did not feel insulted She only felt a furious surge of indignation that he should think her such a fool He must think her a fool if he offered her a proposition like that instead of the proposal of matrimony she had been expecting Rage punctured vanity and disappointment threw her mind into a turmoil and before she even thought of the high moral grounds on which she should upbraid him she blurted out the first words which came to her lips Mistress What would I get out of that except a passel of brats And then her jaw dropped in horror as she realized what she had said He laughed until he choked peering at her in the shadows as she sat stricken dumb pressing her handkerchief to her mouth Thats why I like you You are the only frank woman I know the only woman who looks on the practical side of matters without beclouding the issue with mouthings about sin and morality Any other woman would have swooned first and then shown me the door Scarlett leaped to her feet her face red with shame How could she have said such a thing How could she Ellens daughter with her upbringing have sat there and listened to such debasing words and then made such a shameless reply She should have  Page    Gone With The Wind screamed She should have fainted She should have turned coldly away in silence and swept from the porch Too late now I will show you the door she shouted not caring if Melanie or the Meades down the street did hear her Get out How dare you say such things to me What have I ever done to encourage youto make you suppose  Get out and dont ever come back here I mean it this time Dont you ever come back here with any of your piddling papers of pins and ribbons thinking Ill forgive you IllIll tell my father and hell kill you He picked up his hat and bowed and she saw in the light of the lamp that his teeth were showing in a smile beneath his mustache He was not ashamed he was amused at what she had said and he was watching her with alert interest Oh he was detestable She swung round on her heel and marched into the house She grabbed hold of the door to shut it with a bang but the hook which held it open was too heavy for her She struggled with it panting May I help you he asked Feeling that she would burst a blood vessel if she stayed another minute she stormed up the stairs And as she reached the upper floor she heard him obligingly slam the door for her CHAPTER XX AS THE HOT noisy days of August were drawing to a close the bombardment abruptly ceased The quiet that fell on the town was startling Neighbors met on the streets and stared at one another uncertain uneasy as to what might be impending The stillness after the screaming days brought no surcease to strained nerves but if possible made the strain even worse No one knew why the Yankee batteries were silent there was no news of the troops except that they had been withdrawn in large num bers from the breastworks about the town and had marched off toward the south to defend the railroad No one knew where the fighting was if indeed there was any fighting or how the battle was going if there was a battle Nowadays the only news was that which passed from mouth to mouth Short of paper short of ink short of men the newspapers had suspended publication after the siege began and the wildest rumors appeared from nowhere and swept through the town Now in the anxious quiet crowds stormed General Hoods headquarters demanding information crowds massed about the telegraph office and the depot hoping for tidings good tidings for everyone hoped that the silence of Shermans cannon meant that the Yankees were in full retreat and the Confederates chasing them back up the road to Dalton But no news came The telegraph wires were still no trains came in on the one remaining railroad from the south and the mail service was broken Autumn with its dusty breathless heat was slipping in to choke the suddenly quiet town adding its dry panting weight to tired anxious hearts To Scarlett mad to hear from Tara yet trying to keep up a brave face it seemed an eternity since the siege began seemed as though she had always lived with the sound of cannon in her ears until this sinister quiet had fallen And yet it was only thirty days since the siege began Thirty days of siege The city ringed with redclay rifle pits the monotonous booming of cannon that never rested the long lines of ambulances and ox carts dripping blood down the dusty streets toward the hospitals the overworked burial squads dragging out men when they were hardly cold and dumping them like so many logs in endless rows of shallow ditches Only thirty days And it was only four months since the Yankees moved south from Dalton Only four months Scarlett thought looking back on that far day that it had occurred in another life Oh no Surely not just four months It had been a lifetime Four months ago Why four months ago Dalton Resaca Kennesaw Mountain had been to her only names of places on the railroad Now they were battles battles desperately vainly fought as Johnston fell back toward Atlanta And now Peachtree Creek Decatur Ezra Church and Utoy Creek were no longer pleasant names of pleasant places Never again could she think of them as quiet villages full of welcoming friends as green places where she picnicked with handsome officers on the soft banks of slowmoving streams These names meant battles too and the soft green grasses where she had sat were cut to bits by heavy cannon wheels trampled by desperate feet when bayonet met bayonet and flattened where bodies threshed in agonies  And the lazy streams were redder now than ever Georgia clay could make them Peachtree Creek was crimson so they said after the Yankees crossed it Peachtree Creek Decatur Ezra Church Utoy Creek Never names of places any more Names of graves where friends lay buried names of tangled underbrush and thick woods where bodies rotted unburied names of the four sides of Atlanta where Sherman had tried to force his army in and Hoods men had doggedly beaten him back At last news came from the south to the strained town and it was alarming news especially to Scarlett General Sherman was trying the fourth side of the town again striking again at the railroad at Jonesboro Yankees in large numbers were on that fourth side of the town now no skirmishing units or cavalry detachments but the massed Yankee forces And thousands of Confederate troops had been withdrawn from the lines close about the city to hurl themselves against them And that explained the sudden silence Why Jonesboro thought Scarlett terror striking at her heart at the thought of Taras nearness Why must they always hit Jonesboro Why cant they find some other place to attack the railroad For a week she had not heard from Tara and the last brief note from Gerald had added to her fears Carreen had taken a turn for the worse and was very very sick Now it might be days before the mails came through days before she heard whether Carreen was alive or dead Oh if she had only gone home at the beginning of the siege Melanie or no Melanie There was fighting at Jonesborothat much Atlanta knew but how the battle went no one could tell and the most insane rumors tortured the town Finally a courier came up from Jonesboro with the reassuring news that the Yankees had been beaten back But they had made a sortie into Jonesboro burned the depot cut the telegraph wires and torn up three miles of track before they retreated The engineering corps was working like mad repairing the line but it would take some time because the Yankees had torn up the crossties made bonfires of them laid the wrenchedup rails across them until they were red hot and then twisted them around telegraph poles until they looked like giant corkscrews These days it was so hard to replace iron rails to replace anything made of iron No the Yankees hadnt gotten to Tara The same courier who brought the dispatches to General Hood assured Scarlett of that  Page    Gone With The Wind He had met Gerald in Jonesboro after the battle just as he was starting to Atlanta and Gerald had begged him to bring a letter to her But what was Pa doing in Jonesboro The young courier looked ill at ease as he made answer Gerald was hunting for an army doctor to go to Tara with him As she stood in the sunshine on the front porch thanking the young man for his trouble Scarlett felt her knees go weak Carreen must be dying if she was so far beyond Ellens medical skill that Gerald was hunting a doctor As the courier went off in a small whirlwind of red dust Scarlett tore open Geralds letter with fingers that trembled So great was the shortage of paper in the Confederacy now that Geralds note was written between the lines of her last letter to him and reading it was difficult Dear Daughter Your Mother and both girls have the typhoid They are very ill but we must hope for the best When your mother took to her bed she bade me write you that under no condition were you to come home and expose yourself and Wade to the disease She sends her love and bids you pray for her Pray for her Scarlett flew up the stairs to her room and dropping on her knees by the bed prayed as she had never prayed before No formal Rosaries now but the same words over and over Mother of God dont let her die Ill be so good if you dont let her die Please dont let her die For the next week Scarlett crept about the house like a stricken animal waiting for news starting at every sound of horses hooves rushing down the dark stair at night when soldiers came tapping at the door but no news came from Tara The width of the continent might have spread between her and home instead of twentyfive miles of dusty road The mails were still disrupted no one knew where the Confederates were or what the Yankees were up to No one knew anything except that thousands  of soldiers gray and blue were somewhere between Atlanta and Jonesboro Not a word from Tara in a week Scarlett had seen enough typhoid in the Atlanta hospital to know what a week meant in that dread disease Ellen was ill perhaps dying and here was Scarlett helpless in Atlanta with a pregnant woman on her hands and two armies between her and home Ellen was illperhaps dying But Ellen couldnt be ill She had never been ill The very thought was incredible and it struck at the very foundations of the security of Scarletts life Everyone else got sick but never Ellen Ellen looked after sick people and made them well again She couldnt be sick Scarlett wanted to be home She wanted Tara with the desperate desire of a frightened child frantic for the only haven it had ever known Home The sprawling white house with fluttering white curtains at the windows the thick clover on the lawn with the bees busy in it the little black boy on the front steps shooing the ducks and turkeys from the flower beds the serene red fields and the miles and miles of cotton turning white in the sun Home If she had only gone home at the beginning of the siege when everyone else was refugeeing She could have taken Melanie with her in safety with weeks to spare Oh damn Melanie she thought a thousand times Why couldnt she have gone to Macon with Aunt Pitty Thats where she belongs with her own kinfolks not with me Im none of her blood Why does she hang onto me so hard If shed only gone to Macon then I could have gone home to Mother Even noweven now Id take a chance on getting home in spite of the Yankees if it wasnt for this baby Maybe General Hood would give me an escort Hes a nice man General Hood and I know I could make him give me an escort and a flag of truce to get me through the lines But I have to wait for this baby  Oh Mother Mother Dont die  Why dont this baby ever come Ill see Dr Meade today and ask him if theres any way to hurry babies up so I can go homeif I can get an escort Dr Meade said shed have a bad time Dear God Suppose she should die Melanie dead Melanie dead And Ashley No I mustnt think about that it isnt nice But Ashley No I mustnt think about that because hes probably dead anyway But he made me promise Id take care of her Butif I didnt take care of her and she died and Ashley is still alive No I mustnt think about that Its sinful And I promised God Id be good if He would just not let Mother die Oh if the baby would only come If I could only get away from hereget homeget anywhere but here Scarlett hated the sight of the ominously still town now and once she had loved it Atlanta was no longer the gay the desperately gay place she had loved It was a hideous place like a plaguestricken city so quiet so dreadfully quiet after the din of the siege There had been stimulation in the noise and the danger of the shelling There was only horror in the quiet that followed The town seemed haunted haunted with fear and uncertainty and memories Peoples faces looked pinched and the few soldiers Scarlett saw wore the exhausted look of racers forcing themselves on through the last lap of a race already lost The last day of August came and with it convincing rumors that the fiercest fighting since the battle of Atlanta was taking place Somewhere to the south Atlanta waiting for news of the turn of battle stopped even trying to laugh and joke Everyone knew now what the soldiers had known two weeks beforethat Atlanta was in the last ditch that if the Macon railroad fell Atlanta would fall too On the morning of the first of September Scarlett awoke with a suffocating sense of dread upon her a dread she had taken to her pillow the night before She thought dulled with sleep What was it I was worrying about when I went to bed last night Oh yes the fighting There was a battle somewhere yesterday Oh who won She sat up hastily rubbing her eyes and her worried heart took up yesterdays load again The air was oppressive even in the early morning hour hot with the scorching promise of a noon of glaring blue sky and pitiless bronze sun The road outside lay silent No wagons creaked by No troops raised the red dust with their tramping feet There were no sounds of negroes lazy voices in neighboring kitchens no pleasant sounds of breakfasts being prepared for all the near neighbors except Mrs Meade and Mrs Merriwether had refugeed to Macon And she could hear nothing from their houses either Farther down the street the business section was quiet and many of the stores and offices were locked and boarded up while their occupants were somewhere about the countryside with rifles in their hands The stillness that greeted her seemed even more sinister this morning than on any of the mornings of the queer quiet week preceding it She rose hastily without her usual preliminary burrowings and stretchings and went to the window hoping to see some neighbors face some heartening sight But the road was empty She noted how the leaves on the trees were still dark green  Page    Gone With The Wind but dry and heavily coated with red dust and how withered and sad the untended flowers in the front yard looked As she stood looking out of the window there came to her ears a faroff sound faint and sullen as the first distant thunder of an approaching storm Rain she thought in the first moment and her countrybred mind added we certainly need it But in a split instant Rain No Not rain Cannon Her heart racing she leaned from the window her ear cocked to the faroff roaring trying to discover from which direction it came But the dim thundering was so distant that for a moment she could not tell Make it from Marietta Lord she prayed Or Decatur Or Peachtree Creek But not from the south Not from the south She gripped the window still tighter and strained her ears and the faraway booming seemed louder And it was coming from the south Cannon to the south And to the south lay Jonesboro and Taraand Ellen Yankees perhaps at Tara now this minute She listened again but the blood thudding in her ears all but blurred out the sound of faroff firing No they couldnt be at Jonesboro yet If they were that far away the sound would be fainter more indistinct But they must be at least ten miles down the road toward Jonesboro probably near the little settlement of Rough and Ready But Jonesboro was scarcely more than ten miles below Rough and Ready Cannon to the south and they might be tolling the knell of Atlantas fall But to Scarlett sick for her mothers safety fighting to the south only meant fighting near Tara She walked the floor and wrung her hands and for the first time the thought in all its implications came to her that the gray army might be defeated It was the thought of Shermans thousands so close to Tara that brought it all home to her brought the full horror of the war to her as no sound of siege guns shattering windowpanes no privations of food and clothing and no endless rows of dying men had done Shermans army within a few miles of Tara And even if the Yankees should be defeated they might fall back down the road to Tara And Gerald couldnt possibly refugee out of their way with three sick women Oh if she were only there now Yankees or not She paced the floor in her bare feet her nightgown clinging to her legs and the more she walked the stronger became her foreboding She wanted to be at home She wanted to be near Ellen From the kitchen below she heard the rattle of china as Prissy prepared breakfast but no sound of Mrs Meades Betsy The shrill melancholy minor of Prissy was raised Jes a few mo days ter tote de weery load  The song grated on Scarlett its sad implications frightening her and slipping on a wrapper she pattered out into the hall and to the back stairs and shouted Shut up that singing Prissy A sullen Yasm drifted up to her and she drew a deep breath feeling suddenly ashamed of herself Wheres Betsy Ah doan know She ain came Scarlett walked to Melanies door and opened it a crack peering into the sunny room Melanie lay in bed in her nightgown her eyes closed and circled with black her heartshaped face bloated her slender body hideous and distorted Scarlett wished viciously that Ashley could see her now She looked worse than any pregnant woman she had ever seen As she looked Melanies eyes opened and a soft warm smile lit her face Come in she invited turning awkwardly on her side Ive been awake since sunup thinking and Scarlett theres something I want to ask you She entered the room and sat down on the bed that was glaring with harsh sunshine Melanie reached out and took Scarletts hand in a gentle confiding clasp Dear she said Im sorry about the cannon Its toward Jonesboro isnt it Scarlett said Um her heart beginning to beat faster as the thought recurred I know how worried you are I know youd have gone home last week when you heard about your mother if it hadnt been for me Wouldnt you Yes said Scarlett ungraciously Scarlett darling Youve been so good to me No sister could have been sweeter or braver And I love you for it Im so sorry Im in the way Scarlett stared Loved her did she The fool And Scarlett Ive been lying here thinking and I want to ask a very great favor of you Her clasp tightened If I should die will you take my baby Melanies eyes were wide and bright with soft urgency Will you Scarlett jerked away her hand as fear swamped her Fear roughened her voice as she spoke Oh dont be a goose Melly You arent going to die Every woman thinks shes going to die with her first baby I know I did No you didnt Youve never been afraid of anything You are just saying that to try to cheer me up Im not afraid to die but Im so afraid to leave the baby if Ashley is Scarlett promise me that youll take my baby if I should die Then I wont be afraid Aunt Pittypat is too old to raise a child and Honey and India are sweet butI want you to have my baby Promise me Scarlett And if its a boy bring him up like Ashley and if its a girldear Id like her to be like you Gods nightgown cried Scarlett leaping from the bed Arent things bad enough without you talking about dying Im sorry dear But promise me I think itll be today Im sure itll be today Please promise me Oh all right I promise said Scarlett looking down at her in bewilderment Was Melanie such a fool she really didnt know how she cared for Ashley Or did she know everything and feel that because of that love Scarlett would take good care of Ashleys child Scarlett had a wild impulse to cry out questions but they died on her lips as Melanie took her hand and held it for an instant against her cheek Tranquility had come back into her eyes Why do you think it will be today Melly Ive been having pains since dawnbut not very bad ones You have Well why didnt you call me Ill send Prissy for Dr Meade  Page    Gone With The Wind No dont do that yet Scarlett You know how busy he is how busy they all are Just send word to him that well need him some time today Send over to Mrs Meades and tell her and ask her to come over and sit with me Shell know when to really send for him Oh stop being so unselfish You know you need a doctor as much as anybody in the hospital Ill send for him right away No please dont Sometimes it takes all day having a baby and I just couldnt let the doctor sit here for hours when all those poor boys need him so much Just send for Mrs Meade Shell know Oh all right said Scarlett CHAPTER XXI AFTER SENDING UP Melanies breakfast tray Scarlett dispatched Prissy for Mrs Meade and sat down with Wade to eat her own breakfast But for once she had no appetite Between her nervous apprehension over the thought that Melanies time was approaching and her unconscious straining to hear the sound of the cannon she could hardly eat Her heart acted very queerly beating regularly for several minutes and then thumping so loudly and swiftly it almost made her sick at her stomach The heavy hominy stuck in her throat like glue and never before had the mixture of parched corn and groundup yams that passed for coffee been so repulsive Without sugar or cream it was bitter as gall for the sorghum used for long sweetening did little to improve the taste After one swallow she pushed her cup away If for no other reason she hated the Yankees because they kept her from having real coffee with sugar and thick cream in it Wade was quieter than usual and did not set up his every morning complaint against the hominy that he so disliked He ate silently the spoonfuls she pushed into his mouth and washed them down with noisily gulped water His soft brown eyes followed her every movement large round as dollars a childish bewilderment in them as though her own scarcehidden fears had been communicated to him When he had finished she sent him off to the back yard to play and watched him toddle across the straggling grass to his playhouse with great relief She arose and stood irresolutely at the foot of the stairs She should go up and sit with Melanie and distract her mind from her coming ordeal but she did not feel equal to it Of all days in the world Melanie had to pick this day to have the baby And of all days to talk about dying She sat down on the bottom step of the stairs and tried to compose herself wondering again how yesterdays battle had gone wondering how todays fighting was going How strange to have a big battle going on just a few miles away and to know nothing of it How strange the quiet of this deserted end of town in contrast with the day of the fighting at Peachtree Creek Aunt Pittys house was one of the last on the north side of Atlanta and with the fighting somewhere to the far south there were no reinforcements going by at doublequick no ambulances and staggering lines of walking wounded coming back She wondered if such scenes were being enacted on the south side of town and thanked God she was not there If only everyone except the Meades and the Merriwethers had not refugeed from this north end of Peachtree It made her feel forsaken and alone She wished fervently that Uncle Peter were with her so he could go down to headquarters and learn the news If it wasnt for Melanie shed go to town this very minute and learn for herself but she couldnt leave until Mrs Meade arrived Mrs Meade Why didnt she come on And where was Prissy She rose and went out onto the front porch and looked for them impatiently but the Meade house was around a shady bend in the street and she could see no one After a long while Prissy came into view alone switching her skirts from side to side and looking over her shoulder to observe the effect Youre as slow as molasses in January snapped Scarlett as Prissy opened the gate What did Mrs Meade say How soon will she be over here She warnt dar said Prissy Where is she When will she be home Welm answered Prissy dragging out her words pleasurably to give more weight to her message Dey Cookie say Miss Meade done got wud early dis mawnin dat young Mist Phil done been shot an Miss Meade she tuck de cahige an Ole Talbot an Betsy an dey done gone ter fotch him home Cookie say he bad hurt an Miss Meade ain gwine ter be studyin bout comin up hyah Scarlett stared at her and had an impulse to shake her Negroes were always so proud of being the bearers of evil tidings Well dont stand there like a ninny Go down to Mrs Merriwethers and ask her to come up or send her mammy Now hurry Dey ain dar Miss Scarlett Ah drapped in ter pass time of de day wid Mammy on mah way home Deys done gone House all locked up Spec deys at de horsepittle So thats where you were so long Whenever I send you somewhere you go where I tell you and dont stop to pass any time with anybody Go She stopped and racked her brain Who was left in town among their friends who would be helpful There was Mrs Elsing Of course Mrs Elsing didnt like her at all these days but she had always been fond of Melanie Go to Mrs Elsings and explain everything very carefully and ten her to please come up here And Prissy listen to me Miss Mellys baby is due and she may need you any minute now Now you hurry right straight back Yasm said Prissy and turning sauntered down the walk at snails gait Hurry you slow poke Yasm Prissy quickened her gait infinitesimally and Scarlett went back into the house She hesitated again before going upstairs to Melanie She would have to explain to her just why Mrs Meade couldnt come and the knowledge that Phil Meade was badly wounded might upset her Well shed tell a lie about it She entered Melanies room and saw that the breakfast tray was untouched Melanie lay on her side her face white  Page    Gone With The Wind Mrs Meades over at the hospital said Scarlett But Mrs Rising is coming Do you feel bad Not very lied Melanie Scarlett how long did it take Wade to get born Less than no time answered Scarlett with a cheerfulness she was far from feeling I was out in the yard and I didnt hardly have time to get into the house Mammy said it was scandalousjust like one of the darkies I hope Ill be like one of the darkies too said Melanie mustering a smile which suddenly disappeared as pain contorted her face Scarlett looked down at Melanies tiny hips with none too sanguine hopes but said reassuringly Oh its not really so bad Oh I know it isnt Im afraid Im a little coward Isis Mrs Elsing coming right away Yes right away said Scarlett Ill go down and get some fresh water and sponge you off Its so hot today She took as long a time as possible in getting the water running to the front door every two minutes to see if Prissy were coming There was no sign of Prissy so she went back upstairs sponged Melanies perspiring body and combed out her long dark hair When an hour had passed she heard scuffing negro feet coming down the street and looking out of the window saw Prissy returning slowly switching herself as before and tossing her head with as many airy affectations as if she had a large and interested audience Some day Im going to take a strap to that little wench thought Scarlett savagely hurrying down the stairs to meet her Miss Elsing ober at de horsepittle Dey Cookie lows a whole lot of wounded sojers come in on de early train Cookie fixin soup ter tek over dar She say Never mind what she said interrupted Scarlett her heart sinking Put on a clean apron because I want you to go over to the hospital Im going to give you a note to Dr Meade and if he isnt there give it to Dr Jones or any of the other doctors And if you dont hurry back this time Ill skin you alive Yasm And ask any of the gentlemen for news of the fighting If they dont know go by the depot and ask the engineers who brought the wounded in Ask if they are fighting at Jonesboro or near there Gawdlmighty Miss Scarlett and sudden fright was in Prissys black face De Yankees ain at Tara is dey I dont know Im telling you to ask for news Gawdlmighty Miss Scarlett Whutll dey do ter Maw Prissy began to bawl suddenly loudly the sound adding to Scarletts own uneasiness Stop bawling Miss Melanie will hear you Now go change your apron quick Spurred to speed Prissy hurried toward the back of the house while Scarlett scratched a hasty note on the margin of Geralds last letter to herthe only bit of paper in the house As she folded it so that her note was uppermost she caught Geralds words Your mothertyphoidunder no conditionto come home She almost sobbed If it wasnt for Melanie shed start home right this minute if she had to walk every step of the way Prissy went off at a trot the letter gripped in her hand and Scarlett went back upstairs trying to think of some plausible lie to explain Mrs Elsings failure to appear But Melanie asked no questions She lay upon her back her face tranquil and sweet and the sight of her quieted Scarlett for a while She sat down and tried to talk of inconsequential things but the thoughts of Tara and a possible defeat by the Yankees prodded cruelly She thought of Ellen dying and of the Yankees coming into Atlanta burning everything killing everybody Through it all the dull faroff thundering persisted rolling into her ears in waves of fear Finally she could not talk at all and only stared out of the window at the hot still street and the dusty leaves hanging motionless on the trees Melanie was silent too but at intervals her quiet face was wrenched with pain She said after each pain It wasnt very bad really and Scarlett knew she was lying She would have preferred a loud scream to silent endurance She knew she should feel sorry for Melanie but somehow she could not muster a spark of sympathy Her mind was too torn with her own anguish Once she looked sharply at the paintwisted face and wondered why it should be that she of all people in the world should be here with Melanie at this particular timeshe who had nothing in common with her who hated her who would gladly have seen her dead Well maybe shed have her wish and before the day was over too A cold superstitious fear swept her at this thought It was bad luck to wish that someone were dead almost as bad luck as to curse someone Curses came home to roost Mammy said She hastily prayed that Melanie wouldnt die and broke into feverish small talk hardly aware of what she said At last Melanie put a hot hand on her wrist Dont bother about talking dear I know how worried you are Im so sorry Im so much trouble Scarlett relapsed into silence but she could not sit still What would she do if neither the doctor nor Prissy got there in time She walked to the window and looked down the street and came back and sat down again Then she rose and looked out of the window on the other side of the room An hour went by and then another Noon came and the sun was high and hot and not a breath of air stirred the dusty leaves Melanies pains were harder now Her long hair was drenched in sweat and her gown stuck in wet spots to her body Scarlett sponged her face in silence but fear was gnawing at her God in Heaven suppose the baby came before the doctor arrived What would she do She knew less than nothing of midwifery This was exactly the emergency she had been dreading for weeks She had been counting on Prissy to handle the situation if no doctor should be available Prissy knew all about midwifery Shed said so time and again But where was Prissy Why didnt she come Why didnt the doctor come She went to the window and looked again She listened hard and suddenly she wondered if it were only her imagination or if the sound of cannon in the distance had died away If it were farther away it would mean that the fighting was nearer Jonesboro and that would mean At last she saw Prissy coming down the street at a quick trot and she leaned out of the window Prissy looking up saw her and her mouth opened to yell Seeing the panic written on the little black face and fearing she might alarm Melanie by crying out evil tidings Scarlett hastily put her finger to her lips and left the window Ill get some cooler water she said looking down into Melanies dark deepcircled eyes and trying to smile Then she  Page    Gone With The Wind hastily left the room closing the door carefully behind her Prissy was sitting on the bottom step in the hall panting Deys fightin at Jonesboro Miss Scarlett Dey say our gempmums is gittin beat Oh Gawd Miss Scarlett Whutll happen ter Maw an Poke Oh Gawd Miss Scarlett Whutll happen ter us effen de Yankees gits hyah Oh Gawd Scarlett clapped a hand over the blubbery mouth For Gods sake hush Yes what would happen to them if the Yankees camewhat would happen to Tara She pushed the thought firmly back into her mind and grappled with the more pressing emergency If she thought of these things shed begin to scream and bawl like Prissy Wheres Dr Meade Whens he coming Ah ain nebber seed him Miss Scarlett What Nom he ain at de horsepittle Miss Merriwether an Miss Elsing ain dar needer A man he tole me de doctah down by de car shed wid the wounded sojers jes come in frum Jonesboro but Miss Scarlett Ah wuz sceered ter go down dar ter de

Yasm Wipe your eyes and get a fresh pitcher of water and go on up Sponge her off Tell her Ive gone for Dr Meade Is her time nigh Miss Scarlett I dont know Im afraid it is but I dont know You should know Go on up Scarlett caught up her wide straw bonnet from the console table and jammed it on her head She looked in the mirror and automatically pushed up loose strands of hair but she did not see her own reflection Cold little ripples of fear that started in the pit of her stomach were radiating outward until the fingers that touched her cheeks were cold though the rest of her body streamed perspiration She hurried out of the house and into the heat of the sun It was blindingly glaring hot and as she hurried down Peachtree Street her temples began to throb from the heat From far down the street she could hear the rise and fall and roar of many voices By the time she caught sight of the Leyden house she was beginning to pant for her stays were tightly laced but she did not slow her gait The roar of noise grew louder From the Leyden house down to Five Points the street seethed with activity the activity of an anthill just destroyed Negroes were running up and down the street panic in their faces and on porches white children sat crying untended The street was crowded with army wagons and ambulances filled with wounded and carriages piled high with valises and pieces of furniture Men on horseback dashed out of side streets pellmell down Peachtree toward Hoods headquarters In front of the Bonnell house old Amos stood holding the head of the carriage horse and he greeted Scarlett with rolling eyes Aint you gone yit Miss Scarlett We is goin now Ole Miss packin her bag Going Where Gawd knows Miss Somewheres De Yankees is comin She hurried on not even saying goodby The Yankees were coming At Wesley Chapel she paused to catch her breath and wait for her hammering heart to subside If she did not quiet herself she would certainly faint As she stood clutching a lamp post for support she saw an officer on horseback come charging up the street from Five Points and on an impulse she ran out into the street and waved at him Oh stop Please stop He reined in so suddenly the horse went back on its haunches pawing the air There were harsh lines of fatigue and urgency in his face but his tattered gray hat was off with a sweep Madam Tell me is it true Are the Yankees coming Im afraid so Do you know so Yes Mam I know so A dispatch came in to headquarters half an hour ago from the fighting at Jonesboro At Jonesboro Are you sure Im sure Theres no use telling pretty lies Madam The message was from General Hardee and it said I have lost the battle and am in full retreat  Oh my God The dark face of the tired man looked down without emotion He gathered the reins again and put on his hat Oh sir please just a minute What shall we do Madam I cant say The army is evacuating Atlanta soon Going off and leaving us to the Yankees Im afraid so  Page    Gone With The Wind The spurred horse went off as though on springs and Scarlett was left standing in the middle of the street with the red dust thick upon her ankles The Yankees were coming The army was leaving The Yankees were coming What should she do Where should she run No she couldnt run There was Melanie back there in the bed expecting that baby Oh why did women have babies If it wasnt for Melanie she could take Wade and Prissy and hide in the woods where the Yankees could never find them But she couldnt take Melanie to the woods No not now Oh if shed only had the baby sooner yesterday even perhaps they could get an ambulance and take her away and hide her somewhere But nowshe must find Dr Meade and make him come home with her Perhaps he could hurry the baby She gathered up her skirts and ran down the street and the rhythm of her feet was The Yankees are coming The Yankees are coming Five Points was crowded with people who rushed here and there with unseeing eyes jammed with wagons ambulances ox carts carriages loaded with wounded A roaring sound like the breaking of surf rose from the crowd Then a strangely incongruous sight struck her eyes Throngs of women were coming up from the direction of the railroad tracks carrying hams across their shoulders Little children hurried by their sides staggering under buckets of steaming molasses Young boys dragged sacks of corn and potatoes One old man struggled along with a small barrel of flour on a wheelbarrow Men women and children black and white hurried hurried with straining faces lugging packages and sacks and boxes of foodmore food than she had seen in a year The crowd suddenly gave a lane for a careening carriage and through the lane came the frail and elegant Mrs Elsing standing up in the front of her victoria reins in one hand whip in the other She was hatless and white faced and her long gray hair streamed down her back as she lashed the horse like a Fury Jouncing on the back seat of the carriage was her black mammy Melissy clutching a greasy side of bacon to her with one hand while with the other and both feet she attempted to hold the boxes and bags piled all about her One bag of dried peas had burst and the peas strewed themselves into the street Scarlett screamed to her but the tumult of the crowd drowned her voice and the carriage rocked madly by For a moment she could not understand what it all meant and then remembering that the commissary warehouses were down by the railroad tracks she realized that the army had thrown them open to the people to salvage what they could before the Yankees came She pushed her way swiftly through the crowds past the packed hysterical mob surging in the open space of Five Points and hurried as fast as she could down the short block toward the depot Through the tangle of ambulances and the clouds of dust she could see doctors and stretcher bearers bending lifting hurrying Thank God shed find Dr Meade soon As she rounded the corner of the Atlanta Hotel and came in full view of the depot and the tracks she halted appalled Lying in the pitiless sun shoulder to shoulder head to feet were hundreds of wounded men lining the tracks the sidewalks stretched out in endless rows under the car shed Some lay stiff and still but many writhed under the hot sun moaning Everywhere swarms of flies hovered over the men crawling and buzzing in their faces everywhere was blood dirty bandages groans screamed curses of pain as stretcher bearers lifted men The smell of sweat of blood of unwashed bodies of excrement rose up in waves of blistering heat until the fetid stench almost nauseated her The ambulance men hurrying here and there among the prostrate forms frequently stepped on wounded men so thickly packed were the rows and those trodden upon stared stolidly up waiting their turn She shrank back clapping her hand to her mouth feeling that she was going to vomit She couldnt go on She had seen wounded men in the hospitals wounded men on Aunt Pittys lawn after the fighting at the creek but never anything like this Never anything like these stinking bleeding bodies broiling under the glaring sun This was an inferno of pain and smell and noise and hurryhurryhurry The Yankees are coming The Yankees are coming She braced her shoulders and went down among them straining her eyes among the upright figures to distinguish Dr Meade But she discovered she could not look for him for if she did not step carefully she would tread on some poor soldier She raised her skirts and tried to pick her way among them toward a knot of men who were directing the stretcher bearers As she walked feverish hands plucked at her skirt and voices croaked Ladywater Please lady water For Christs sake water Perspiration came down her face in streams as she pulled her skirts from clutching hands If she stepped on one of these men shed scream and faint She stepped over dead men over men who lay dull eyed with hands clutched to bellies where dried blood had glued torn uniforms to wounds over men whose beards were stiff with blood and from whose broken jaws came sounds which must mean Water Water If she did not find Dr Meade soon she would begin screaming with hysteria She looked toward the group of men under the car shed and cried as loudly as she could Dr Meade Is Dr Meade there From the group one man detached himself and looked toward her It was the doctor He was coatless and his sleeves were rolled up to his shoulders His shirt and trousers were as red as a butchers and even the end of his irongray beard was matted with blood His face was the face of a man drunk with fatigue and impotent rage and burning pity It was gray and dusty and sweat had streaked long rivulets across his cheeks But his voice was calm and decisive as he called to her Thank God you are here I can use every pair of hands For a moment she stared at him bewildered dropping her skirts in dismay They fell over the dirty face of a wounded man who feebly tried to turn his head to escape from their smothering folds What did the doctor mean The dust from the ambulances came into her face with choking dryness and the rotten smells were like a foul liquid in her nostrils Hurry child Come here She picked up her skirts and went to him as fast as she could go across the rows of bodies She put her hand on his arm and felt that it was trembling with weariness but there was no weakness in his face Oh Doctor she cried You must come Melanie is having her baby He looked at her as if her words did not register on his mind A man who lay upon the ground at her feet his head pillowed on his canteen grinned up companionably at her words  Page    Gone With The Wind They will do it he said cheerfully She did not even look down but shook the doctors arm Its Melanie The baby Doctor you must come She the This was no time for delicacy but it was hard to bring out the words with the ears of hundreds of strange men listening The pains are getting hard Please Doctor A baby Great God thundered the doctor and his face was suddenly contorted with hate and rage a rage not directed at her or at anyone except a world wherein such things could happen Are you crazy I cant leave these men They are dying hundreds of them I cant leave them for a damned baby Get some woman to help you Get my wife She opened her mouth to ten him why Mrs Meade could not come and then shut it abruptly He did not know his own son was wounded She wondered if he would still be here if he did know and something told her that even if Phil were dying he would still be standing on this spot giving aid to the many instead of the one No you must come Doctor You know you said shed have a hard time Was it really she Scarlett standing here saying these dreadful indelicate things at the top of her voice in this hell of heat and groans Shell die if you dont come He shook off her hand roughly and spoke as though he hardly heard her hardly knew what she said Die Yes theyll all dieall these men No bandages no salves no quinine no chloroform Oh God for some morphia Just a little morphia for the worst ones Just a little chloroform God damn the Yankees God damn the Yankees Give um hell Doctor said the man on the ground his teeth showing in his beard Scarlett began to shake and her eyes burned with tears of fright The doctor wasnt coming with her Melanie would die and she had wished that she would die The doctor wasnt coming Name of God Doctor Please Dr Meade bit his lip and his jaw hardened as his face went cool again Child Ill try I cant promise you But Ill try When we get these men tended to The Yankees are coming and the troops are moving out of town I dont know what theyll do with the wounded There arent any trains The Macon line has been captured  But Ill try Run along now Dont bother me Theres nothing much to bringing a baby Just tie up the cord  He turned as an orderly touched his arm and began firing directions and pointing to this and that wounded man The man at her feet looked up at Scarlett compassionately She turned away for the doctor had forgotten her She picked her way rapidly through the wounded and back to Peachtree Street The doctor wasnt coming She would have to see it through herself Thank God Prissy knew all about midwifery Her head ached from the heat and she could feel her basque soaking wet from perspiration sticking to her Her mind felt numb and so did her legs numb as in a nightmare when she tried to run and could not move them She thought of the long walk back to the house and it seemed interminable Then The Yankees are coming began to beat its refrain in her mind again Her heart began to pound and new life came into her limbs She hurried into the crowd at Five Points now so thick there was no room on the narrow sidewalks and she was forced to walk in the street Long lines of soldiers were passing dust covered sodden with weariness There seemed thousands of them bearded dirty their guns slung over their shoulders swiftly passing at route step Cannon rolled past the drivers flaying the thin mules with lengths of rawhide Commissary wagons with torn canvas covers rocked through the ruts Cavalry raising clouds of choking dust went past endlessly She had never seen so many soldiers together before Retreat Retreat The army was moving out The hurrying lines pushed her back onto the packed sidewalk and she smelled the reek of cheap corn whisky There were women in the mob near Decatur Street garishly dressed women whose bright finery and painted faces gave a discordant note of holiday Most of them were drunk and the soldiers on whose arms they hung were drunker She caught a fleeting glimpse of a head of red curls and saw that creature Belle Watling heard her shrill drunken laughter as she clung for support to a onearmed soldier who reeled and staggered When she had shoved and pushed her way through the mob for a block beyond Five Points the crowd thinned a little and gathering up her skirts she began to run again When she reached Wesley Chapel she was breathless and dizzy and sick at her stomach Her stays were cutting her ribs in two She sank down on the steps of the church and buried her head in her hands until she could breathe more easily If she could only get one deep breath way down in her abdomen If her heart would only stop bumping and drumming and cavorting If there were only someone in this mad place to whom she could turn Why she had never had to do a thing for herself in all her life There had always been someone to do things for her to look after her shelter and protect her and spoil her It was incredible that she could be in such a fix Not a friend not a neighbor to help her There had always been friends neighbors the competent hands of willing slaves And now in this hour of greatest need there was no one It was incredible that she could be so completely alone and frightened and far from home Home If she were only home Yankees or no Yankees Home even if Ellen was sick She longed for the sight of Ellens sweet face for Mammys strong arms around her She rose dizzily to her feet and started walking again When she came in sight of the house she saw Wade swinging on the front gate When he saw her his face puckered and he began to cry holding up a grubby bruised finger Hurt he sobbed Hurt Hush Hush Hush Or Ill spank you Go out in the back yard and make mud pies and dont move from there Wade hungwy he sobbed and put tin hurt finger in his mouth I dont care Go in the back yard and She looked up and saw Prissy leaning out of the upstairs window fright and worry written on her face but in an instant they were wiped away in relief as she saw her mistress Scarlett beckoned to her to come down and went into the house How cool it was in the hall She untied her bonnet and flung it on the table drawing her forearms across her wet forehead She heard the upstairs door open and a low wailing moan wrenched from the depths of agony came to her ears Prissy came down the stairs three at a time Is de doctah come No He cant come  Page    Gone With The Wind Gawd Miss Scarlett Miss Melly bad off The doctor cant come Nobody can come Youve got to bring the baby and Ill help you Prissys mouth fell open and her tongue wagged wordlessly She looked at Scarlett sideways and scuffed her feet and twisted her thin body Dont look so simple minded cried Scarlett infuriated at her silly expression Whats the matter Prissy edged back up the stairs Fo Gawd Miss Scarlett Fright and shame were in her rolling eyes Well Fo Gawd Miss Scarlett Wes got ter have a doctah AhAhMiss Scarlett Ah doan know nuthin bout bringin babies Maw wouldn nebber lemme be round folkses whut wuz havin dem All the breath went out of Scarletts lungs in one gasp of horror before rage swept her Prissy made a lunge past her bent on flight but Scarlett grabbed her You black liarwhat do you mean Youve been saying you knew everything about birthing babies What is the truth Tell me She shook her until the kinky head rocked drunkenly Ahs lyin Miss Scarlett Ah doan know huccome Ah tell sech a lie Ah jes see one baby birthed an Maw she lak ter wo me out fer watchin Scarlett glared at her and Prissy shrank back trying to pull loose For a moment her mind refused to accept the truth but when realization finally came to her that Prissy knew no more about midwifery than she did anger went over her like a flame She had never struck a slave in all her life but now she slapped the black cheek with all the force in her tired arm Prissy screamed at the top of her voice more from fright than pain and began to dance up and down writhing to break Scarletts grip As she screamed the moaning from the second floor ceased and a moment later Melanies voice weak and trembling called Scarlett Is it you Please come Please Scarlett dropped Prissys arm and the wench sank whimpering to the steps For a moment Scarlett stood still looking up listening to the low moaning which had begun again As she stood there it seemed as though a yoke descended heavily upon her neck felt as though a heavy load were harnessed to it a load she would feel as soon as she took a step She tried to think of all the things Mammy and Ellen had done for her when Wade was born but the merciful blurring of the childbirth pains obscured almost everything in mist She did recall a few things and she spoke to Prissy rapidly authority in her voice Build a fire in the stove and keep hot water boiling in the kettle And bring up all the towels you can find and that ball of twine And get me the scissors Dont come telling me you cant find them Get them and get them quick Now hurry She jerked Prissy to her feet and sent her kitchenwards with a shove Then she squared her shoulders and started up the stairs It was going to be difficult telling Melanie that she and Prissy were to deliver her baby CHAPTER XXII THERE WOULD NEVER AGAIN BE an afternoon as long as this one Or as hot Or as full of lazy insolent flies They swarmed on Melanie despite the fan Scarlett kept in constant motion Her arms ached from swinging the wide palmetto leaf All her efforts seemed futile for while she brushed them from Melanies moist face they crawled on her clammy feet and legs and made her jerk them weakly and cry Please On my feet The room was in semigloom for Scarlett had pulled down the shades to shut out the heat and brightness Pin points of sunlight came in through minute holes in the shades and about the edges The room was an oven and Scarletts sweatdrenched clothes never dried but became wetter and stickier as the hours went by Prissy was crouched in a corner sweating too and smelled so abominably Scarlett would have sent her from the room had she not feared the girl would take to her heels if once out of sight Melanie lay on the bed on a sheet dark with perspiration and splotched with dampness where Scarlett had spilled water She twisted endlessly to one side to the other to left to right and back again Sometimes she tried to sit up and fell back and began twisting again At first she had tried to keep from crying out biting her lips until they were raw and Scarlett whose nerves were as raw as the lips said huskily Melly for Gods sake dont try to be brave Yell if you want to Theres nobody to hear you but us As the afternoon wore on Melanie moaned whether she wanted to be brave or not and sometimes she screamed When she did Scarlett dropped her head into her hands and covered her ears and twisted her body and wished that she herself were dead Anything was preferable to being a helpless witness to such pain Anything was better than being tied here waiting for a baby that took such a long time coming Waiting when for all she knew the Yankees were actually at Five Points She fervently wished she had paid more attention to the whispered conversations of matrons on the subject of childbirth If only she had If only she had been more interested in such matters shed know whether Melanie was taking a long time or not She had a vague memory of one of Aunt Pittys stories of a friend who was in labor for two days and died without ever having the baby Suppose Melanie should go on like this for two days But Melanie was so delicate She couldnt stand two days of this pain Shed die soon if the baby didnt hurry And how could she ever face Ashley if he were still alive and tell him that Melanie had diedafter she had promised to take care of her At first Melanie wanted to hold Scarletts hand when the pain was bad but she clamped down on it so hard she nearly broke the bones After an hour of this Scarletts hands were so swollen and bruised she could hardly flex them She knotted two long towels together and tied them to the foot of the bed and put the knotted end in Melanies hands Melanie hung onto it as though it were a life line straining pulling it taut slackening it tearing it Throughout the afternoon her voice went on like an animal dying in a trap Occasionally she dropped the towel and rubbed her hands feebly and looked up at Scarlett with eyes enormous with pain Talk to me Please talk to me she whispered and Scarlett would gabble something until Melanie again gripped the knot and  Page    Gone With The Wind again began writhing The dim room swam with heat and pain and droning flies and time went by on such dragging feet Scarlett could scarcely remember the morning She felt as if she had been in this steaming dark sweating place all her life She wanted very much to scream every time Melanie did and only by biting her lips so hard it infuriated her could she restrain herself and drive off hysteria Once Wade came tiptoeing up the stairs and stood outside the door wailing Wade hungwy Scarlett started to go to him but Melanie whispered Dont leave me Please I can stand it when youre here So Scarlett sent Prissy down to warm up the breakfast hominy and feed him For herself she felt that she could never eat again after this afternoon The clock on the mantel had stopped and she had no way of telling the time but as the heat in the room lessened and the bright pin points of light grew duller she pulled the shade aside She saw to her surprise that it was late afternoon and the sun a ball of crimson was far down the sky Somehow she had imagined it would remain broiling hot noon forever She wondered passionately what was going on downtown Had all the troops moved out yet Had the Yankees come Would the Confederates march away without even a fight Then she remembered with a sick dropping in her stomach how few Confederates there were and how many men Sherman had and how well fed they were Sherman The name of Satan himself did not frightened her half so much But there was no time for thinking now as Melanie called for water for a cold towel on her head to be fanned to have the flies brushed away from her face When twilight came on and Prissy scurrying like a black wraith lit a lamp Melanie became weaker She began calling for Ashley over and over as if in a delirium until the hideous monotony gave Scarlett a fierce desire to smother her voice with a pillow Perhaps the doctor would come after all If he would only come quickly Hope raising its head she turned to Prissy and ordered her to run quickly to the Meades house and see if he were there or Mrs Meade And if hes not there ask Mrs Meade or Cookie what to do Beg them to come Prissy was off with a clatter and Scarlett watched her hurrying down the street going faster than she had ever dreamed the worthless child could move After a prolonged time she was back alone De doctah ain been home all day Sont wud he mout go off wid de sojers Miss Scarlett Mist Phils ceased Dead Yasm said Prissy expanding with importance Talbot dey coachman tole me He wuz shot Never mind that Ah din see Miss Meade Cookie say Miss Meade she washin him an fixin ter buhy him fo de Yankees gits hyah Cookie say effen de pain get too bad jes you put a knife unner Miss Mellys bed an it cut de pain in two Scarlett wanted to slap her again for this helpful information but Melanie opened wide dilated eyes and whispered Dearare the Yankees coming No said Scarlett stoutly Prissys a liar Yasm Ah sho is Prissy agreed fervently Theyre coming whispered Melanie undeceived and buried her face in the pillow Her voice came out muffled My poor baby My poor baby And after a long interval Oh Scarlett you mustnt stay here You must go and take Wade What Melanie said was no more than Scarlett had been thinking but hearing it put into words infuriated her shamed her as if her secret cowardice was written plainly in her face Dont be a goose Im not afraid You know I wont leave you You might as well Im going to die And she began moaning again Scarlett came down the dark stairs slowly like an old woman feeling her way clinging to the banisters lest she fall Her legs were leaden trembling with fatigue and strain and she shivered with cold from the clammy sweat that soaked her body Feebly she made her way onto the front porch and sank down on the top step She sprawled back against a pillar of the porch and with a shaking hand unbuttoned her basque halfway down her bosom The night was drenched in warm soft darkness and she lay staring into it dull as an ox It was all over Melanie was not dead and the small baby boy who made noises like a young kitten was receiving his first bath at Prissys hands Melanie was asleep How could she sleep after that nightmare of screaming pain and ignorant midwifery that hurt more than it helped Why wasnt she dead Scarlett knew that she herself would have died under such handling But when it was over Melanie had even whispered so weakly she had to bend over her to hear Thank you And then she had gone to sleep How could she go to sleep Scarlett forgot that she too had gone to sleep after Wade was born She forgot everything Her mind was a vacuum the world was a vacuum there had been no life before this endless day and there would be none hereafteronly a heavily hot night only the sound of her hoarse tired breathing only the sweat trickling coldly from armpit to waist from hip to knee clammy sticky chilling She heard her own breath pass from loud evenness to spasmodic sobbing but her eyes were dry and burning as though there would never be tears in them again Slowly laboriously she heaved herself over and pulled her heavy skirts up to her thighs She was warm and cold and sticky all at the same time and the feel of the night air on her limbs was refreshing She thought dully what Aunt Pitty would say if she could see her sprawled here on the front porch with her skirts up and her drawers showing but she did not care She did not care about anything Time had stood still It might be just after twilight and it might be midnight She didnt know or care She heard sounds of moving feet upstairs and thought May the Lord damn Prissy before her eyes closed and something like sleep descended upon her Then after an indeterminate dark interval Prissy was beside her chattering on in a pleased way We done right good Miss Scarlett Ah specs Maw couldn a did no better From the shadows Scarlett glared at her too tired to rail too tired to upbraid too tired to enumerate Prissys offensesher  Page    Gone With The Wind boastful assumption of experience she didnt possess her fright her blundering awkwardness her utter inefficiency when the emergency was hot the misplacing of the scissors the spilling of the basin of water on the bed the dropping of the new born baby And now she bragged about how good she had been And the Yankees wanted to free the negroes Well the Yankees were welcome to them She lay back against the pillar in silence and Prissy aware of her mood tiptoed away into the darkness of the porch After a long interval in which her breathing finally quieted and her mind steadied Scarlett heard the sound of faint voices from up the road the tramping of many feet coming from the north Soldiers She sat up slowly pulling down her skirts although she knew no one could see her in the darkness As they came abreast the house an indeterminate number passing like shadows she called to them Oh please A shadow disengaged itself from the mass and came to the gate Are you going Are you leaving us The shadow seemed to take off a hat and a quiet voice came from the darkness Yes Mam Thats what were doing Were the last of the men from the breastworks bout a mile north from here Are youis the army really retreating Yes Mam You see the Yankees are coming The Yankees are coming She had forgotten that Her throat suddenly contracted and she could say nothing more The shadow moved away merged itself with the other shadows and the feet tramped off into the darkness The Yankees are coming The Yankees are coming That was what the rhythm of their feet said that was what her suddenly bumping heart thudded out with each beat The Yankees are coming De Yankees is comin bawled Prissy shrinking close to her Oh Miss Scarlett deyll kill us all Deyll run dey baynits in our stummicks Deyll Oh hush It was terrifying enough to think these things without hearing them put into trembling words Renewed fear swept her What could she do How could she escape Where could she turn for help Every friend had failed her Suddenly she thought of Rhett Butler and calm dispelled her fears Why hadnt she thought of him this morning when she had been tearing about like a chicken with its head off She hated him but he was strong and smart and he wasnt afraid of the Yankees And he was still in town Of course she was mad at him But she could overlook such things at a time like this And he had a horse and carriage too Oh why hadnt she thought of him before He could take them all away from this doomed place away from the Yankees somewhere anywhere She turned to Prissy and spoke with feverish urgency You know where Captain Butler livesat the Atlanta Hotel Yasm but Well go there now as quick as you can run and tell him I want him I want him to come quickly and bring his horse and carriage or an ambulance if he can get one Tell him about the baby Tell him I want him to take us out of here Go now Hurry She sat upright and gave Prissy a push to speed her feet Gawdlmighty Miss Scarlett Ahs sceered ter go runnin roun in de dahk by mahseff Spose de Yankees gits me If you run fast you can catch up with those soldiers and they wont let the Yankees get you Hurry Ahs sceered Sposin Capn Butler ain at de hotel Then ask where he is Havent you any gumption If he isnt at the hotel go to the barrooms on Decatur Street and ask for him Go to Belle Watlings house Hunt for him You fool dont you see that if you dont hurry and find him the Yankees will surely get us all Miss Scarlett Maw would weah me out wid a cotton stalk did Ah go in a bahroom or a ho house Scarlett pulled herself to her feet Well Ill wear you out if you dont You can stand outside in the street and yell for him cant you Or ask somebody if hes inside Get going When Prissy still lingered shuffling her feet and mouthing Scarlett gave her another push which nearly sent her headlong down the front steps Youll go or Ill sell you down the river Youll never see your mother again or anybody you know and Ill sell you for a field hand too Hurry Gawdlmighty Miss Scarlett But under the determined pressure of her mistress hand she started down the steps The front gate clicked and Scarlett cried Run you goose She heard the patter of Prissys feet as she broke into a trot and then the sound died away on the soft earth CHAPTER XXIII AFTER PRISSY HAD GONE Scarlett went wearily into the downstairs hall and lit a lamp The house felt steamingly hot as though it held in its walls all the heat of the noontide Some of her dullness was passing now and her stomach was clamoring for food She remembered she had had nothing to eat since the night before except a spoonful of hominy and picking up the lamp she went into the kitchen The fire in the oven had died but the room was stifling hot She found half a pone of hard corn bread in the skillet and gnawed hungrily on it while she looked about for other food There was some hominy left in the pot and she ate it with a big cooking spoon not waiting to put it on a plate It needed salt badly but she was too hungry to hunt for it After four spoonfuls of it the heat of the room was too much and taking the lamp in one hand and a fragment of pone in the other she went out into the hall She knew she should go upstairs and sit beside Melanie If anything went wrong Melanie would be too weak to call But the  Page    Gone With The Wind idea of returning to that room where she had spent so many nightmare hours was repulsive to her Even if Melanie were dying she couldnt go back up there She never wanted to see that room again She set the lamp on the candle stand by the window and returned to the front porch It was so much cooler here and even the night was drowned in soft warmth She sat down on the steps in the circle of faint light thrown by the lamp and continued gnawing on the corn bread When she had finished it a measure of strength came back to her and with the strength came again the pricking of fear She could hear a humming of noise far down the street but what it portended she did not know She could distinguish nothing but a volume of sound that rose and fell She strained forward trying to hear and soon she found her muscles aching from the tension More than anything in the world she yearned to hear the sound of hooves and to see Rhetts careless selfconfident eyes laughing at her fears Rhett would take them away somewhere She didnt know where She didnt care As she sat straining her ears toward town a faint glow appeared above the trees It puzzled her She watched it and saw it grow brighter The dark sky became pink and then dull red and suddenly above the trees she saw a huge tongue of flame leap high to the heavens She jumped to her feet her heart beginning again its sickening thudding and bumping The Yankees had come She knew they had come and they were burning the town The flames seemed to be off to the east of the center of town They shot higher and higher and widened rapidly into a broad expanse of red before her terrified eyes A whole block must be burning A faint hot breeze that had sprung up bore the smell of smoke to her She fled up the stairs to her own room and hung out the window for a better view The sky was a hideous lurid color and great swirls of black smoke went twisting up to hand in billowy clouds above the flames The smell of smoke was stronger now Her mind rushed incoherently here and there thinking how soon the flames would spread up Peachtree Street and burn this house how soon the Yankees would be rushing in upon her where she would run what she would do All the fiends of hell seemed screaming in her ears and her brain swirled with confusion and panic so overpowering she clung to the window sill for support I must think she told herself over and over I must think But thoughts eluded her darting in and out of her mind like frightened humming birds As she stood hanging to the sill a deafening explosion burst on her ears louder than any cannon she had ever heard The sky was rent with gigantic flame Then other explosions The earth shook and the glass in the panes above her head shivered and came down around her The world became an inferno of noise and flame and trembling earth as one explosion followed another in earsplitting succession Torrents of sparks shot to the sky and descended slowly lazily through bloodcolored clouds of smoke She thought she heard a feeble call from the next room but she paid it no heed She had no time for Melanie now No time for anything except a fear that licked through her veins as swiftly as the flames she saw She was a child and mad with fright and she wanted to bury her head in her mothers lap and shut out this sight If she were only home Home with Mother Through the nerveshivering sounds she heard another sound that of fearsped feet coming up the stairs three at a time heard a voice yelping like a lost hound Prissy broke into the room and flying to Scarlett clutched her arm in a grip that seemed to pinch out pieces of flesh The Yankees cried Scarlett Nom its our gempmums yelled Prissy between breaths digging her nails deeper into Scarletts arm Deys buhnin de founry an de ahmy supply depots an de wahouses an fo Gawd Miss Scarlett dey done set off dem sebenty freight cahs of cannon balls an gunpowder an Jesus wes all gwine ter buhn up She began yelping again shrilly and pinched Scarlett so hard she cried out in pain and fury and shook off her hand The Yankees hadnt come yet There was still time to get away She rallied her frightened forces together If I dont get a hold on myself she thought Ill be squalling like a scalded cat and the sight of Prissys abject terror helped steady her She took her by the shoulders and shook her Shut up that racket and talk sense The Yankees havent come you fool Did you see Captain Butler What did he say Is he coming Prissy ceased her yelling but her teeth chattered Yasm Ah finely foun him In a bahroom lak you told me He Never mind where you found him Is he coming Did you tell him to bring his horse Lawd Miss Scarlett he say our gempmums done tuck his hawse an cahige fer a amberlance Dear God in Heaven But he comin What did he say Prissy had recovered her breath and a small measure of control but her eyes still rolled Wellm lak you tole me Ah foun him in a bahroom Ah stood outside an yell fer him an he come out An terreckly he see me an Ah starts tell him de sojers tech off a sto house down Decatur Street an it flame up an he say Come on an he grab me an we runs ter Fibe Points an he say den What now Talk fas An Ah say you say Capn Butler come quick an

hyah an wants him ter go wid you An he laugh an say dey done tuck his hawse Scarletts heart went leaden as the last hope left her Fool that she was why hadnt she thought that the retreating army would naturally take every vehicle and animal left in the city For a moment she was too stunned to hear what Prissy was saying but she pulled herself together to hear the rest of the story An den he say Tell Miss Scarlett ter res easy Ahll steal her a hawse outer de ahmy crall effen deys ary one lef An he say Ah done stole hawses befo dis night Tell her Ah git her a hawse effen Ah gits shot fer it Den he laugh agin an say Cut an run home An befo Ah gits started Kerbloom Off goes a noise an Ah lak ter drap in mah tracks an he tell me twarnt nuthin but de ammernition our gempmums blowin up sos de Yankees dont git it an He is coming Hes going to bring a horse So he say  Page    Gone With The Wind She drew a long breath of relief If there was any way of getting a horse Rhett Butler would get one A smart man Rhett She would forgive him anything if he got them out of this mess Escape And with Rhett she would have no fear Rhett would protect them Thank God for Rhett With safety in view she turned practical Wake Wade up and dress him and pack some clothes for an of us Put them in the small trunk And dont tell Miss Mellie were going Not yet But wrap the baby in a couple of thick towels and be sure and pack his clothes Prissy still dang to her skirts and hardly anything showed in her eyes except the whites Scarlett gave her a shove and loosened her grip Hurry she cried and Prissy went off like a rabbit Scarlett knew she should go in and quiet Melanies fear knew Melanie must be frightened out of her senses by the thunderous noises that continued unabated and the glare that lighted the sky It looked and sounded like the end of the world But she could not bring herself to go back into that room just yet She ran down the stairs with some idea of packing up Miss Pittypats china and the little silver she had left when she refugeed to Macon But when she reached the dining room her hands were shaking so badly she dropped three plates and shattered them She ran out onto the porch to listen and back again to the dining room and dropped the silver clattering to the floor Everything she touched she dropped In her hurry she slipped on the rag rug and fell to the floor with a jolt but leaped up so quickly she was not even aware of the pain Upstairs she could hear Prissy galloping about like a wild animal and the sound maddened her for she was galloping just as aimlessly For the dozenth time she ran out onto the porch but this time she did not go back to her futile packing She sat down It was just impossible to pack anything Impossible to do anything but sit with hammering heart and wait for Rhett It seemed hours before he came At last far up the road she heard the protesting screech of unoiled axles and the slow uncertain plodding of hooves Why didnt he hurry Why didnt he make the horse trot The sounds came nearer and she leaped to her feet and called Rhetts name Then she saw him dimly as he climbed down from the seat of a small wagon heard the clicking of the gate as he came toward her He came into view and the light of the lamp showed him plainly His dress was as debonair as if he were going to a ball welltailored white linen coat and trousers embroidered gray wateredsilk waistcoat and a hint of ruffle on his shirt bosom His wide Panama hat was set dashingly on one side of his head and in the belt of his trousers were thrust two ivoryhandled longbarreled dueling pistols The pockets of his coat sagged heavily with ammunition He came up the walk with the springy stride of a savage and his fine head was carried like a pagan prince The dangers of the night which had driven Scarlett into panic had affected him like an intoxicant There was a carefully restrained ferocity in his dark face a ruthlessness which would have frightened her had she the wits to see it His black eyes danced as though amused by the whole affair as though the earthsplitting sounds and the horrid glare were merely things to frighten children She swayed toward him as he came up the steps her face white her green eyes burning Good evening he said in his drawling voice as he removed his hat with a sweeping gesture Fine weather were having I hear youre going to take a trip If you make any jokes I shall never speak to you again she said with quivering voice Dont tell me you are frightened He pretended to be surprised and smiled in a way that made her long to push him backwards down the steep steps Yes I am Im frightened to death and if you had the sense God gave a goat youd be frightened too But we havent got time to talk We must get out of here At your service Madam But just where were you figuring on going I made the trip out here for curiosity just to see where you were intending to go You cant go north or east or south or west The Yankees are all around Theres just one road out of town which the Yankees havent got yet and the army is retreating by that road And that road wont be open long General Steve Lees cavalry is fighting a rearguard action at Rough and Ready to hold it open long enough for the army to get away If you follow the army down the McDonough road theyll take the horse away from you and while its not much of a horse I did go to a lot of trouble stealing it Just where are you going She stood shaking listening to his words hardly hearing them But at his question she suddenly knew where she was going knew that all this miserable day she had known where she was going The only place Im going home she said Home You mean to Tara Yes yes To Tara Oh Rhett we must hurry He looked at her as if she had lost her mind Tara God Almighty Scarlett Dont you know they fought all day at Jonesboro Fought for ten miles up and down the road from Rough and Ready even into the streets of Jonesboro The Yankees may be all over Tara by now all over the County Nobody knows where they are but theyre in that neighborhood You cant go home You cant go right through the Yankee army I will go home she cried I will I will You little fool and his voice was swift and rough You cant go that way Even if you didnt run into the Yankees the woods are full of stragglers and deserters from both armies And lots of our troops are still retreating from Jonesboro Theyd take the horse away from you as quickly as the Yankees would Your only chance is to follow the troops down the McDonough road and pray that they wont see you in the dark You cant go to Tara Even if you got there youd probably find it burned down I wont let you go home Its insanity I will go home she cried and her voice broke and rose to a scream I will go home You cant stop me I will go home I want my mother Ill kill you if you try to stop me I will go home Tears of fright and hysteria streamed down her face as she finally gave way under the long strain She beat on his chest with her fists and screamed again I will I will If I have to walk every step of the way Suddenly she was in his arms her wet cheek against the starched ruffle of his shirt her beating hands stilled against him His  Page    Gone With The Wind hands caressed her tumbled hair gently soothingly and his voice was gentle too So gentle so quiet so devoid of mockery it did not seem Rhett Butlers voice at all but the voice of some kind strong stranger who smelled of brandy and tobacco and horses comforting smells because they reminded her of Gerald There there darling he said softly Dont cry You shall go home my brave little girl You shall go home Dont cry She felt something brush her hair and wondered vaguely through her tumult if it were his lips He was so tender so infinitely soothing she longed to stay in his arms forever With such strong arms about her surely nothing could harm her He fumbled in his pocket and produced a handkerchief and wiped her eyes Now blow your nose like a good child he ordered a glint of a smile in his eyes and tell me what to do We must work fast She blew her nose obediently still trembling but she could not think what to tell him to do Seeing how her lip quivered and her eyes looked up at him helplessly he took command Mrs Wilkes has had her child It will be dangerous to move herdangerous to drive her twentyfive miles in that rickety wagon Wed better leave her with Mrs Meade The Meades arent home I cant leave her Very well Into the wagon she goes Where is that simpleminded little wench Upstairs packing the trunk Trunk You cant take any trunk in that wagon Its almost too small to hold all of you and the wheels are ready to come off with no encouragement Call her and tell her to get the smallest feather bed in the house and put it in the wagon Still Scarlett could not move He took her arm in a strong grasp and some of the vitality which animated him seemed to flow into her body If only she could be as cool and casual as he was He propelled her into the hall but she still stood helplessly looking at him His lip went down mockingly Can this be the heroic young woman who assured me she feared neither God nor man He suddenly burst into laughter and dropped her arm Stung she glared at him hating him Im not afraid she said Yes you are In another moment youll be in a swoon and I have no smelling salts about me She stamped her foot impotently because she could not think of anything else to doand without a word picked up the lamp and started up the stairs He was close behind her and she could hear him laughing softly to himself That sound stiffened her spine She went into Wades nursery and found him sitting clutched in Prissys arms half dressed hiccoughing quietly Prissy was whimpering The feather tick on Wades bed was small and she ordered Prissy to drag it down the stairs and into the wagon Prissy put down the child and obeyed Wade followed her down the stairs his hiccoughs stilled by his interest in the proceedings Come said Scarlett turning to Melanies door and Rhett followed her hat in hand Melanie lay quietly with the sheet up to her chin Her face was deathly white but her eyes sunken and black circled were serene She showed no surprise at the sight of Rhett in her bedroom but seemed to take it as a matter of course She tried to smile weakly but the smile died before it reached the corners of her mouth We are going home to Tara Scarlett explained rapidly The Yankees are coming Rhett is going to take us Its the only way Melly Melanie tried to nod her head feebly and gestured toward the baby Scarlett picked up the small baby and wrapped him hastily in a thick towel Rhett stepped to the bed Ill try not to hurt you he said quietly tucking the sheet about her See if you can put your arms around my neck Melanie tried but they fell back weakly He bent slipped an arm under her shoulders and another across her knees and lifted her gently She did not cry out but Scarlett saw her bite her lip and go even whiter Scarlett held the lamp high for Rhett to see and started toward the door when Melanie made a feeble gesture toward the wall What is it Rhett asked softly Please Melanie whispered trying to point Charles Rhett looked down at her as if he thought her delirious but Scarlett understood and was irritated She knew Melanie wanted the daguerreotype of Charles which hung on the wall below his sword and pistol Please Melanie whispered again the sword Oh all right said Scarlett and after she had lighted Rhetts careful way down the steps she went back and unhooked the sword and pistol belts It would be awkward carrying them as well as the baby and the lamp That was just like Melanie not to be at all bothered over nearly dying and having the Yankees at her heels but to worry about Charles things As she took down the daguerreotype she caught a glimpse of Charles face His large brown eyes met hers and she stopped for a moment to look at the picture curiously This man had been her husband had lain beside her for a few nights had given her a child with eyes as soft and brown as his And she could hardly remember him The child in her arms waved small fists and mewed softly and she looked down at him For the first time she realized that this was Ashleys baby and suddenly wished with all the strength left in her that he were her baby hers and Ashleys Prissy came bounding up the stairs and Scarlett handed the child to her They went hastily down the lamp throwing uncertain shadows on the wall In the hall Scarlett saw a bonnet and put it on hurriedly tying the ribbons under her chin It was Melanies black mourning bonnet and it did not fit Scarletts head but she could not recall where she had put her own bonnet She went out of the house and down the front steps carrying the lamp and trying to keep the saber from banging against her legs Melanie lay full length in the back of the wagon and beside her were Wade and the towelswathed baby Prissy climbed in and took the baby in her arms The wagon was very small and the boards about the sides very low The wheels leaned inward as if their first revolution would make them come off She took one look at the horse and her heart sank He was a small emaciated animal and he stood with his head dispiritedly low almost between his forelegs His back was raw with sores and harness galls and he breathed as no sound horse should  Page    Gone With The Wind Not much of an animal is it grinned Rhett Looks like hell die in the shafts But hes the best I could do Some day Ill tell you with embellishments just where and how I stole him and how narrowly I missed getting shot Nothing but my devotion to you would make me at this stage of my career turn horse thiefand thief of such a horse Let me help you in He took the lamp from her and set it on the ground The front seat was only a narrow plank across the sides of the wagon Rhett picked Scarlett up bodily and swung her to it How wonderful to be a man and as strong as Rhett she thought tucking her wide skirts about her With Rhett beside her she did not fear anything neither the fire nor the noise nor the Yankees He climbed onto the seat beside her and picked up the reins Oh wait she cried I forgot to lock the front door He burst into a roar of laughter and slapped the reins upon the horses back What are you laughing at At youlocking the Yankees out he said and the horse started off slowly reluctantly The lamp on the sidewalk burned on making a tiny yellow circle of light which grew smaller and smaller as they moved away Rhett turned the horses slow feet westward from Peachtree and the wobbling wagon jounced into the rutty lane with a violence that wrenched an abruptly stilled moan from Melanie Dark trees interlaced above their heads dark silent houses loomed up on either side and the white palings of fences gleamed faintly like a row of tombstones The narrow street was a dim tunnel but faintly through the thick leafy ceiling the hideous red glow of the sky penetrated and shadows chased one another down the dark way like mad ghosts The smell of smoke came stronger and stronger and on the wings of the hot breeze came a pandemonium of sound from the center of town yells the dull rumbling of heavy army wagons and the steady tramp of marching feet As Rhett jerked the horses head and turned him into another street another deafening explosion tore the air and a monstrous skyrocket of flame and smoke shot up in the west That must be the last of the ammunition trains Rhett said calmly Why didnt they get them out this morning the fools There was plenty of time Well too bad for us I thought by circling around the center of town we might avoid the fire and that drunken mob on Decatur Street and get through to the southwest part of town without any danger But weve got to cross Marietta Street somewhere and that explosion was near Marietta Street or I miss my guess Mustmust we go through the fire Scarlett quavered Not if we hurry said Rhett and springing from the wagon he disappeared into the darkness of a yard When he returned he had a small limb of a tree in his hand and he laid it mercilessly across the horses galled back The animal broke into a shambling trot his breath panting and labored and the wagon swayed forward with a jolt that threw them about like popcorn in a popper The baby wailed and Prissy and Wade cried out as they bruised themselves against the sides of the wagon But from Melanie there was no sound As they neared Marietta Street the trees thinned out and the tall flames roaring up above the buildings threw street and houses into a glare of light brighter than day casting monstrous shadows that twisted as wildly as torn sails flapping in a gale on a sinking ship Scarletts teeth chattered but so great was her terror she was not even aware of it She was cold and she shivered even though the heat of the flames was already hot against their faces This was hell and she was in it and if she could only have conquered her shaking knees she would have leaped from the wagon and run screaming back the dark road they had come back to the refuge of Miss Pittypats house She shrank closer to Rhett took his arm in fingers that trembled and looked up at him for words for comfort for something reassuring In the unholy crimson glow that bathed them his dark profile stood out as clearly as the head on an ancient coin beautiful cruel and decadent At her touch he turned to her his eyes gleaming with a light as frightening as the fire To Scarlett he seemed as exhilarated and contemptuous as if he got strong pleasure from the situation as if he welcomed the inferno they were approaching Here he said laying a hand on one of the longbarreled pistols in his belt If anyone black or white comes up on your side of the wagon and tries to lay hand on the horse shoot him and well ask questions later But for Gods sake dont shoot the nag in your excitement II have a pistol she whispered clutching the weapon in her lap perfectly certain that if death stared her in the face she would be too frightened to pull the trigger You have Where did you get it Its Charles Charles Yes Charlesmy husband Did you ever really have a husband my dear he whispered and laughed softly If he would only be serious If he would only hurry How do you suppose I got my boy she cried fiercely Oh there are other ways than husbands Will you hush and hurry But he drew rein abruptly almost at Marietta Street in the shadow of a warehouse not yet touched by the flames Hurry It was the only word in her mind Hurry Hurry Soldiers he said The detachment came down Marietta Street between the burning buildings walking at route step tiredly rifles held any way heads down too weary to hurry too weary to care if timbers were crashing to right and left and smoke billowing about them They were all ragged so ragged that between officers and men there were no distinguishing insignia except here and there a torn hat brim pinned up with a wreathed CSA Many were barefooted and here and there a dirty bandage wrapped a head or arm They went past looking neither to left nor right so silent that had it not been for the steady tramp of feet they might all have been ghosts  Page    Gone With The Wind Take a good look at them came Rhetts gibing voice so you can tell your grandchildren you saw the rear guard of the Glorious Cause in retreat Suddenly she hated him hated him with a strength that momentarily overpowered her fear made it seem petty and small She knew her safety and that of the others in the back of the wagon depended on him and him alone but she hated him for his sneering at those ragged ranks She thought of Charles who was dead and Ashley who might be dead and all the gay and gallant young men who were rotting in shallow graves and she forgot that she too had once thought them fools She could not speak but hatred and disgust burned in her eyes as she stared at him fiercely As the last of the soldiers were passing a small figure in the rear rank his rifle butt dragging the ground wavered stopped and stared after the others with a dirty face so dulled by fatigue he looked like a sleepwalker He was as small as Scarlett so small his rifle was almost as tall as he was and his grimesmeared face was unbearded Sixteen at the most thought Scarlett irrelevantly must be one of the Home Guard or a runaway schoolboy As she watched the boys knees buckled slowly and he went down in the dust Without a word two men fell out of the last rank and walked back to him One a tall spare man with a black beard that hung to his belt silently handed his own rifle and that of the boy to the other Then stooping he jerked the boy to his shoulders with an ease that looked like sleight of hand He started off slowly after the retreating column his shoulders bowed under the weight while the boy weak infuriated like a child teased by its elders screamed out Put me down damn you Put me down I can walk The bearded man said nothing and plodded on out of sight around the bend of the road Rhett sat still the reins lax in his hands looking after them a curious moody look on his swarthy face Then there was a crash of falling timbers near by and Scarlett saw a thin tongue of flame lick up over the roof of the warehouse in whose sheltering shadow they sat Then pennons and battle flags of flame flared triumphantly to the sky above them Smoke burnt her nostrils and Wade and Prissy began coughing The baby made soft sneezing sounds Oh name of God Rhett Are you crazy Hurry Hurry Rhett made no reply but brought the tree limb down on the horses back with a cruel force that made the animal leap forward With all the speed the horse could summon they jolted and bounced across Marietta Street Ahead of them was a tunnel of fire where buildings were blaring on either side of the short narrow street that led down to the railroad tracks They plunged into it A glare brighter than a dozen suns dazzled their eyes scorching heat seared their skins and the roaring crackling and crashing beat upon their ears in painful waves For an eternity it seemed they were in the midst of flaming torment and then abruptly they were in semidarkness again As they dashed down the street and bumped over the railroad tracks Rhett applied the whip automatically His face looked set and absent as though he had forgotten where he was His broad shoulders were hunched forward and his chin jutted out as though the thoughts in his mind were not pleasant The heat of the fire made sweat stream down his forehead and cheeks but he did not wipe it off They pulled into a side street then another then turned and twisted from one narrow street to another until Scarlett completely lost her bearings and the roaring of the flames died behind them Still Rhett did not speak He only laid on the whip with regularity The red glow in the sky was fading now and the road became so dark so frightening Scarlett would have welcomed words any words from him even jeering insulting words words that cut But he did not speak Silent or not she thanked Heaven for the comfort of his presence It was so good to have a man beside her to lean close to him and feel the hard swell of his arm and know that he stood between her and unnamable terrors even though he merely sat there and stared Oh Rhett she whispered clasping his arm What would we ever have done without you Im so glad you arent in the army He turned his head and gave her one look a look that made her drop his arm and shrink back There was no mockery in his eyes now They were naked and there was anger and something like bewilderment in them His lip curled down and he turned his head away For a long time they jounced along in a silence unbroken except for the faint wails of the baby and sniffles from Prissy When she was able to bear the sniffling noise no longer Scarlett turned and pinched her viciously causing Prissy to scream in good earnest before she relapsed into frightened silence Finally Rhett turned the horse at right angles and after a while they were on a wider smoother road The dim shapes of houses grew farther and farther apart and unbroken woods loomed walllike on either side Were out of town now said Rhett briefly drawing rein and on the main road to Rough and Ready Hurry Dont stop Let the animal breathe a bit Then turning to her he asked slowly Scarlett are you still determined to do this crazy thing Do what Do you still want to try to get through to Tara Its suicidal Steve Lees cavalry and the Yankee Army are between you and Tara Oh Dear God Was he going to refuse to take her home after all shed gone through this terrible day Oh yes Yes Please Rhett lets hurry The horse isnt tired Just a minute You cant go down to Jonesboro on this road You cant follow the train tracks Theyve been fighting up and down mere all day from Rough and Ready on south Do you know any other roads small wagon roads or lanes that dont go through Rough and Ready or Jonesboro Oh yes cried Scarlett in relief If we can just get near to Rough and Ready I know a wagon trace that winds off from the main Jonesboro road and wanders around for miles Pa and I used to ride it It comes out right near the Macintosh place and thats only a mile from Tara Good Maybe you can get past Rough and Ready all right General Steve Lee was there during the afternoon covering the retreat Maybe the Yankees arent there yet Maybe you can get through there if Steve Lees men dont pick up your horse  I can get through  Page    Gone With The Wind Yes you  His voice was rough But Rhett YouArent going to take us No Im leaving you here She looked around wildly at the livid sky behind them at the dark trees on either hand hemming them in like a prison wall at the frightened figures in the back of the wagonand finally at him Had she gone crazy Was she not hearing right He was grinning now She could just see his white teeth in the faint light and the old mockery was back in his eyes Leaving us Wherewhere are you going I am going dear girl with the army She sighed with relief and irritation Why did he joke at this time of all times Rhett in the army After all hed said about stupid fools who were enticed into losing their lives by a roll of drums and brave words from oratorsfools who killed themselves that wise men might make money Oh I could choke you for scaring me so Lets get on Im not joking my dear And I am hurt Scarlett that you do not take my gallant sacrifice with better spirit Where is your patriotism your love for Our Glorious Cause Now is your chance to tell me to return with my shield or on it But talk fast for I want time to make a brave speech before departing for the wars His drawling voice gibed in her ears He was jeering at her and somehow she knew he was jeering at himself too What was he talking about Patriotism shields brave speeches It wasnt possible that he meant what he was saying It just wasnt believable that he could talk so blithely of leaving her here on this dark road with a woman who might be dying a newborn infant a foolish black wench and a frightened child leaving her to pilot them through miles of battle fields and stragglers and Yankees and fire and God knows what Once when she was six years old she had fallen from a tree flat on her stomach She could still recall that sickening interval before breath came back into her body Now as she looked at Rhett she felt the same way she had felt then breathless stunned nauseated Rhett you are joking She grabbed his arm and felt her tears of fright splash down her wrist He raised her hand and kissed it arily Selfish to the end arent you my dear Thinking only of your own precious hide and not of the gallant Confederacy Think how our troops will be heartened by my eleventhhour appearance There was a malicious tenderness in his voice Oh Rhett she wailed how can you do this to me Why are you leaving me Why he laughed jauntily Because perhaps of the betraying sentimentality that lurks in all of us Southerners Perhapsperhaps because I am ashamed Who knows Ashamed You should die of shame To desert us here alone helpless Dear Scarlett You arent helpless Anyone as selfish and determined as you are is never helpless God help the Yankees if they should get you He stepped abruptly down from the wagon and as she watched him stunned with bewilderment he came around to her side of the wagon Get out he ordered She stared at him He reached up roughly caught her under the arms and swung her to the ground beside him With a tight grip on her he dragged her several paces away from the wagon She felt the dust and gravel in her slippers hurting her feet The still hot darkness wrapped her like a dream Im not asking you to understand or forgive I dont give a damn whether you do either for I shall never understand or forgive myself for this idiocy I am annoyed at myself to find that so much quixoticism still lingers in me But our fair Southland needs every man Didnt our brave Governor Brown say just that Not matter Im off to the wars He laughed suddenly a ringing free laugh that startled the echoes in the dark woods  I could not love thee Dear so much loved I not Honour more Thats a pat speech isnt it Certainly better than anything I can think up myself at the present moment For I do love you Scarlett in spite of what I said that night on the porch last month His drawl was caressing and his hands slid tip her bare arms warm strong hands I love you Scarlett because we are so much alike renegades both of us dear and selfish rascals Neither of us cares a rap if the whole world goes to pot so long as we are safe and comfortable His voice went on in the darkness and she heard words but they made no sense to her Her mind was tiredly trying to take in the harsh truth that he was leaving her here to face the Yankees alone Her mind said Hes leaving me Hes leaving me But no emotion stirred Then his arms went around her waist and shoulders and she felt the hard muscles of his thighs against her body and the buttons of his coat pressing into her breast A warm tide of feeling bewildering frightening swept over her carrying out of her mind the time and place and circumstances She felt as limp as a rag doll warm weak and helpless and his supporting arms were so pleasant You dont want to change your mind about what I said last month Theres nothing like danger and death to give an added fillip Be patriotic Scarlett Think how you would be sending a soldier to his death with beautiful memories He was kissing her now and his mustache tickled her mouth kissing her with slow hot lips that were so leisurely as though he had the whole night before him Charles had never kissed her like this Never had the kisses of the Tarleton and Calvert boys made her go hot and cold and shaky like this He bent her body backward and his lips traveled down her throat to where the cameo fastened her basque Sweet he whispered Sweet She saw the wagon dimly in the dark and heard the treble piping of Wades voice Muvver Wade fwightened  Page    Gone With The Wind Into her swaying darkened mind cold sanity came back with a rush and she remembered what she had forgotten for the momentthat she was frightened too and Rhett was leaving her leaving her the damned cad And on top of it all he had the consummate gall to stand here in the road and insult her with his infamous proposals Rage and hate flowed into her and stiffened her spine and with one wrench she tore herself loose from his arms Oh you cad she cried and her mind leaped about trying to think of worse things to call him things she had heard Gerald call Mr Lincoln the Macintoshes and balky mules but the words would not come You lowdown cowardly nasty stinking thing And because she could not think of anything crushing enough she drew back her arm and slapped him across the mouth with all the force she had left He took a step backward his hand going to his face Ah he said quietly and for a moment they stood facing each other in the darkness Scarlett could hear his heavy breathing and her own breath came in gasps as if she had been running hard They were right Everybody was right You arent a gentleman My dear girl he said how inadequate She knew he was laughing and the thought goaded her Go on Go on now I want you to hurry I dont want to ever see you again I hope a cannon ball lands right on you I hope it blows you to a million pieces I Never mind the rest I follow your general idea When Im dead on the altar of my country I hope your conscience hurts you She heard him laugh as he turned away and walked back toward the wagon She saw him stand beside it heard him speak and his voice was changed courteous and respectful as it always was when he spoke to Melanie Mrs Wilkes Prissys frightened voice made answer from the wagon Gawdlmighty Capn Butler Miss Melly done fainted away back yonder Shes not dead Is she breathing Yassuh she breathin Then shes probably better off as she is If she were conscious I doubt if she could live through all the pain Take good care of her Prissy Heres a shinplaster for you Try not to be a bigger fool than you are Yassuh Thankee suh Goodby Scarlett She knew he had turned and was facing her but she did not speak Hate choked all utterance His feet ground on the pebbles of the road and for a moment she saw his big shoulders looming up in the dark Then he was gone She could hear the sound of his feet for a while and then they died away She came slowly back to the wagon her knees shaking Why had he gone stepping off into the dark into the war into a Cause that was lost into a world that was mad Why had he gone Rhett who loved the pleasures of women and liquor the comfort of good food and soft beds the feel of fine linen and good leather who hated the South and jeered at the fools who fought for it Now he had set his varnished boots upon a bitter road where hunger tramped with tireless stride and wounds and weariness and heartbreak ran like yelping wolves And the end of the road was death He need not have gone He was safe rich comfortable But he had gone leaving her alone in a night as black as blindness with the Yankee Army between her and home Now she remembered all the bad names she had wanted to call him but it was too late She leaned her head against the bowed neck of the horse and cried CHAPTER XXIV THE BRIGHT GLARE of morning sunlight streaming through the trees overhead awakened Scarlett For a moment stiffened by the cramped position in which she had slept she could not remember where she was The sun blinded her the hard boards of the wagon under her were harsh against her body and a heavy weight lay across her legs She tried to sit up and discovered that the weight was Wade who lay sleeping with his head pillowed on her knees Melanies bare feet were almost in her face and under the wagon seat Prissy was curled up like a black cat with the small baby wedged in between her and Wade Then she remembered everything She popped up to a sitting position and looked hastily all around Thank God no Yankees in sight Their hiding place had not been discovered in the night It all came back to her now the nightmare journey after Rhetts footsteps died away the endless night the black road full of ruts and boulders along which they jolted the deep gullies on either side into which the wagon slipped the fearcrazed strength with which she and Prissy had pushed the wheels out of the gullies She recalled with a shudder how often she had driven the unwilling horse into fields and woods when she heard soldiers approaching not knowing if they were friends or foesrecalled too her anguish lest a cough a sneeze or Wades hiccoughing might betray them to the marching men Oh that dark road where men went by like ghosts voices stilled only the muffled tramping of feet on soft dirt the faint clicking of bridles and the straining creak of leather And oh that dreadful moment when the sick horse balked and cavalry and light cannon rumbled past in the darkness past where they sat breathless so close she could almost reach out and touch them so close she could smell the stale sweat on the soldiers bodies When at last they had neared Rough and Ready a few camp fires were gleaming where the last of Steve Lees rear guard was awaiting orders to fall back She had circled through a plowed field for a mile until the light of the fires died out behind her And then she had lost her way in the darkness and sobbed when she could not find the little wagon path she knew so well Then finally having found it the horse sank in the traces and refused to move refused to rise even when she and Prissy tugged at the bridle So she had unharnessed him and crawled sodden with fatigue into the back of the wagon and stretched her aching legs She had a faint memory of Melanies voice before sleep clamped down her eyelids a weak voice that apologized even as it begged Scarlett can I have some water please She had said There isnt any and gone to sleep before the words were out of her mouth  Page    Gone With The Wind Now it was morning and the world was still and serene and green and gold with dappled sunshine And no soldiers in sight anywhere She was hungry and dry with thirst aching and cramped and filled with wonder that she Scarlett OHara who could never rest well except between linen sheets and on the softest of feather beds had slept like a field hand on hard planks Blinking in the sunlight her eyes fell on Melanie and she gasped horrified Melanie lay so still and white Scarlett thought she must be dead She looked dead She looked like a dead old woman with her ravaged face and her dark hair snarled and tangled across it Then Scarlett saw with relief the faint rise and fall of her shallow breathing and knew that Melanie had survived the night Scarlett shaded her eyes with her hand and looked about her They had evidently spent the night under the trees in someones front yard for a sand and gravel driveway stretched out before her winding away under an avenue of cedars Why its the Mallory place she thought her heart leaping with gladness at the thought of friends and help But a stillness as of death hung over the plantation The shrubs and grass of the lawn were cut to pieces where hooves and wheels and feet had torn frantically back and forth until the soil was churned up She looked toward the house and instead of the old white clapboard place she knew so well she saw there only a long rectangle of blackened granite foundation stones and two tall chimneys rearing smokestained bricks into the charred leaves of still trees She drew a deep shuddering breath Would she find Tara like this level with the ground silent as the dead I mustnt think about that now she told herself hurriedly I mustnt let myself think about it Ill get scared again if I think about it But in spite of herself her heart quickened and each beat seemed to thunder Home Hurry Home Hurry They must be starting on toward home again But first they must find some food and water especially water She prodded Prissy awake Prissy rolled her eyes as she looked about her Fo Gawd Miss Scarlett Ah din spec ter wake up agin cept in de Promise Lan Youre a long way from there said Scarlett trying to smooth back her untidy hair Her face was damp and her body was already wet with sweat She felt dirty and messy and sticky almost as if she smelled bad Her clothes were crushed and wrinkled from sleeping in them and she had never felt more acutely tired and sore in all her life Muscles she did not know she possessed ached from her unaccustomed exertions of the night before and every movement brought sharp pain She looked down at Melanie and saw that her dark eyes were opened They were sick eyes fever bright and dark baggy circles were beneath them She opened cracking lips and whispered appealingly Water Get up Prissy ordered Scarlett Well go to the well and get some water But Miss Scarlett Dey mout be hants up dar Sposin somebody daid up dar Ill make a hant out of you if you dont get out of this wagon said Scarlett who was in no mood for argument as she climbed lamely down to the ground And then she thought of the horse Name of God Suppose the horse had died in the night He had seemed ready to die when she unharnessed him She ran around the wagon and saw him lying on his side If he were dead she would curse God and die too Somebody in the Bible had done just that thing Cursed God and died She knew just how that person felt But the horse was alivebreathing heavily sick eyes half closed but alive Well some water would help him too Prissy climbed reluctantly from the wagon with many groans and timorously followed Scarlett up the avenue Behind the ruins the row of whitewashed slave quarters stood silent and deserted under the overhanging trees Between the quarters and the smoked stone foundations they found the well and the roof of it still stood with the bucket far down the well Between them they wound up the rope and when the bucket of cool sparkling water appeared out of the dark depths Scarlett tilted it to her lips and drank with loud sucking noises spilling the water all over herself She drank until Prissys petulant Well Ahs thusty too Miss Scarlett made her recall the needs of the others Untie the knot and take the bucket to the wagon and give them some And give the rest to the horse Dont you think Miss Melanie ought to nurse the baby Hell starve Law Miss Scarlett Miss Melly ain got no milkain gwine have none How do you know Ahs seed too many lak her Dont go putting on any airs with me A precious little you knew about babies yesterday Hurry now Im going to try to find something to eat Scarletts search was futile until in the orchard she found a few apples Soldiers had been there before her and there was none on the trees Those she found on the ground were mostly rotten She filled her skirt with the best of them and came back across the soft earth collecting small pebbles in her slippers Why hadnt she thought of putting on stouter shoes last night Why hadnt she brought her sun hat Why hadnt she brought something to eat Shed acted like a fool But of course shed thought Rhett would take care of them Rhett She spat on the ground for the very name tasted bad How she hated him How contemptible he had been And she had stood there in the road and let him kiss herand almost liked it She had been crazy last night How despicable he was When she came back she divided up the apples and threw the rest into the back of the wagon The horse was on his feet now but the water did not seem to have refreshed him much He looked far worse in the daylight than he had the night before His hip bones stood out like an old cows his ribs showed like a washboard and his back was a mass of sores She shrank from touching him as she harnessed him When she slipped the bit into his mouth she saw that he was practically toothless As old as the hills While Rhett was stealing a horse why couldnt he have stolen a good one She mounted the seat and brought down the hickory limb on his back He wheezed and started but he walked so slowly as she turned him into the road she knew she could walk faster herself with no effort whatever Oh if only she didnt have Melanie and Wade and the baby and Prissy to bother with How swiftly she could walk home Why she would run home run every step of the way that would bring her closer to Tara and to Mother They couldnt be more than fifteen miles from home but at the rate this old nag traveled it would take all day for she would have to stop frequently to rest him All day She looked down the glaring red road cut in deep ruts where cannon wheels and  Page    Gone With The Wind ambulances had gone over it It would be hours before she knew if Tara still stood and if Ellen were there It would be hours before she finished her journey under the broiling September sun She looked back at Melanie who lay with sick eyes closed against the sun and jerked loose the strings of her bonnet and tossed it to Prissy Put that over her face Itll keep the sun out of her eyes Then as the heat beat down upon her unprotected head she thought Ill be as freckled as a guinea egg before this day is over She had never in her life been out in the sunshine without a hat or veils never handled reins without gloves to protect the white skin of her dimpled hands Yet here she was exposed to the sun in a brokendown wagon with a brokendown horse dirty sweaty hungry helpless to do anything but plod along at a snails pace through a deserted land What a few short weeks it had been since she was safe and secure What a little while since she and everyone else had thought that Atlanta could never fall that Georgia could never be invaded But the small cloud which appeared in the northwest four months ago had blown up into a mighty storm and men into a screaming tornado sweeping away her world whirling her out of her sheltered life and dropping her down in the midst of this still haunted desolation Was Tara still standing Or was Tara also gone with the wind which had swept through Georgia She laid the whip on the tired horses back and tried to urge him on while the waggling wheels rocked them drunkenly from side to side  There was death in the air In the rays of the late afternoon sun every wellremembered field and forest grove was green and still with an unearthly quiet that struck terror to Scarletts heart Every empty shellpitted house they had passed that day every gaunt chimney standing sentinel over smokeblackened ruins had frightened her more They had not seen a living human being or animal since the night before Dead men and dead horses yes and dead mules lying by the road swollen covered with flies but nothing alive No faroff cattle lowed no birds sang no wind waved the trees Only the tired plopplop of the horses feet and the weak wailing of Melanies baby broke the stillness The countryside lay as under some dread enchantment Or worse still thought Scarlett with a chill like the familiar and dear face of a mother beautiful and quiet at last after death agonies She felt that the oncefamiliar woods were full of ghosts Thousands had died in the fighting near Jonesboro They were here in these haunted woods where the slanting afternoon sun gleamed eerily through unmoving leaves friends and foes peering at her in her rickety wagon through eyes blinded with blood and red dustglazed horrible eyes Mother Mother she whispered If she could only win to Ellen If only by a miracle of God Tara were still standing and she could drive up the long avenue of trees and go into the house and see her mothers kind tender face could feel once more the soft capable hands that drove out fear could clutch Ellens skirts and bury her face in them Mother would know what to do She wouldnt let Melanie and her baby die She would drive away all ghosts and fears with her quiet Hush hush But Mother was ill perhaps dying Scarlett laid the whip across the weary rump of the horse They must go faster They had crept along this neverending road all the long hot day Soon it would be night and they would be alone in this desolation that was death She gripped the reins tighter with hands that were blistered and slapped them fiercely on the horses back her aching arms burning at the movement If she could only reach the kind arms of Tara and Ellen and lay down her burdens far too heavy for her young shouldersthe dying woman the fading baby her own hungry little boy the frightened negro all looking to her for strength for guidance all reading in her straight back courage she did not possess and strength which had long since failed The exhausted horse did not respond to the whip or reins but shambled on dragging his feet stumbling on small rocks and swaying as if ready to fall to his knees But as twilight came they at last entered the final lap of the long journey They rounded the bend of the wagon path and turned into the main road Tara was only a mile away Here loomed up the dark bulk of the mockorange hedge that marked the beginning of the Macintosh property A little farther on Scarlett drew rein in front of the avenue of oaks that led from the road to old Angus Macintoshs house She peered through the gathering dusk down the two lines of ancient trees All was dark Not a single light showed in the house or in the quarters Straining her eyes in the darkness she dimly discerned a sight which had grown familiar through that terrible daytwo tall chimneys like gigantic tombstones towering above the ruined second floor and broken unlit windows blotching the walls like still blind eyes Hello she shouted summoning all her strength Hello Prissy clawed at her in a frenzy of fright and Scarlett turning saw that her eyes were rolling in her head Doan holler Miss Scarlett Please doan holler agin she whispered her voice shaking Dey ain no tellin whut mout answer Dear God thought Scarlett a shiver running through her Dear God Shes right Anything might come out of there She flapped the reins and urged the horse forward The sight of the Macintosh house had pricked the last bubble of hope remaining to her It was burned in rums deserted as were all the plantations she had passed that day Tara lay only half a mite away on the same road right in the path of the army Tara was leveled too She would find only the blackened bricks starlight shining through the roofless walls Ellen and Gerald gone the girls gone Mammy gone the negroes gone God knows where and this hideous stillness over everything Why had she come on this fools errand against all common sense dragging Melanie and her child Better that they had died in Atlanta than tortured by this day of burning sun and jolting wagon to die in the silent ruins of Tara But Ashley had left Melanie in her care Take care of her Oh that beautiful heartbreaking day when he had kissed her goodby before he went away forever Youll take care of her wont you Promise And she had promised Why had she ever bound herself with such a promise doubly binding now that Ashley was gone Even in her exhaustion she hated Melanie hated the tiny mewing voice of her child which fainter and fainter pierced the stillness But she had promised and now they belonged to her even as Wade and Prissy belonged to her and she must struggle and fight for them as long as she had strength or breath  Page    Gone With The Wind She could have left them in Atlanta dumped Melanie into the hospital and deserted her But had she done that she could never face Ashley either on this earth or in the hereafter and tell him she had left his wife and child to die among strangers Oh Ashley Where was he tonight while she toiled down this haunted road with his wife and baby Was he alive and did he think of her as he lay behind the bars at Rock Island Or was he dead of smallpox months ago rotting in some long ditch with hundreds of other Confederates Scarletts taut nerves almost cracked as a sudden noise sounded in the underbrush near them Prissy screamed loudly throwing herself to the floor of the wagon the baby beneath her Melanie stirred feebly her hands seeking the baby and Wade covered his eyes and cowered too frightened to cry Then the bushes beside them crashed apart under heavy hooves and a low moaning bawl assaulted their ears Its only a cow said Scarlett her voice rough with fright Dont be a fool Prissy Youve mashed the baby and frightened Miss Melly and Wade Its a ghos moaned Prissy writhing face down on the wagon boards Turning deliberately Scarlett raised the tree limb she had been using as a whip and brought it down across Prissys back She was too exhausted and weak from fright to tolerate weakness in anyone else Sit up you fool she said before I wear this out on you Yelping Prissy raised her head and peering over the side of the wagon saw it was indeed a cow a red and white animal which stood looking at them appealingly with large frightened eyes Opening its mouth it lowed again as if in pain Is it hurt That doesnt sound like an ordinary moo Soun ter me lak her bag full an she need milkin bad said Prissy regaining some measure of control Spec it one of Mist Macintoshs dat de niggers driv in de woods an de Yankees din git Well take it with us Scarlett decided swiftly Then we can have some milk for the baby How all we gwine tek a cow wid us Miss Scarlett We kain tek no cow wid us Cow ain no good nohow effen she ain been milked lately Dey bags swells up and busts Dats why she hollerin Since you know so much about it take off your petticoat and tear it up and tie her to the back of the wagon Miss Scarlett you knows Ah ain had no petticoat fer a month an did Ah have one Ah wouldn put it on her fer nuthin Ah nebber had no truck wid cows Ahs sceered of cows Scarlett laid down the reins and pulled up her skirt The lacetrimmed petticoat beneath was the last garment she possessed that was prettyand whole She untied the waist tape and slipped it down over her feet crushing the soft linen folds between her hands Rhett had brought her that linen and lace from Nassau on the last boat he slipped through the blockade and she had worked a week to make the garment Resolutely she took it by the hem and jerked put it in her mouth and gnawed until finally the material gave with a rip and tore the length She gnawed furiously tore with both hands and the petticoat lay in strips in her hands She knotted the ends with fingers that bled from blisters and shook from fatigue Slip this over her horns she directed But Prissy balked Ahs sceered of cows Miss Scarlett Ah ain nebber had nuthin ter do wid cows Ah ain no yard nigger Ahs a house nigger Youre a fool nigger and the worst days work Pa ever did was to buy you said Scarlett slowly too tired for anger And if I ever get the use of my arm again Ill wear this whip out on you There she thought Ive said nigger and Mother wouldnt like that at all Prissy rolled her eyes wildly peeping first at the set face of her mistress and then at the cow which bawled plaintively Scarlett seemed the less dangerous of the two so Prissy clutched at the sides of the wagon and remained where she was Stiffly Scarlett climbed down from the seat each movement of agony of aching muscles Prissy was not the only one who was sceered of cows Scarlett had always feared them even the mildest cow seemed sinister to her but this was no time to truckle to small fears when great ones crowded so thick upon her Fortunately the cow was gentle In its pain it had sought human companionship and help and it made no threatening gesture as she looped one end of the torn petticoat about its horns She tied the other end to the back of the wagon as securely as her awkward fingers would permit Then as she started back toward the drivers seat a vast weariness assailed her and she swayed dizzily She clutched the side of the wagon to keep from falling Melanie opened her eyes and seeing Scarlett standing beside her whispered Dearare we home Home Hot tears came to Scarletts eyes at the word Home Melanie did not know there was no home and that they were alone in a mad and desolate world Not yet she said as gently as the constriction of her throat would permit but we will be soon Ive just found a cow and soon well have some milk for you and the baby Poor baby whispered Melanie her hand creeping feebly toward the child and falling short Climbing back into the wagon required all the strength Scarlett could muster but at last it was done and she picked up the lines The horse stood with head drooping dejectedly and refused to start Scarlett laid on the whip mercilessly She hoped God would forgive her for hurting a tired animal If He didnt she was sorry After all Tara lay just ahead and after the next quarter of a mile the horse could drop in the shafts if he liked Finally he started slowly the wagon creaking and the cow lowing mournfully at every step The pained animals voice rasped on Scarletts nerves until she was tempted to stop and untie the beast What good would the cow do them anyway if there should be no one at Tara She couldnt milk her and even if she could the animal would probably kick anyone who touched her sore udder But she had the cow and she might as well keep her There was little else she had in this world now Scarletts eyes grew misty when at last they reached the bottom of a gentle incline for just over the rise lay Tara Then her heart sank The decrepit animal would never pull the hill The slope had always seemed so slight so gradual in days when she galloped up it on her fleetfooted mare It did not seem possible it could have grown so steep since she saw it last The horse would never make it with the heavy load Wearily she dismounted and took the animal by the bridle  Page    Gone With The Wind Get out Prissy she commanded and take Wade Either carry him or make him walk Lay the baby by Miss Melanie Wade broke into sobs and whimperings from which Scarlett could only distinguish Darkdark Wade fwightened Miss Scarlett Ah kain walk Mah feets done blistered an deys thoo mah shoes an Wade an me doan weigh so much an Get out Get out before I pull you out And if I do Im going to leave you right here in the dark by yourself Quick now  Prissy moaned peering at the dark trees that closed about them on both sides of the roadtrees which might reach out and clutch her if she left the shelter of the wagon But she laid the baby beside Melanie scrambled to the ground and reaching up lifted Wade out The little boy sobbed shrinking close to his nurse Make him hush I cant stand it said Scarlett taking the horse by the bridle and pulling him to a reluctant start Be a little man Wade and stop crying or I will come over there and slap you Why had God invented children she thought savagely as she turned her ankle cruelly on the dark roaduseless crying nuisances they were always demanding care always in the way In her exhaustion there was no room for compassion for the frightened child trotting by Prissys side dragging at her hand and snifflingonly a weariness that she had borne him only a tired wonder that she had ever married Charles Hamilton Miss Scarlett whispered Prissy clutching her mistress arm doan les go ter Tara Deys not dar Deys all done gone Maybe dey daidMaw an allm The echo of her own thoughts infuriated her and Scarlett shook off the pinching fingers Then give me Wades hand You can sit right down here and stay Nom Nom Then hush How slowly the horse moved The moisture from his slobbering mouth dripped down upon her hand Through her mind ran a few words of the song she had once sung with Rhettshe could not recall the rest Just a few more days for to tote the weary load Just a few more steps hummed her brain over and over just a few more steps for to tote the weary load Then they topped the rise and before them lay the oaks of Tara a towering dark mass against the darkening sky Scarlett looked hastily to see if there was a light anywhere There was none They are gone said her heart like cold lead in her breast Gone She turned the horses head into the driveway and the cedars meeting over their heads cast them into midnight blackness Peering up the long tunnel of darkness straining her eyes she saw aheador did she see Were her tired eyes playing her tricksthe white bricks of Tara blurred and indistinct Home Home The dear white walls the windows with the fluttering curtains the wide verandaswere they all there ahead of her in the gloom Or did the darkness mercifully conceal such a horror as the Macintosh house The avenue seemed miles long and the horse pulling stubbornly at her hand plopped slower and slower Eagerly her eyes searched the darkness The roof seemed to be intact Could it becould it be No it wasnt possible War stopped for nothing not even Tara built to last five hundred years It could not have passed over Tara Then the shadowy outline did take form She pulled the horse forward faster The white walls did show there through the darkness And untarnished by smoke Tara had escaped Home She dropped the bridle and ran the last few steps leaped forward with an urge to clutch the walls themselves in her arms Then she saw a form shadowy in the dimness emerging from the blackness of the front veranda and standing at the top of the steps Tara was not deserted Someone was home A cry of joy rose to her throat and died there The house was so dark and still and the figure did not move or call to her What was wrong What was wrong Tara stood intact yet shrouded with the same eerie quiet that hung over the whole stricken countryside Then the figure moved Stiffly and slowly it came down the steps Pa she whispered huskily doubting almost that it was he Its meKatie Scarlett Ive come home Gerald moved toward her silent as a sleepwalker his stiff leg dragging He came close to her looking at her in a dazed way as if he believed she was part of a dream Putting out his hand he laid it on her shoulder Scarlett felt it tremble tremble as if he had been awakened from a nightmare into a halfsense of reality Daughter he said with an effort Daughter Then he was silent Whyhes an old man thought Scarlett Geralds shoulders sagged In the face which she could only see dimly there was none of the virility the restless vitality of Gerald and the eyes that looked into hers had almost the same fearstunned look that lay in little Wades eyes He was only a little old man and broken And now fear of unknown things seized her leaped swiftly out of the darkness at her and she could only stand and stare at him all the flood of questioning dammed up at her lips From the wagon the faint wailing sounded again and Gerald seemed to rouse himself with an effort Its Melanie and her baby whispered Scarlett rapidly Shes very illI brought her home Gerald dropped his hand from her arm and straightened his shoulders As he moved slowly to the side of the wagon there was a ghostly semblance of the old host of Tara welcoming guests as if Gerald spoke words from out of shadowy memory Cousin Melanie Melanies voice murmured indistinctly Cousin Melanie this is your home Twelve Oaks is burned You must stay with us Thoughts of Melanies prolonged suffering spurred Scarlett to action The present was with her again the necessity of laying Melanie and her child on a soft bed and doing those small things for her that could be done She must be carried She cant walk  Page    Gone With The Wind There was a scuffle of feet and a dark figure emerged from the cave of the front hall Pork ran down the steps Miss Scarlett Miss Scarlett he cried Scarlett caught him by the arms Pork part and parcel of Tara as dear as the bricks and the cool corridors She felt his tears stream down on her hands as he patted her clumsily crying Sho is glad you back Sho is Prissy burst into tears and incoherent mumblings Poke Poke honey And little Wade encouraged by the weakness of his elders began sniffling Wade thirsty Scarlett caught them all in hand Miss Melanie is in the wagon and her baby too Pork you must carry her upstairs very carefully and put her in the back company room Prissy take the baby and Wade inside and give Wade a drink of water Is Mammy here Pork Tell her I want her Galvanized by the authority in her voice Pork approached the wagon and fumbled at the backboard A moan was wrenched from Melanie as he halflifted halfdragged her from the feather tick on which she had lain so many hours And then she was in Porks strong arms her head drooping like a childs across his shoulder Prissy holding the baby and dragging Wade by the hand followed them up the wide steps and disappeared into the blackness of the hall Scarletts bleeding fingers sought her fathers hand urgently Did they get well Pa The girls are recovering Silence fell and in the silence an idea too monstrous for words took form She could not could not force it to her lips She swallowed and swallowed but a sudden dryness seemed to have stuck the sides of her throat together Was this the answer to the frightening riddle of Taras silence As if answering the question in her mind Gerald spoke Your mother he said and stopped AndMother Your mother died yesterday Her fathers arm held tightly in her own Scarlett felt her way down the wide dark hall which even in its blackness was as familiar as her own mind She avoided the highbacked chairs the empty gun rack the old sideboard with its protruding claw feet and she felt herself drawn by instinct to the tiny office at the back of the house where Ellen always sat keeping her endless accounts Surely when she entered that room Mother would again be sitting there before the secretary and would look up quill poised and rise with sweet fragrance and rustling hoops to meet her tired daughter Ellen could not be dead not even though Pa had said it said it over and over like a parrot that knows only one phrase She died yesterdayshe died yesterdayshe died yesterday Queer that she should feel nothing now nothing except a weariness that shackled her limbs with heavy iron chains and a hunger that made her knees tremble She would think of Mother later She must put her mother out of her mind now else she would stumble stupidly like Gerald or sob monotonously like Wade Pork came down the wide dark steps toward them hurrying to press close to Scarlett like a cold animal toward a fire Lights she questioned Why is the house so dark Pork Bring candles Dey tuck all de candles Miss Scarlett all cept one we been usin ter fine things in de dahk wid an its bout gone Mammy been usin a rag in a dish of hawg fat fer a light fer nussin Miss Careen an Miss Suellen Bring whats left of the candle she ordered Bring it into Mothersinto the office Pork pattered into the dining room and Scarlett groped her way into the inky small room and sank down on the sofa Her fathers arm still lay in the crook of hers helpless appealing trusting as only the hands of the very young and the very old can be Hes an old man an old tired man she thought again and vaguely wondered why she could not care Light wavered into the room as Pork entered carrying high a halfburned candle stuck in a saucer The dark cave came to life the sagging old sofa on which they sat the tall secretary reaching toward the ceiling with Mothers fragile carved chair before it the racks of pigeonholes still stuffed with papers written in her fine hand the worn carpetall all were the same except that Ellen was not there Ellen with the faint scent of lemon verbena sachet and the sweet look in her tiptilted eyes Scarlett felt a small pain in her heart as of nerves numbed by a deep wound struggling to make themselves felt again She must not let them come to life now there was all the rest of her life ahead of her in which they could ache But not now Please God not now She looked into Geralds puttycolored face and for the first time in her life she saw him unshaven his once florid face covered with silvery bristles Pork placed the candle on the candle stand and came to her side Scarlett felt that if he had been a dog he would have laid his muzzle in her lap and whined for a kind hand upon his head Pork how many darkies are here Miss Scarlett dem trashy niggers done runned away an some of dem went off wid de Yankees an How many are left Deys me Miss Scarlett an Mammy She been nussin de young Misses all day An Dilcey she settin up wid de young Misses now Us three Miss Scarlett Us three where there had been a hundred Scarlett with an effort lifted her head on her aching neck She knew she must keep her voice steady To her surprise words came out as coolly and naturally as if there had never been a war and she could by waving her hand call ten house servants to her Pork Im starving Is there anything to eat Nom Dey tuck it all But the garden Dey tuhned dey

PorkII feel so faint Is there any wine in the cellar even blackberry Oh Miss Scarlett de cellar wuz de fust place dey went A swimming nausea compounded of hunger sleeplessness exhaustion and stunning blows came on suddenly and she gripped the carved roses under her hand No wine she said dully remembering the endless rows of bottles in the cellar A memory stirred Pork what of the corn whisky Pa

Scarlett was left alone with Gerald She patted his leg gently She noted how shrunken were the thighs that once bulged with saddle muscles She must do something to drag him from his apathybut she could not ask about Mother That must come later when she could stand it Why didnt they burn Tara Gerald stared at her for a moment as if not hearing her and she repeated her question Why he fumbled they used the house as a headquarters Yankeesin this house A feeling that the beloved walls had been defiled rose in her This house sacred because Ellen had lived in it and thosethosein it So they were Daughter We saw the smoke from Twelve Oaks across the river before they came But Miss Honey and Miss India and some of their darkies had refugeed to Macon so we did not worry about them But we couldnt be going to Macon The girls were so sickyour motherwe couldnt be going Our darkies ranIm not knowing where They stole the wagons and the mules Mammy and Dilcey and Porkthey didnt run The girlsyour motherwe couldnt be moving them Yes yes He mustnt talk about Mother Anything else Even that General Sherman himself had used this room Mothers office for his headquarters Anything else The Yankees were moving on Jonesboro to cut the railroad And they came up the road from the riverthousands and thousandsand cannon and horsesthousands I met them on the front porch Oh gallant little Gerald thought Scarlett her heart swelling Gerald meeting the enemy on the stairs of Tara as if an army stood behind him instead of in front of him They said for me to leave that they would be burning the place And I said that they would be burning it over my head We could not leavethe girlsyour mother were And then Must he revert to Ellen always I told them there was sickness in the house the typhoid and it was death to move them They could burn the roof over us I did  Page    Gone With The Wind not want to leave anywayleave Tara His voice trailed off into silence as he looked absently about the walls and Scarlet understood There were too many Irish ancestors crowding behind Geralds shoulders men who had died on scant acres fighting to the end rather than leave the homes where they had lived plowed loved begotten sons I said that they would be burning the house over the heads of three dying women But we would not leave The young officer waswas a gentleman A Yankee a gentleman Why Pa A gentleman He galloped away and soon he was back with a captain a surgeon and he looked at the girlsand your mother You let a damned Yankee into their room He had opium We had none He saved your sisters Suellen was hemorrhaging He was as kind as he knew how And when he reported that they wereillthey did not burn the house They moved in some general his staff crowding in They filled all the rooms except the sick room And the soldiers He paused again as if too tired to go on His stubbly chin sank heavily in loose folds of flesh on his chest With an effort he spoke again They camped all round the house everywhere in the cotton in the corn The pasture was blue with them That night there were a thousand campfires They tore down the fences and burned them to cook with and the barns and the stables and the smokehouse They killed the cows and the hogs and the chickenseven my turkeys Geralds precious turkeys So they were gone They took things even the picturessome of the furniture the china The silver Pork and Mammy did something with the silverput it in the wellbut Im not remembering now Geralds voice was fretful Then they fought the battle from herefrom Tarathere was so much noise people galloping up and stamping about And later the cannon at Jonesboroit sounded like thundereven the girls could hear it sick as they were and they kept saying over and over Papa make it stop thundering  Andand Mother Did she know Yankees were in the house Shenever knew anything Thank God said Scarlett Mother was spared that Mother never knew never heard the enemy in the rooms below never heard the guns at Jonesboro never learned that the land which was part of her heart was under Yankee feet I saw few of them for I stayed upstairs with the girls and your mother I saw the young surgeon mostly He was kind so kind Scarlett After hed worked all day with the wounded he came and sat with them He even left some medicine He told me when they moved on that the girls would recover but your mother She was so frail he saidtoo frail to stand it all He said she had undermined her strength  In the silence that fell Scarlett saw her mother as she must have been in those last days a thin power of strength in Tara nursing working doing without sleep and food that the others might rest and eat And then they moved on Then they moved on He was silent for a long time and then fumbled at her hand Its glad I am you are home he said simply There was a scraping noise on the back porch Poor Pork trained for forty years to clean his shoes before entering the house did not forget even in a time like this He came in carefully carrying two gourds and the strong smell of dripping spirits entered before him Ah spilt a pleny Miss Scarlett Its powful hard ter po outer a bung hole inter a gode Thats quite all right Pork and thank you She took the wet gourd dipper from him her nostrils wrinkling in distaste at the reek Drink this Father she said pushing the whisky in its strange receptacle into his hand and taking the second gourd of water from Pork Gerald raised it obedient as a child and gulped noisily She handed the water to him but he shook his head As she took the whisky from him and held it to her mouth she saw his eyes follow her a vague stirring of disapproval in them I know no lady drinks spirits she said briefly But today Im no lady Pa and there is work to do tonight She tilted the dipper drew a deep breath and drank swiftly The hot liquid burned down her throat to her stomach choking her and bringing tears to her eyes She drew another breath and raised it again Katie Scarlett said Gerald the first note of authority she had heard in his voice since her return that is enough Youre not knowing spirits and they will be making you tipsy Tipsy She laughed an ugly laugh Tipsy I hope it makes me drunk I would like to be drunk and forget all of this She drank again a slow train of warmth lighting in her veins and stealing through her body until even her finger tips tingled What a blessed feeling this kindly fire It seemed to penetrate even her icelocked heart and strength came coursing back into her body Seeing Geralds puzzled hurt face she patted his knee again and managed an imitation of the pert smile he used to love How could it make me tipsy Pa Im your daughter Havent I inherited the steadiest head in Clayton County He almost smiled into her tired face The whisky was bracing him too She handed it back to him Now youre going to take another drink and then I am going to take you upstairs and put you to bed She caught herself Why this was the way she talked to Wadeshe should not address her father like this It was disrespectful But he hung on her words Yes put you to bed she added lightly and give you another drinkmaybe all the dipper and make you go to sleep You need sleep and Katie Scarlett is here so you need not worry about anything Drink He drank again obediently and slipping her arm through his she pulled him to his feet Pork  Pork took the gourd in one hand and Geralds arm in the other Scarlett picked up the flaring candle and the three walked  Page    Gone With The Wind slowly into the dark hall and up the winding steps toward Geralds room The room where Suellen and Carreen lay mumbling and tossing on the same bed stank vilely with the smell of the twisted rag burning in a saucer of bacon fat which provided the only light When Scarlett first opened the door the thick atmosphere of the room with all windows closed and the air reeking with sickroom odors medicine smells and stinking grease almost made her faint Doctors might say that fresh air was fatal in a sick room but if she were to sit here she must have air or die She opened the three windows bringing in the smell of oak leaves and earth but the fresh air could do little toward dispelling the sickening odors which had accumulated for weeks in this close room Carreen and Suellen emaciated and white slept brokenly and awoke to mumble with wide staring eyes in the tall fourposter bed where they had whispered together in better happier days In the corner of the room was an empty bed a narrow French Empire bed with curling head and foot a bed which Ellen had brought from Savannah This was where Ellen had lain Scarlett sat beside the two girls staring at them stupidly The whisky taken on a stomach long empty was playing tricks on her Sometimes her sisters seemed far away and tiny and their incoherent voices came to her like the buzz of insects And again they loomed large rushing at her with lightning speed She was tired tired to the bone She could lie down and sleep for days If she could only lie down and sleep and wake to feel Ellen gentry shaking her arm and saying It is late Scarlett You must not be so lazy But she could not ever do that again If there were only Ellen someone older than she wiser and unweary to whom she could go Someone in whose lap she could lay her head someone on whose shoulders she could rest her burdens The door opened softly and Dilcey entered Melanies baby held to her breast the gourd of whisky in her hand In the smoky uncertain light she seemed thinner than when Scarlett last saw her and the Indian blood was more evident in her face The high cheek bones were more prominent the hawkbridged nose was sharper and her copper skin gleamed with a brighter hue Her faded calico dress was open to the waist and her large bronze breast exposed Held close against her Melanies baby pressed his pale rosebud mouth greedily to the dark nipple sucking gripping tiny fists against the soft flesh like a kitten in the warm fur of its mothers belly Scarlett rose unsteadily and put a hand on Dilceys arm It was good of you to stay Dilcey How could I go off wid them trashy niggers Miss Scarlett after yo pa been so good to buy me and my little Prissy and yo ma been so kine Sit down Dilcey The baby can eat all right then And how is Miss Melanie Nuthin wrong wid this chile cept he hongry and what it take to feed a hongry chile I got Nom Miss Melanie is all right She ain gwine die Miss Scarlett Doan you fret yoseff I seen too many white and black lak her She mighty tired and nervous like and scared fo this baby But I hesh her and give her some of whut was lef in that gode and she sleepin So the corn whisky had been used by the whole family Scarlett thought hysterically that perhaps she had better give a drink to little Wade and see if it would stop his hiccoughs And Melanie would not die And when Ashley came homeif he did come home  No she would think of that later too So much to think oflater So many things to unravelto decide If only she could put off the hour of reckoning forever She started suddenly as a creaking noise and a rhythmic Kerbunkkerbunk broke the stillness of the air outside Thats Mammy gettin the water to sponge off the young Misses They takes a heap of bathin explained Dilcey propping the gourd on the table between medicine bottles and a glass Scarlett laughed suddenly Her nerves must be shredded if the noise of the well windlass bound up in her earliest memories could frighten her Dilcey looked at her steadily as she laughed her face immobile in its dignity but Scarlett felt that Dilcey understood She sank back in her chair If she could only be rid of her tight stays the collar that choked her and the slippers still full of sand and gravel that blistered her feet The windlass creaked slowly as the rope wound up each creak bringing the bucket nearer the top Soon Mammy would be with herEllens Mammy her Mammy She sat silent intent on nothing while the baby already glutted with milk whimpered because he had lost the friendly nipple Dilcey silent too guided the childs mouth back quieting him in her arms as Scarlett listened to the slow scuffing of Mammys feet across the back yard How still the night air was The slightest sounds roared in her ears The upstairs hall seemed to shake as Mammys ponderous weight came toward the door Then Mammy was in the room Mammy with shoulders dragged down by two heavy wooden buckets her kind black face sad with the uncomprehending sadness of a monkeys face Her eyes lighted up at the sight of Scarlett her white teeth gleamed as she set down the buckets and Scarlett ran to her laying her head on the broad sagging breasts which had held so many heads black and white Here was something of stability thought Scarlett something of the old life that was unchanging But Mammys first words dispelled this illusion Mammys chile is home Oh Miss Scarlett now dat Miss Ellens in de grabe whut is we gwine ter do Oh Miss Scarlett effen Ah wuz jes daid longside Miss Ellen Ah kain make out widout Miss Ellen Ain nuthin lef now but mizry an trouble Jes weery loads honey jes weery loads As Scarlett lay with her head hugged close to Mammys breast two words caught her attention weery loads Those were the words which had hummed in her brain that afternoon so monotonously they had sickened her Now she remembered the rest of the song remembered with a sinking heart Just a few more days for to tote the weary load No matter twill never be light Just a few more days till we totter in the road No matter twill never be lightshe took the words to her tired mind Would her load never be light Was coming home to Tara to mean not blessed surcease but only more loads to carry She slipped from Mammys arms and reaching up patted the  Page    Gone With The Wind wrinkled black face Honey yo hans Mammy took the small hands with their blisters and blood clots in hers and looked at them with horrified disapproval Miss Scarlett Ah done tole you an tole you dat you kin allus tell a lady by her hans anyo face sunbuhnt too Poor Mammy still the martinet about such unimportant things even though war and death had just passed over her head In another moment she would be saying that young Misses with blistered hands and freckles most generally didnt never catch husbands and Scarlett forestalled the remark Mammy I want you to tell me about Mother I couldnt bear to hear Pa talk about her Tears started from Mammys eyes as she leaned down to pick up the buckets In silence she carried them to the bedside and turning down the sheet began pulling up the night clothes of Suellen and Carreen Scarlett peering at her sisters in the dim flaring light saw that Carreen wore a nightgown clean but in tatters and Suellen lay wrapped in an old negligee a brown linen garment heavy with tagging ends of Irish lace Mammy cried silently as she sponged the gaunt bodies using the remnant of an old apron as a cloth Miss Scarlett it wuz dem Slatterys dem trashy nogood lowdown powite Slatterys dat kilt Miss Ellen Ah done tole her an tole her it doan do no good doin things fer trashy folks but Miss Ellen

it look lak it wake Miss Ellen up and she set right up in bed and cry out loud time and again Feeleep Feeleep I ain never heerd no sech name but it wuz a name and she wuz callin him Mammy stood as though turned to stone glaring at Dilcey but Scarlett dropped her head into her hands Philippewho was he and what had he been to Mother that she died calling him The long road from Atlanta to Tara had ended ended in a blank wall the road that was to end in Ellens arms Never again could Scarlett lie down as a child secure beneath her fathers roof with the protection of her mothers love wrapped about her like an eiderdown quilt There was no security or haven to which she could turn now No turning or twisting would avoid this dead end to which she had come There was no one on whose shoulders she could rest her burdens Her father was old and stunned her sisters ill Melanie frail and weak the children helpless and the negroes looking up to her with childlike faith clinging to her skirts knowing that Ellens daughter would be the refuge Ellen had always been Through the window in the faint light of the rising moon Tara stretched before her negroes gone acres desolate barns ruined like a body bleeding under her eyes like her own body slowly bleeding This was the end of the road quivering old age sickness hungry mouths helpless hands plucking at her skirts And at the end of this road there was nothingnothing but Scarlett OHara Hamilton nineteen years old a widow with a little child What would she do with all of this Aunt Pitty and the Burrs in Macon could take Melanie and her baby If the girls recovered Ellens family would have to take them whether they liked it or not And she and Gerald could turn to Uncle James and Andrew She looked at the thin forms tossing before her the sheets about them moist and dark from dripping water She did not like  Page    Gone With The Wind Suellen She saw it now with a sudden clarity She had never liked her She did not especially love Carreenshe could not love anyone who was weak But they were of her blood part of Tara No she could not let them live out their lives in their aunts homes as poor relations An OHara a poor relation living on charity bread and sufferance Oh never that Was there no escape from this dead end Her tired brain moved so slowly She raised her hands to her head as wearily as if the air were water against which her arms struggled She took the gourd from between the glass and bottle and looked in it There was some whisky left in the bottom how much she could not tell in the uncertain light Strange that the sharp smell did not offend her nostrils now She drank slowly but this time the liquid did not burn only a dull warmth followed She set down the empty gourd and looked about her This was all a dream this smokefilled dim room the scrawny girls Mammy shapeless and huge crouching beside the bed Dilcey a still bronze image with the sleeping pink morsel against her dark breastall a dream from which she would awake to smell bacon frying in the kitchen hear the throaty laughter of the negroes and the creaking of wagons fieldward bound and Ellens gentle insistent hand upon her Then she discovered she was in her own room on her own bed faint moonlight pricking the darkness and Mammy and Dilcey were undressing her The torturing stays no longer pinched her waist and she could breathe deeply and quietly to the bottom of her lungs and her abdomen She felt her stockings being stripped gently from her and heard Mammy murmuring indistinguishable comforting sounds as she bathed her blistered feet How cool the water was how good to lie here in softness like a child She sighed and relaxed and after a time which might have been a year or a second she was alone and the room was brighter as the rays of the moon streamed in across the bed She did not know she was drunk drunk with fatigue and whisky She only knew she had left her tired body and floated somewhere above it where there was no pain and weariness and her brain saw things with an inhuman clarity She was seeing things with new eyes for somewhere along the long road to Tara she had left her girlhood behind her She was no longer plastic clay yielding imprint to each new experience The clay had hardened some time in this indeterminate day which had lasted a thousand years Tonight was the last time she would ever be ministered to as a child She was a woman now and youth was gone No she could not would not turn to Geralds or Ellens families The OHaras did not take charity The OHaras looked after their own Her burdens were her own and burdens were for shoulders strong enough to bear them She thought without surprise looking down from her height that her shoulders were strong enough to bear anything now having borne the worst that could ever happen to her She could not desert Tara she belonged to the red acres far more than they could ever belong to her Her roots went deep into the bloodcolored soil and sucked up life as did the cotton She would stay at Tara and keep it somehow keep her father and her sisters Melanie and Ashleys child the negroes Tomorrowoh tomorrow Tomorrow she would fit the yoke about her neck Tomorrow there would be so many things to do Go to Twelve Oaks and the Macintosh place and see if anything was left in the deserted gardens go to the river swamps and beat them for straying hogs and chickens go to Jonesboro and Lovejoy with Ellens jewelrythere must be someone left there who would sell something to eat Tomorrowtomorrowher brain ticked slowly and more slowly like a clock running down but the clarity of vision persisted Of a sudden the ofttold family tales to which she had listened since babyhood listened halfbored impatient and but partly comprehending were crystal clear Gerald penniless had raised Tara Ellen had risen above some mysterious sorrow Grandfather Robillard surviving the wreck of Napoleons throne had founded his fortunes anew on the fertile Georgia coast Greatgrandfather Prudhomme had carved a small kingdom out of the dark jungles of Haiti lost it and lived to see his name honored in Savannah There were the Scarletts who had fought with the Irish Volunteers for a free Ireland and been hanged for their pains and the OHaras who died at the Boyne battling to the end for what was theirs All had suffered crushing misfortunes and had not been crushed They had not been broken by the crash of empires the machetes of revolting slaves war rebellion proscription confiscation Malign fate had broken their necks perhaps but never their hearts They had not whined they had fought And when they died they died spent but unquenched All of those shadowy folks whose blood flowed in her veins seemed to move quietly in the moonlit room And Scarlett was not surprised to see them these kinsmen who had taken the worst that fate could send and hammered it into the best Tara was her fate her fight and she must conquer it She turned drowsily on her side a slow creeping blackness enveloping her mind Were they really there whispering wordless encouragement to her or was this part of her dream Whether you are there or not she murmured sleepily good nightand thank you CHAPTER XXV THE NEXT MORNING Scarletts body was so stiff and sore from the long miles of walking and jolting in the wagon that every movement was agony Her face was crimson with sunburn and her blistered palms raw Her tongue was furred and her throat parched as if flames had scorched it and no amount of water could assuage her thirst Her head felt swollen and she winced even when she turned her eyes A queasiness of the stomach reminiscent of the early days of her pregnancy made the smoking yams on the breakfast table unendurable even to the smell Gerald could have told her she was suffering the normal aftermath of her first experience with hard drinking but Gerald noticed nothing He sat at the head of the table a gray old man with absent faded eyes fastened on the door and head cocked slightly to hear the rustle of Ellens petticoats to smell the lemon verbena sachet As Scarlett sat down he mumbled We will wait for Mrs OHara She is late She raised an aching head looked at him with startled incredulity and met the pleading eyes of Mammy who stood behind Geralds chair She rose unsteadily her hand at her throat and looked down at her father in the morning sunlight He peered up at her vaguely and she saw that his hands were shaking that his head trembled a little Until this moment she had not realized how much she had counted on Gerald to take command to tell her what she must do and now Why last night he had seemed almost himself There had been none of his usual bluster and vitality but at least he  Page    Gone With The Wind had told a connected story and nownow he did not even remember Ellen was dead The combined shock of the coming of the Yankees and her death had stunned him She started to speak but Mammy shook her head vehemently and raising her apron dabbed at her red eyes Oh can Pa have lost his mind thought Scarlett and her throbbing head felt as if it would crack with this added strain No no Hes just dazed by it all Ifs like he was sick Hell get over it He must get over it What will I do if he doesntI wont think about it now I wont think of him or Mother or any of these awful things now No not till I can stand it There are too many other things to think aboutthings that can be helped without my thinking of those I cant help She left the dining room without eating and went out onto the back porch where she found Pork barefooted and in the ragged remains of his best livery sitting on the steps cracking peanuts Her head was hammering and throbbing and the bright sunlight stabbed into her eyes Merely holding herself erect required an effort of will power and she talked as briefly as possible dispensing with the usual forms of courtesy her mother had always taught her to use with negroes She began asking questions so brusquely and giving orders so decisively Porks eyebrows went up in mystification Miss Ellen didnt never talk so short to nobody not even when she caught them stealing pullets and watermelons She asked again about the fields the gardens the stock and her green eyes had a hard bright glaze which Pork had never seen in them before Yasm dat hawse daid lyin dar whar Ah tie him wid his nose in de water bucket he tuhned over Nom de cow ain daid Din you know She done have a calf las night Dat why she beller so A fine midwife your Prissy will make Scarlett remarked caustically She said she was bellowing because she needed milking Wellm Prissy ain fixin ter be no cow midwife Miss Scarlett Pork said tactfully An ain no use quarrelin wid blessins cause dat calf gwine ter mean a full cow an pleny buttermilk fer de young Misses lak dat Yankee doctah say dey need All right go on Any stock left Nom Nuthin cept one ole sow an her litter Ah driv dem inter de swamp de day de Yankees come but de Lawd knows how we gwine git dem She mean dat sow Well get them all right You and Prissy can start right now hunting for her Pork was amazed and indignant Miss Scarlett dat a feel hans bizness Ahs allus been a house nigger A small fiend with a pair of hot tweezers plucked behind Scarletts eyeballs You two will catch the sowor get out of here like the field hands did Tears trembled in Porks hurt eyes Oh if only Miss Ellen was here She understood such niceties and realized the wide gap between the duties of a field hand and those of a house nigger Git out Miss Scarlett Whard Ah git out to Miss Scarlett I dont know and I dont care But anyone at Tara who wont work can go hunt up the Yankees You can tell the others that too Yasm Now what about the corn and the cotton Pork De cawn Lawd Miss Scarlett dey pasture dey hawses in de cawn an cahied off whut de hawses din eat or spile An dey driv dey cannons an waggins cross de cotton till it plum ruint cept a few acres over on de creek bottom dat dey din notice But dat cotton ain wuth foolin wid cause ain but bout three bales over dar Three bales Scarlett thought of the scores of bales Tara usually yielded and her head hurt worse Three bales That was little more than the shiftless Slatterys raised To make matters worse there was the question of taxes The Confederate government took cotton for taxes in lieu of money but three bales wouldnt even cover the taxes Little did it matter though to her or the Confederacy now that all the field hands had run away and there was no one to pick the cotton Well I wont think of that either she told herself Taxes arent a womans job anyway Pa ought to look after such things but Pa I wont think of Pa now The Confederacy can whistle for its taxes What we need now is something to eat Pork have any of you been to Twelve Oaks or the Macintosh place to see if theres anything left in the gardens there No Mam Us ain lef Tara De Yankees mout git us Ill send Dilcey over to Macintosh Perhaps shell find something there And Ill go to Twelve Oaks Who wid chile By myself Mammy must stay with the girls and Mr Gerald cant Pork set up an outcry which she found infuriating There might be Yankees or mean niggers at Twelve Oaks She mustnt go alone That will be enough Pork Tell Dilcey to start immediately And you and Prissy go bring in the sow and her litter she said briefly turning on her heel Mammys old sunbonnet faded but clean hung on its peg on the back porch and Scarlett put it on her head remembering as from another world the bonnet with the curling green plume which Rhett had brought her from Paris She picked up a large splitoak basket and started down the back stairs each step jouncing her head until her spine seemed to be trying to crash through the top of her skull The road down to the river lay red and scorching between the ruined cotton fields There were no trees to cast a shade and the sun beat down through Mammys sunbonnet as if it were made of tarlatan instead of heavy quilted calico while the dust floating upward sifted into her nose and throat until she felt the membranes would crack dryly if she spoke Deep ruts and furrows were cut into the road where horses had dragged heavy guns along it and the red gullies on either side were deeply gashed by the wheels The cotton was mangled and trampled where cavalry and infantry forced off the narrow road by the artillery had marched through the green bushes grinding them into the earth Here and mere in the road and fields lay buckles and bits of harness leather canteens flattened by hooves and caisson wheels buttons blue caps worn socks bits of bloody rags all the litter left by the marching army  Page    Gone With The Wind She passed the clump of cedars and the low brick wall which marked the family burying ground trying not to think of the new grave lying by the three short mounds of her little brothers Oh Ellen She trudged on down the dusty hill passing the heap of ashes and the stumpy chimney where the Slattery house had stood and she wished savagely that the whole tribe of them had been part of the ashes If it hadnt been for the Slatterysif it hadnt been for that nasty Emmie whod had a bastard brat by their overseerEllen wouldnt have died She moaned as a sharp pebble cut into her blistered foot What was she doing here Why was Scarlett OHara the belle of the County the sheltered pride of Tara tramping down this rough road almost barefoot Her little feet were made to dance not to limp her tiny slippers to peep daringly from under bright silks not to collect sharp pebbles and dust She was born to be pampered and waited upon and here she was sick and ragged driven by hunger to hunt for food in the gardens of her neighbors At the bottom of the long hill was the river and how cool and still were the tangled trees overhanging the water She sank down on the low bank and stripping off the remnants of her slippers and stockings dabbled her burning feet in the cool water It would be so good to sit here all day away from the helpless eyes of Tara here where only the rustle of leaves and the gurgle of slow water broke the stillness But reluctantly she replaced her shoes and stockings and trudged down the bank spongy with moss under the shady trees The Yankees had burned the bridge but she knew of a footlog bridge across a narrow point of the stream a hundred yards below She crossed it cautiously and trudged uphill the hot halfmile to Twelve Oaks There towered the twelve oaks as they had stood since Indian days but with their leaves brown from fire and the branches burned and scorched Within their circle lay the ruins of John Wilkes house the charred remains of that once stately home which had crowned the hill in whitecolumned dignity The deep pit which had been the cellar the blackened fieldstone foundations and two mighty chimneys marked the site One long column halfburned had fallen across the lawn crushing the cape jessamine bushes Scarlett sat down on the column too sick at the sight to go on This desolation went to her heart as nothing she had ever experienced Here was the Wilkes pride in the dust at her feet Here was the end of the kindly courteous house which had always welcomed her the house where in futile dreams she had aspired to be mistress Here she had danced and dined and flirted and here she had watched with a jealous hurting heart how Melanie smiled up at Ashley Here too in the cool shadows of the trees Charles Hamilton had rapturously pressed her hand when she said she would marry him Oh Ashley she thought I hope you are dead I could never bear for you to see this Ashley had married his bride here but his son and his sons son would never bring brides to this house There would be no more matings and births beneath this roof which she had so loved and longed to rule The house was dead and to Scarlett it was as if all the Wilkeses too were dead in its ashes I wont think of it now I cant stand it now Ill think of it later she said aloud turning her eyes away Seeking the garden she limped around the ruins by the trampled rose beds the Wilkes girls had tended so zealously across the back yard and through the ashes to the smokehouse barns and chicken houses The splitrail fence around the kitchen garden had been demolished and the once orderly rows of green plants had suffered the same treatment as those at Tara The soft earth was scarred with hoof prints and heavy wheels and the vegetables were mashed into the soil There was nothing for her here She walked back across the yard and took the path down toward the silent row of whitewashed cabins in the quarters calling Hello as she went But no voice answered her Not even a dog barked Evidently the Wilkes negroes had taken flight or followed the Yankees She knew every slave had his own garden patch and as she reached the quarters she hoped these little patches had been spared Her search was rewarded but she was too tired even to feel pleasure at the sight of turnips and cabbages wilted for want of water but still standing and straggling butter beans and snap beans yellow but edible She sat down in the furrows and dug into the earth with hands that shook filling her basket slowly There would be a good meal at Tara tonight in spite of the lack of side meat to boil with the vegetables Perhaps some of the bacon grease Dilcey was using for illumination could be used for seasoning She must remember to tell Dilcey to use pine knots and save the grease for cooking Close to the back step of one cabin she found a short row of radishes and hunger assaulted her suddenly A spicy sharptasting radish was exactly what her stomach craved Hardly waiting to rub the dirt off on her skirt she bit off half and swallowed it hastily It was old and coarse and so peppery that tears started in her eyes No sooner had the lump gone down than her empty outraged stomach revolted and she lay in the soft dirt and vomited tiredly The faint niggery smell which crept from the cabin increased her nausea and without strength to combat it she kept on retching miserably while the cabins and trees revolved swiftly around her After a long time she lay weakly on her face the earth as soft and comfortable as a feather pillow and her mind wandered feebly here and there She Scarlett OHara was lying behind a negro cabin in the midst of ruins too sick and too weak to move and no one in the world knew or cared No one would care if they did know for everyone had too many troubles of his own to worry about her And all this was happening to her Scarlett OHara who had never raised her hand even to pick up her discarded stockings from the floor or to tie the laces of her slippersScarlett whose little headaches and tempers had been coddled and catered to all her life As she lay prostrate too weak to fight off memories and worries they rushed at her like buzzards waiting for death No longer had she the strength to say Ill think of Mother and Pa and Ashley and all this ruin later Yes later when I can stand it She could not stand it now but she was thinking of them whether she willed it or not The thoughts circled and swooped above her dived down and drove tearing claws and sharp beaks into her mind For a timeless time she lay still her face in the dirt the sun beating hotly upon her remembering things and people who were dead remembering a way of living that was gone foreverand looking upon the harsh vista of the dark future When she arose at last and saw again the black ruins of Twelve Oaks her head was raised high and something that was youth and beauty and potential tenderness had gone out of her face forever What was past was past Those who were dead were dead The lazy luxury of the old days was gone never to return And as Scarlett settled the heavy basket across her arm she had settled her own mind and her own life  Page    Gone With The Wind There was no going back and she was going forward Throughout the South for fifty years there would be bittereyed women who looked backward to dead times to dead men evoking memories that hurt and were futile bearing poverty with bitter pride because they had those memories But Scarlett was never to look back She gazed at the blackened stones and for the last time she saw Twelve Oaks rise before her eyes as it had once stood rich and proud symbol of a race and a way of living Then she started down the road toward Tara the heavy basket cutting into her flesh Hunger gnawed at her empty stomach again and she said aloud As God is my witness as God is my witness the Yankees arent going to lick me Im going to live through this and when its over Im never going to be hungry again No nor any of my folks If I have to steal or kill as God is my witness Im never going to be hungry again In the days that followed Tara might have been Crusoes desert island so still it was so isolated from the rest of the world The world lay only a few miles away but a thousand miles of tumbling waves might have stretched between Tara and Jonesboro and Fayetteville and Lovejoy even between Tara and the neighbors plantations With the old horse dead their one mode of con veyance was gone and there was neither time nor strength for walking the weary red miles Sometimes in the days of backbreaking work in the desperate struggle for food and the neverceasing care of the three sick girls Scarlett found herself straining her ears for familiar soundsthe shrill laughter of the pickaninnies in the quarters the creaking of wagons home from the fields the thunder of Geralds stallion tearing across the pasture the crunching of carriage wheels on the drive and the gay voices of neighbors dropping in for an afternoon of gossip But she listened in vain The road lay still and deserted and never a cloud of red dust proclaimed the approach of visitors Tara was an island in a sea of rolling green hills and red fields Somewhere was the world and families who ate and slept safely under their own roofs Somewhere girls in thriceturned dresses were flirting gaily and singing When This Cruel War Is Over as she had done only a few weeks before Somewhere there was a war and cannon booming and burning towns and men who rotted in hospitals amid sickeningsweet stinks Somewhere a barefoot army in dirty homespun was marching fighting sleeping hungry and weary with the weariness that comes when hope is gone And somewhere the hills of Georgia were blue with Yankees wellfed Yankees on sleek cornstuffed horses Beyond Tara was the war and the world But on the plantation the war and the world did not exist except as memories which must be fought back when they rushed to mind in moments of exhaustion The world outside receded before the demands of empty and halfempty stomachs and life resolved itself into two related thoughts food and how to get it Food Food Why did the stomach have a longer memory man the mind Scarlett could banish heartbreak but not hunger and each morning as she lay half asleep before memory brought back to her mind war and hunger she curled drowsily expecting the sweet smells of bacon frying and rolls baking And each morning she sniffed so hard to really smell the food she woke herself up There were apples yams peanuts and milk on the table at Tara but never enough of even this primitive fare At the sight of them three times a day her memory would rush back to the old days the meals of the old days the candlelit table and the food perfuming the air How careless they had been of food then what prodigal waste Rolls corn muffins biscuits and waffles dripping butter all at one meal Ham at one end of the table and fried chicken at the other collards swimming richly in pot liquor iridescent with grease snap beans in mountains on brightly flowered porcelain fried squash stewed okra carrots in cream sauce thick enough to cut And three desserts so everyone might have his choice chocolate layer cake vanilla blanc mange and pound cake topped with sweet whipped cream The memory of those savory meals had the power to bring tears to her eyes as death and war had failed to do and the power to turn her evergnawing stomach from rumbling emptiness to nausea For the appetite Mammy had always deplored the healthy appetite of a nineteenyearold girl now was increased fourfold by the hard and unremitting labor she had never known before Hers was not the only troublesome appetite at Tara for wherever she turned hungry faces black and white met her eyes Soon Carreen and Suellen would have the insatiable hunger of typhoid convalescents Already little Wade whined monotonously Wade doan like yams Wade hungwy The others grumbled too Miss Scarlett ness I gits mo to eat I kain nuss neither of these chillun Miss Scarlett ef Ah doan have mo in mah stummick Ah kain split no wood Lamb Ahs perishra fer real vittles Daughter must we always have yams Only Melanie did not complain Melanie whose face grew thinner and whiter and twitched with pain even in her sleep Im not hungry Scarlett Give my share of the milk to Dilcey She needs it to nurse the babies Sick people are never hungry It was her gentle hardihood which irritated Scarlett more than the nagging whining voices of the others She couldand didshout them down with bitter sarcasm but before Melanies unselfishness she was helpless helpless and resentful Gerald the negroes and Wade clung to Melanie now because even in her weakness she was kind and sympathetic and these days Scarlett was neither Wade especially haunted Melanies room There was something wrong with Wade but just what it was Scarlett had no time to discover She took Mammys word that the little boy had worms and dosed him with the mixture of dried herbs and bark which Ellen always used to worm the pickaninnies But the vermifuge only made the child look paler These days Scarlett hardly thought of Wade as a person He was only another worry another mouth to feed Some day when the present emergency was over she would play with him tell him stories and teach him his ABCs but now she did not have the time or the soul or the inclination And because he always seemed underfoot when she was most weary and worried she often spoke sharply to him It annoyed her that her quick reprimands brought such acute fright to his round eyes for he looked so simple minded when he was frightened She did not realize that the little boy lived shoulder to shoulder with terror too great for an adult to comprehend  Page    Gone With The Wind Fear lived with Wade fear that shook his soul and made him wake screaming in the night Any unexpected noise or sharp word set him to trembling for in his mind noises and harsh words were inextricably mixed with Yankees and he was more afraid of Yankees than of Prissys hants Until the thunders of the siege began he had never known anything but a happy placid quiet life Even though his mother paid him little attention he had known nothing but petting and kind words until the night when he was jerked from slumber to find the sky aflame and the air deafening with explosions In that night and the day which followed he had been slapped by his mother for the first time and had heard her voice raised at him in harsh words Life in the pleasant brick house on Peachtree Street the only life he knew had vanished that night and he would never recover from its loss In the flight from Atlanta he had understood nothing except that the Yankees were after him and now he still lived in fear that the Yankees would catch him and cut him to pieces Whenever Scarlett raised her voice in reproof he went weak with fright as his vague childish memory brought up the horrors of the first time she had ever done it Now Yankees and a cross voice were linked forever in his mind and he was afraid of his mother Scarlett could not help noticing that the child was beginning to avoid her and in the rare moments when her unending duties gave her time to think about it it bothered her a great deal It was even worse than having him at her skirts all the time and she was offended that his refuge was Melanies bed where he played quietly at games Melanie suggested or listened to stories she told Wade adored Auntee who had a gentle voice who always smiled and who never said Hush Wade You give me a headache or Stop fidgeting Wade for Heavens sake Scarlett had neither the time nor the impulse to pet him but it made her jealous to see Melanie do it When she found him one day standing on his head in Melanies bed and saw him collapse on her she slapped him Dont you know better than to jiggle Auntee like that when shes sick Now trot right out in the yard and play and dont come in here again But Melanie reached out a weak arm and drew the wailing child to her There there Wade You didnt mean to jiggle me did you He doesnt bother me Scarlett Do let him stay with me Let me take care of him Its the only thing I can do till I get well and youve got your hands full enough without having to watch him Dont be a goose Melly said Scarlett shortly You arent getting well like you should and having Wade fall on your stomach wont help you Now Wade if I ever catch you on Auntees bed again Ill wear you out And stop sniffling You are always sniffling Try to be a little man Wade flew sobbing to hide himself under the house Melanie bit her lip and tears came to her eyes and Mammy standing in the hall a witness to the scene scowled and breathed hard But no one talked back to Scarlett these days They were all afraid of her sharp tongue all afraid of the new person who walked in her body Scarlett reigned supreme at Tara now and like others suddenly elevated to authority all the Bullying instincts in her nature rose to the surface It was not that she was basically unkind It was because she was so frightened and unsure of herself she was harsh lest others learn her inadequacies and refuse her authority Besides there was some pleasure in shouting at people and knowing they were afraid Scarlett found that it relieved her overwrought nerves She was not blind to the fact that her personality was changing Sometimes when her curt orders made Pork stick out his under lip and Mammy mutter Some folks rides mighty high dese days she wondered where her good manners had gone All the courtesy all the gentleness Ellen had striven to instill in her had fallen away from her as quickly as leaves fall from trees in the first chill wind of autumn Time and again Ellen had said Be firm but be gentle with inferiors especially darkies But if she was gentle the darkies would sit in the kitchen all day talking endlessly about the good old days when a house nigger wasnt supposed to do a field hands work Love and cherish your sisters Be kind to the afflicted said Ellen Show tenderness to those in sorrow and in trouble She couldnt love her sisters now They were simply a dead weight on her shoulders And as for cherishing them wasnt she bathing them combing their hair andfeeding them even at the expense of walking miles every day to find vegetables Wasnt she learning to milk the cow even though her heart was always in her throat when that fearsome animal shook its horns at her And as for being kind that was a waste of time If she was overly kind to them theyd probably prolong their stay in bed and she wanted them on their feet again as soon as possible so there would be four more hands to help her They were convalescing slowly and lay scrawny and weak in their bed While they had been unconscious the world had changed The Yankees had come the darkies had gone and Mother had died Here were three unbelievable happenings and their minds could not take them in Sometimes they believed they must still be delirious and these things had not happened at all Certainly Scarlett was so changed she couldnt be real When she hung over the foot of their bed and outlined the work she expected them to do when they recovered they looked at her as if she were a hobgoblin It was beyond their comprehension that they no longer had a hundred slaves to do the work It was beyond their comprehension that an OHara lady should do manual labor But Sister said Carreen her sweet childish face blank with consternation I couldnt split kindling It would ruin my hands Look at mine answered Scarlett with a frightening smile as she pushed blistered and calloused palms toward her I think you are hateful to talk to Baby and me like this cried Suellen I think you are lying and trying to frighten us If Mother were only here she wouldnt let you talk to us like this Split kindling indeed Suellen looked with weak loathing at her older sister feeling sure Scarlett said these things just to be mean Suellen had nearly died and she had lost her mother and she was lonely and scared and she wanted to be petted and made much of Instead Scarlett looked over the foot of the bed each day appraising their improvement with a hateful new gleam in her slanting green eyes and talked about making beds preparing food carrying water buckets and splitting kindling And she looked as if she took a pleasure in saying such awful things Scarlett did take pleasure in it She bullied the negroes and harrowed the feelings of her sisters not only because she was too worried and strained and tired to do otherwise but because it helped her to forget her own bitterness that everything her mother  Page    Gone With The Wind had told her about life was wrong Nothing her mother had taught her was of any value whatsoever now and Scarletts heart was sore and puzzled It did not occur to her that Ellen could not have foreseen the collapse of the civilization in which she raised her daughters could not have anticipated the disappearings of the places in society for which she trained them so well It did not occur to her that Ellen had looked down a vista of placid future years all like the uneventful years of her own life when she had taught her to be gentle and gracious honorable and kind modest and truthful Life treated women well when they had learned those lessons said Ellen Scarlett thought in despair Nothing no nothing she taught me is of any help to me What good will kindness do me now What value is gentleness Better that Id learned to plow or chop cotton like a darky Oh Mother you were wrong She did not stop to think that Ellens ordered world was gone and a brutal world had taken its place a world wherein every standard every value had changed She only saw or thought she saw that her mother had been wrong and she changed swiftly to meet this new world for which she was not prepared Only her feeling for Tara had not changed She never came wearily home across the fields and saw the sprawling white house that her heart did not swell with love and the joy of homecoming She never looked out of her window at green pastures and red fields and tall tangled swamp forest that a sense of beauty did not fill her Her love for this land with its softly rolling hills of brightred soil this beautiful red earth that was blood colored garnet brick dust vermilion which so miraculously grew green bushes starred with white puffs was one part of Scarlett which did not change when all else was changing Nowhere else in the world was there land like this When she looked at Tara she could understand in part why wars were fought Rhett was wrong when he said men fought wars for money No they fought for swelling acres softly furrowed by the plow for pastures green with stubby cropped grass for lazy yellow rivers and white houses that were cool amid magnolias These were the only things worth fighting for the red earth which was theirs and would be their sons the red earth which would bear cotton for their sons and their sons sons The trampled acres of Tara were all that was left to her now that Mother and Ashley were gone now that Gerald was senile from shock and money and darkies and security and position had vanished overnight As from another world she remembered a conversation with her father about the land and wondered how she could have been so young so ignorant as not to understand what he meant when he said that the land was the one thing in the world worth fighting for For tis the only thing in the world that lasts  and to anyone with a drop of Irish blood in them the land they live on is like their mother  Tis the only thing worth working for fighting for dying for Yes Tara was worth fighting for and she accepted simply and without question the fight No one was going to get Tara away from her No one was going to set her and her people adrift on the charity of relatives She would hold Tara if she had to break the back of every person on it CHAPTER XXVI SCARLETT HAD BEEN AT TARA two weeks since her return from Atlanta when the largest blister on her foot began to fester swelling until it was impossible for her to put on her shoe or do more than hobble about on her heel Desperation plucked at her when she looked at the angry sore on her toe Suppose it should gangrene like the soldiers wounds and she should die far away from a doctor Bitter as life was now she had no desire to leave it And who would look after Tara if she should die She had hoped when she first came home that Geralds old spirit would revive and he would take command but in these two weeks that hope had vanished She knew now that whether she liked it or not she had the plantation and all its people on her two inexperienced hands for Gerald still sat quietly like a man in a dream so frighteningly absent from Tara so gentle To her pleas for advice he gave as his only answer Do what you think best Daughter Or worse still Consult with your mother Puss He never would be any different and now Scarlett realized the truth and accepted it without emotionthat until he died Gerald would always be waiting for Ellen always listening for her He was in some dim borderline country where time was standing still and Ellen was always in the next room The mainspring of his existence was taken away when she died and with it had gone his bounding assurance his impudence and his restless vitality Ellen was the audience before which the blustering drama of Gerald OHara had been played Now the curtain had been rung down forever the footlights dimmed and the audience suddenly vanished while the stunned old actor remained on his empty stage waiting for his cues That morning the house was still for everyone except Scarlett Wade and the three sick girls was in the swamp hunting the sow Even Gerald had aroused a little and stumped off across the furrowed fields one hand on Porks arm and a coil of rope in the other Suellen and Careen had cried themselves to sleep as they did at least twice a day when they thought of Ellen tears of grief and weakness oozing down their sunken cheeks Melanie who had been propped up on pillows for the first time that day lay covered with a mended sheet between two babies the downy flaxen head of one cuddled in her arm the kinky black head of Dilceys child held as gently in the other Wade sat at the bottom of the bed listening to a fairy story To Scarlett the stillness at Tara was unbearable for it reminded her too sharply of the deathlike stillness of the desolate country through which she had passed that long day on her way home from Atlanta The cow and the calf had made no sound for hours There were no birds twittering outside her window and even the noisy family of mockers who had lived among the harshly rustling leaves of the magnolia for generations had no song that day She had drawn a low chair close to the open window of her bedroom looking out on the front drive the lawn and the empty green pasture across the road and she sat with her skirts well above her knees and her chin resting on her arms on the window sill There was a bucket of well water on the floor beside her and every now and then she lowered her blistered foot into it screwing up her face at the stinging sensation Fretting she dug her chin into her arm Just when she needed her strength most this toe had to fester Those fools would never catch the sow It had taken them a week to capture the pigs one by one and now after two weeks the sow was still at liberty Scarlett knew that if she were just there in the swamp with them she could tuck up her dress to her knees and take the rope and lasso the sow before you could say Jack Robinson But even after the sow was caughtif she were caught What then after she and her litter were eaten Life would go on and so  Page    Gone With The Wind would appetites Winter was coming and there would be no food not even the poor remnants of the vegetables from the neighbors gardens They must have dried peas and sorghum and meal and rice andandoh so many things Corn and cotton seed for next springs planting and new clothes too Where was it all to come from and how would she pay for it She had privately gone through Geralds pockets and his cash box and all she could find was stacks of Confederate bonds and three thousand dollars in Confederate bills That was about enough to buy one square meal for them all she thought ironically now that Confederate money was worth almost less than nothing at all But if she did have money and could find food how would she haul it home to Tara Why had God let the old horse die Even that sorry animal Rhett had stolen would make all the difference in the world to them Oh those fine sleek mules which used to kick up their heels in the pasture across the road and the handsome carriage horses her little mare the girls ponies and Geralds big stallion racing about and tearing up the turf Oh for one of them even the balkiest mule But no matterwhen her foot healed she would walk to Jonesboro It would be the longest walk she had ever taken in her life but walk it she would Even if the Yankees had burned the town completely she would certainly find someone in the neighborhood who could tell her where to get food Wades pinched face rose up before her eyes He didnt like yams he repeated wanted a drumstick and some rice and gravy The bright sunlight in the front yard suddenly clouded and the trees blurred through tears Scarlett dropped her head on her arms and struggled not to cry Crying was so useless now The only time crying ever did any good was when there was a man around from whom you wished favors As she crouched there squeezing her eyes tightly to keep back the tears she was startled by the sound of trotting hooves But she did not raise her head She had imagined that sound too often in the nights and days of these last two weeks just as she had imagined she heard the rustle of Ellens skirts Her heart hammered as it always did at such moments before she told herself sternly Dont be a fool But the hooves slowed down in a startlingly natural way to the rhythm of a walk and there was the measured scrunchscrunch on the gravel It was a horsethe Tarletons the Fontaines She looked up quickly It was a Yankee cavalryman Automatically she dodged behind the curtain and peered fascinated at him through the dim folds of the cloth so startled that the breath went out of her lungs with a gasp He sat slouched in the saddle a thick roughlooking man with an unkempt black beard straggling over his unbuttoned brae jacket Little closeset eyes squinting in the sun glare calmly surveyed the house from beneath the visor of his tight brae cap As he slowly dismounted and tossed the bridle reins over the hitching post Scarletts breath came back to her as suddenly and painfully as after a blow in the stomach A Yankee a Yankee with a long pistol on his hip And she was alone in the house with three sick girls and the babies As he lounged up the walk hand on holster beady little eyes glancing to right and left a kaleidoscope of jumbled pictures spun in her mind stories Aunt Pittypat had whispered of attacks on unprotected women throat cuttings houses burned over the heads of dying women children bayoneted because they cried all of the unspeakable horrors that lay bound up in the name of Yankee Her first terrified impulse was to hide in the closet crawl under the bed fly down the back stairs and run screaming to the swamp anything to escape him Then she heard his cautious feet on the front steps and his stealthy tread as he entered the hall and she knew that escape was cut off Too cold with fear to move she heard his progress from room to room downstairs his steps growing louder and bolder as he discovered no one Now he was in the dining room and in a moment he would walk out into the kitchen At the thought of the kitchen rage suddenly leaped up in Scarletts breast so sharply that it jabbed at her heart like a knife thrust and fear fell away before her overpowering fury The kitchen There over the open kitchen fire were two pots one filled with apples stewing and the other with a hodgepodge of vegetables brought painfully from Twelve Oaks and the Macintosh gardendinner that must serve for nine hungry people and hardly enough for two Scarlett had been restraining her appetite for hours waiting for the return of the others and the thought of the Yankee eating their meager meal made her shake with anger God damn them all They descended like locusts and left Tara to starve slowly and now they were back again to steal the poor leavings Her empty stomach writhed within her By God this was one Yankee who would do no more stealing She slipped off her worn shoe and barefooted she pattered swiftly to the bureau not even feeling her festered toe She opened the top drawer soundlessly and caught up the heavy pistol she had brought from Atlanta the weapon Charles had worn but never fired She fumbled in the leather box that hung on the wall below his saber and brought out a cap She slipped it into place with a hand that did not shake Quickly and noiselessly she ran into the upper hall and down the stairs steadying herself on the banisters with one hand and holding the pistol close to her thigh in the folds of her skirt Whos there cried a nasal voice and she stopped on the middle of the stairs the blood thudding in her ears so loudly she could hardly hear him Halt or Ill shoot came the voice He stood in the door of the dining room crouched tensely his pistol in one hand and in the other the small rosewood sewing box fitted with gold thimble goldhandled scissors and tiny goldtopped acorn of emery Scarletts legs felt cold to the knees but rage scorched her face Ellens sewing box in his hands She wanted to cry Put it down Put it down you dirty but words would not come She could only stare over the banisters at him and watch his face change from harsh tenseness to a halfcon temptuous halfingratiating smile So there is somebody at home he said slipping his pistol back into its holster and moving into the hall until he stood directly below her All alone little lady Like lightning she shoved her weapon over the banisters and into the startled bearded face Before he could even fumble at his belt she pulled the trigger The back kick of the pistol made her reel as the roar of the explosion filled her ears and the acrid smoke stung her nostrils The man crashed backwards to the floor sprawling into the dining room with a violence that shook the furniture The box clattered from his hand the contents spilling about him Hardly aware that she was moving Scarlett ran down the stairs and stood over him gazing down into what was left of the face above the beard a bloody pit where the nose had been glazing eyes burned with powder As she looked two streams of blood crept across the shining floor one from his face and one  Page    Gone With The Wind from the back of his head Yes he was dead Undoubtedly She had killed a man The smoke curled slowly to the ceiling and the red streams widened about her feet For a timeless moment she stood there and in the still hot hush of the summer morning every irrelevant sound and scent seemed magnified the quick thudding of her heart like a drumbeat the slight rough rustling of the magnolia leaves the faroff plaintive sound of a swamp bird and the sweet smell of the flowers outside the window She had killed a man she who took care never to be in at the kill on a hunt she who could not bear the squealing of a hog at slaughter or the squeak of a rabbit in a snare Murder she thought dully Ive done murder Oh this cant be happening to me Her eyes went to the stubby hairy hand on the floor so close to the sewing box and suddenly she was vitally alive again vitally glad with a cool tigerish joy She could have ground her heel into the gaping wound which had been his nose and taken sweet pleasure in the feel of his warm blood on her bare feet She had struck a blow of revenge for Taraand for Ellen There were hurried stumbling steps in the upper hall a pause and then more steps weak dragging steps now punctuated by metallic clankings A sense of time and reality coming back to her Scarlett looked up and saw Melanie at the top of the stairs clad only in the ragged chemise which served her as a nightgown her weak arm weighed down with Charles saber Melanies eyes took in the scene below in its entirety the sprawling blueclad body in the red pool the sewing box beside him Scarlett barefooted and grayfaced clutching the long pistol In silence her eyes met Scarletts There was a glow of grim pride in her usually gentle face approbation and a fierce joy in her smile that equaled the fiery tumult in Scarletts own bosom Whywhyshes like me She understands how I feel thought Scarlett in that long moment Shed have done the same thing With a thrill she looked up at the frail swaying girl for whom she had never had any feelings but of dislike and contempt Now straggling against hatred for Ashleys wife there surged a feeling of admiration and comradeship She saw in a flash of clarity untouched by any petty emotion that beneath the gentle voice and the dovelike eyes of Melanie there was a thin flashing blade of unbreakable steel felt too that there were banners and bugles of courage in Melanies quiet blood Scarlett Scarlett shrilled the weak frightened voices of Suellen and Carreen muffled by their closed door and Wades voice screamed Auntee Auntee Swiftly Melanie put her finger to her lips and laying the sword on the top step she painfully made her way down the upstairs hall and opened the door of the sick room Dont be scared chickens came her voice with teasing gaiety Your big sister was trying to clean the rust off Charles pistol and it went off and nearly scared her to death  Now Wade Hampton Mama just shot off your dear Papas pistol When you are bigger she will let you shoot it What a cool liar thought Scarlett with admiration I couldnt have thought that quickly But why lie Theyve got to know Ive done it She looked down at the body again and now revulsion came over her as her rage and fright melted away and her knees began to quiver with the reaction Melanie dragged herself to the top step again and started down holding onto the banisters her pale lower lip caught between her teeth Go back to bed silly youll kill yourself Scarlett cried but the halfnaked Melanie made her painful way down into the lower hall Scarlett she whispered we must get him out of here and bury him He may not be alone and if they find him here She steadied herself on Scarletts arm He must be alone said Scarlett I didnt see anyone else from the upstairs window He must be a deserter Even if he is alone no one must know about it The negroes might talk and then theyd come and get you Scarlett we must get him hidden before the folks come back from the swamp Her mind prodded to action by the feverish urgency of Melanies voice Scarlett thought hard I could bury him in the corner of the garden under the arborthe ground is soft there where Pork dug up the whisky barrel But how will I get him there Well both take a leg and drag him said Melanie firmly Reluctantly Scarletts admiration went still higher You couldnt drag a cat Ill drag him she said roughly You go back to bed Youll kill yourself Dont dare try to help me either or Ill carry you upstairs myself Melanies white face broke into a sweet understanding smile You are very dear Scarlett she said and softly brushed her lips against Scarletts cheek Before Scarlett could recover from her surprise Melanie went on If you can drag him out Ill mop up thethe mess before the folks get home and Scarlett Yes Do you suppose it would be dishonest to go through his knapsack He might have something to eat I do not said Scarlett annoyed that she had not thought of this herself You take the knapsack and Ill go through his pockets Stooping over the dead man with distaste she unbuttoned the remaining buttons of his jacket and systematically began rifling his pockets Dear God she whispered pulling out a bulging wallet wrapped about with a rag MelanieMelly I think its full of money Melanie said nothing but abruptly sat down on the floor and leaned back against the wall You look she said shakily Im feeling a little weak Scarlett tore off the rag and with trembling hands opened the leather folds Look Mellyjust look Melanie looked and her eyes dilated Jumbled together was a mass of bills United States greenbacks mingling with  Page    Gone With The Wind Confederate money and glinting from between them were one tendollar gold piece and two fivedollar gold pieces Dont stop to count it now said Melanie as Scarlett began fingering the bills We havent time Do you realize Melanie that this money means that well eat Yes yes dear I know but we havent time now You look in his other pockets and Ill take the knapsack Scarlett was loath to put down the wallet Bright vistas opened before herreal money the Yankees horse food There was a God after all and He did provide even if He did take very odd ways of providing She sat on her haunches and stared at the wallet smiling Food Melanie plucked it from her hands Hurry she said The trouser pockets yielded nothing except a candle end a jackknife a plug of tobacco and a bit of twine Melanie removed from the knapsack a small package of coffee which she sniffed as if it were the sweetest of perfumes hardtack and her face changing a miniature of a little girl in a gold frame set with seed pearls a garnet brooch two broad gold bracelets with tiny dangling gold chains a gold thimble a small silver babys cup gold embroidery scissors a diamond solitaire ring and a pair of earrings with pendant pearshaped diamonds which even their unpracticed eyes could tell were well over a carat each A thief whispered Melanie recoiling from the still body Scarlett he must have stolen all of this Of course said Scarlett And he came here hoping to steal more from us Im glad you killed him said Melanie her gentle eyes hard Now hurry darling and get him out of here Scarlett bent over caught the dead man by his boots and tugged How heavy he was and how weak she suddenly felt Suppose she shouldnt be able to move him Turning so that she backed the corpse she caught a heavy boot under each arm and threw her weight forward He moved and she jerked again Her sore foot forgotten in the excitement now gave a tremendous throb that made her grit her teeth and shift her weight to the heel Tugging and straining perspiration dripping from her forehead she dragged him down the hall a red stain following her path If he bleeds across the yard we cant hide it she gasped Give me your shimmy Melanie and Ill wad it around his head Melanies white face went crimson Dont be silly I wont look at you said Scarlett If I had on a petticoat or pantalets Id use them Crouching back against the wall Melanie pulled the ragged linen garment over her head and silently tossed it to Scarlett shielding herself as best she could with her arms Thank God Im not that modest thought Scarlett feeling rather than seeing Melanies agony of embarrassment as she wrapped the ragged cloth about the shattered face By a series of limping jerks she pulled the body down the hall toward the back porch and pausing to wipe her forehead with the back of her hand glanced back toward Melanie sitting against the wall hugging her thin knees to her bare breasts How silly of Melanie to be bothering about modesty at a time like this Scarlett thought irritably It was just part of her niceynice way of acting which had always made Scarlett despise her Then shame rose in her After allafter all Melanie had dragged herself from bed so soon after having a baby and had come to her aid with a weapon too heavy even for her to lift That had taken courage the kind of courage Scarlett honestly knew she herself did not possess the thinsteel spun silk courage which had characterized Melanie on the terrible night Atlanta fell and on the long trip home It was the same intangible unspectacular courage that all the Wilkeses possessed a quality which Scarlett did not understand but to which she gave grudging tribute Go back to bed she threw over her shoulder Youll be dead if you dont Ill clean up the mess after Ive buried him Ill do it with one of the rag rugs whispered Melanie looking at the pool of blood with a sick face Well kill yourself then and see if I care And if any of the folks come back before Im finished keep them in the house and tell them the horse just walked in from nowhere Melanie sat shivering in the morning sunlight and covered her ears against the sickening series of thuds as the dead mans head bumped down the porch steps No one questioned whence the horse had come It was so obvious he was a stray from the recent battle and they were well pleased to have him The Yankee lay in the shallow pit Scarlett had scraped out under the scuppernong arbor The uprights which held the thick vines were rotten and that night Scarlett hacked at them with the kitchen knife until they fell and the tangled mass ran wild over the grave The replacing of these posts was one bit of repair work Scarlett did not suggest and if the negroes knew why they kept their silence No ghost rose from that shallow grave to haunt her in the long nights when she lay awake too tired to sleep No feeling of horror or remorse assailed her at the memory She wondered why knowing that even a month before she could never have done the deed Pretty young Mrs Hamilton with her dimple and her jingling earbobs and her helpless little ways blowing a mans face to a pulp and then burying him in a hastily scratchedout hole Scarlett grinned a little grimly thinking of die consternation such an idea would bring to those who knew her I wont think about it any more she decided Its over and done with and Id have been a ninny not to kill him I reckonI reckon I must have changed a little since coming home or else I couldnt have done it She did not think of it consciously but in the back of her mind whenever she was confronted by an unpleasant and difficult task the idea lurked giving her strength Ive done murder and so I can surely do this She had changed more than she knew and the shell of hardness which had begun to form about her heart when she lay in the slave garden at Twelve Oaks was slowly thickening Now that she had a horse Scarlett could find out for herself what had happened to their neighbors Since she came home she had wondered despairingly a thousand times Are we the only folks left in the County Has everybody else been burned out Have they all refugeed to Macon With the memory of the ruins of Twelve Oaks the Macintosh place and the Slattery shack fresh in her mind she almost dreaded to discover the truth But it was better to know the worst than to wonder She decided to ride to the Fontaines first not because they were the nearest neighbors but because old Dr Fontaine might be there Melanie needed a doctor She was not recovering as she should and Scarlett was frightened by her white weakness  Page    Gone With The Wind So on the first day when her foot had healed enough to stand a slipper she mounted the Yankees horse One foot in the shortened stirrup and the other leg crooked about the pommel in an approximation of a side saddle she set out across the fields toward Mimosa steeling herself to find it burned To her surprise and pleasure she saw the faded yellowstucco house standing amid the mimosa trees looking as it had always looked Warm happiness happiness that almost brought tears flooded her when the three Fontaine women came out of the house to welcome her with kisses and cries of joy But when the first exclamations of affectionate greeting were over and they all had trooped into the dining room to sit down Scarlett felt a chill The Yankees had not reached Mimosa because it was far off the main road And so the Fontaines still had their stock and their provisions but Mimosa was held by the same strange silence that hung over Tara over the whole countryside All the slaves except four women house servants had run away frightened by the approach of the Yankees There was not a man on the place unless Sallys little boy Joe hardly out of diapers could be counted as a man Alone in the big house were Grandma Fontaine in her seventies her daughterinlaw who would always be known as Young Miss though she was in her fifties and Sally who had barely turned twenty They were far away from neighbors and unprotected but if they were afraid it did not show on their faces Probably thought Scarlett because Sally and Young Miss were too afraid of the porcelainfrail but indomitable old Grandma to dare voice any qualms Scarlett herself was afraid of the old lady for she had sharp eyes and a sharper tongue and Scarlett had felt them both in the past Though unrelated by blood and far apart in age there was a kinship of spirit and experience binding these women together All three wore homedyed mourning all were worn sad worried all bitter with a bitterness that did not sulk or complain but nevertheless peered out from behind their smiles and their words of welcome For their slaves were gone their money was worthless Sallys husband Joe had died at Gettysburg and Young Miss was also a widow for young Dr Fontaine had died of dysentery at Vicksburg The other two boys Alex and Tony were somewhere in Virginia and nobody knew whether they were alive or dead and old Dr Fontaine was off somewhere with Wheelers cavalry And the old fool is seventythree years old though he tries to act younger and hes as full of rheumatism as a hog is of fleas said Grandma proud of her husband the light in her eyes belying her sharp words Have you all had any news of whats been happening in Atlanta asked Scarlett when they were comfortably settled Were completely buried at Tara Law child said Old Miss taking charge of the conversation as was her habit were in the same fix as you are We dont know a thing except that Sherman finally got the town So he did get it Whats he doing now Wheres the fighting now And how would three lone women out here in the country know about the war when we havent seen a letter or a newspaper in weeks said the old lady tartly One of our darkies talked to a darky whod seen a darky whod been to Jonesboro and except for that we havent heard anything What they said was that the Yankees were just squatting in Atlanta resting up their men and their horses but whether its true or not youre as good a judge as I am Not that they wouldnt need a rest after the fight we gave them To think youve been at Tara all this time and we didnt know Young Miss broke in Oh how I blame myself for not riding over to see But theres been so much to do here with most all the darkies gone that I just couldnt get away But I should have made time to go It wasnt neighborly of me But of course we thought the Yankees had burned Tara like they did Twelve Oaks and the Macintosh house and that your folks had gone to Macon And we never dreamed you were home Scarlett Well how were we to know different when Mr OHaras darkies came through here so scared they were popeyed and told us the Yankees were going to burn Tara Grandma interrupted And we could see Sally began Im telling this please said Old Miss shortly And they said the Yankees were camped all over Tara and your folks were fixing to go to Macon And then that night we saw the glare of fire over toward Tara and it lasted for hours and it scared our fool darkies so bad they all ran off What burned All our cottona hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth said Scarlett bitterly Be thankful it wasnt your house said Grandma leaning her chin on her cane You can always grow more cotton and you cant grow a house By the bye had you all started picking your cotton No said Scarlett and now most of it is ruined I dont imagine theres more than three bales left standing in the far field in the creek bottom and what earthly good will it do All our field hands are gone and theres nobody to pick it Mercy me all our field hands are gone and theres nobody to pick it mimicked Grandma and bent a satiric glance on Scarlett Whats wrong with your own pretty paws Miss and those of your sisters Me Pick cotton cried Scarlett aghast as if Grandma had been suggesting some repulsive crime Like a field hand Like white trash Like the Slattery women White trash indeed Well isnt this generation soft and ladylike Let me tell you Miss when I was a girl my father lost all his money and I wasnt above doing honest work with my hands and in the fields too till Pa got enough money to buy some more darkies Ive hoed my row and Ive picked my cotton and I can do it again if I have to And it looks like Ill have to White trash indeed Oh but Mama Fontaine cried her daughterinlaw casting imploring glances at the two girls urging them to help her smooth the old ladys feathers That was so long ago a different day entirely and times have changed Times never change when theres a need for honest work to be done stated the sharpeyed old lady refusing to be soothed And Im ashamed for your mother Scarlett to hear you stand there and talk as though honest work made white trash out of nice people When Adam delved and Eve span To change the subject Scarlett hastily questioned What about the Tarletons and the Calverts Were they burned out Have they refugeed to Macon The Yankees never got to the Tarletons Theyre off the main road like we are but they did get to the Calverts and they stole  Page    Gone With The Wind all their stock and poultry and got all the darkies to run off with them Sally began Grandma interrupted Hah They promised all the black wenches silk dresses and gold earbobsthats what they did And Cathleen Calvert said some of the troopers went off with the black fools behind them on their saddles Well all theyll get will be yellow babies and I cant say that Yankee blood will improve the stock Oh Mama Fontaine Dont pull such a shocked face Jane Were all married arent we And God knows weve seen mulatto babies before this Why didnt they burn the Calverts house The house was saved by the combined accents of the second Mrs Calvert and that Yankee overseer of hers Hilton said Old Miss who always referred to the exgoverness as the second Mrs Calvert although the first Mrs Calvert had been dead twenty years  We are staunch Union sympathizers  mimicked the old lady twanging the words through her long thin nose Cathleen said the two of them swore up hill and down dale that the whole passel of Calverts were Yankees And Mr Calvert dead in the Wilderness And Raiford at Gettysburg and Cade in Virginia with the army Cathleen was so mortified she said shed rather the house had been burned She said Cade would bust when he came home and heard about it But then thats what a man gets for marrying a Yankee womanno pride no decency always thinking about their own skins  How come they didnt burn Tara Scarlett For a moment Scarlett paused before answering She knew the very next question would be And how are all your folks And how is your dear mother She knew she could not tell them Ellen was dead She knew that if she spoke those words or even let herself think of them in the presence of these sympathetic women she would burst into a storm of tears and cry until she was sick And she could not let herself cry She had not really cried since she came home and she knew that if she once let down the floodgates her closely husbanded courage would all be gone But she knew too looking with confusion at the friendly faces about her that if she withheld the news of Ellens death the Fontaines would never forgive her Grandma in particular was devoted to Ellen and there were very few people in the County for whom the old lady gave a snap of her skinny fingers Well speak up said Grandma looking sharply at her Dont you know Miss Well you see I didnt get home till the day after the battle she answered hastily The Yankees were all gone then Pa Pa told me thatthat he got them not to burn the house because Suellen and Carreen were so ill with typhoid they couldnt be moved Thats the first time I ever heard of a Yankee doing a decent thing said Grandma as if she regretted hearing anything good about the invaders And how are the girls now Oh they are better much better almost well but quite weak answered Scarlett Then seeing the question she feared hovering on the old ladys lips she cast hastily about for some other topic of conversation II wonder if you could lend us something to eat The Yankees cleaned us out like a swarm of locusts But if you are on short rations just tell me so plainly and Send over Pork with a wagon and you shall have half of what weve got rice meal ham some chickens said Old Miss giving Scarlett a sudden keen look Oh thats too much Really I Not a word I wont hear it What are neighbors for You are so kind that I cant But I have to be going now The folks at home will be worrying about me Grandma rose abruptly and took Scarlett by the arm You two stay here she commanded pushing Scarlett toward the back porch I have a private word for this child Help me down the steps Scarlett Young Miss and Sally said goodby and promised to come calling soon They were devoured by curiosity as to what Grandma had to say to Scarlett but unless she chose to tell them they would never know Old ladies were so difficult Young Miss whispered to Sally as they went back to their sewing Scarlett stood with her hand on the horses bridle a dull feeling at her heart Now said Grandma peering into her face whats wrong at Tara What are you keeping back Scarlett looked up into the keen old eyes and knew she could tell the truth without tears No one could cry in the presence of Grandma Fontaine without her express permission Mother is dead she said flatly The hand on her arm tightened until it pinched and the wrinkled lids over the yellow eyes blinked Did the Yankees kill her She died of typhoid Diedthe day before I came home Dont think about it said Grandma sternly and Scarlett saw her swallow And your Pa Pa isPa is not himself What do you mean Speak up Is he ill The shockhe is so strangehe is not Dont tell me hes not himself Do you mean his mind is unhinged It was a relief to hear the truth put so baldly How good the old lady was to offer no sympathy that would make her cry Yes she said dully hes lost his mind He acts dazed and sometimes he cant seem to remember that Mother is dead Oh Old Miss its more than I can stand to see him sit by the hour waiting for her and so patiently too and he used to have no more patience than a child But its worse when he does remember that shes gone Every now and then after hes sat still with his ear cocked listening for her he jumps up suddenly and stamps out of the house and down to the burying ground And then he comes dragging back with the tears all over his face and he says over and over till I could scream Katie Scarlett Mrs OHara is dead Your mother is dead and its just like I was hearing it again for the first time And sometimes late at night I hear him calling her  Page    Gone With The Wind and I get out of bed and go to him and tell him shes down at the quarters with a sick darky And he fusses because shes always tiring herself out nursing people And its so hard to get him back to bed Hes like a child Oh I wish Dr Fontaine was here I know he could do something for Pa And Melanie needs a doctor too She isnt getting over her baby like she should Mellya baby And shes with you Yes Whats Melly doing with you Why isnt she in Macon with her aunt and her kinfolks I never thought you liked her any too well Miss for all she was Charles sister Now tell me all about it Its a long story Old Miss Dont you want to go back in the house and sit down I can stand said Grandma shortly And if you told your story in front of the others theyd be bawling and making you feel sorry for yourself Now lets have it Scarlett began haltingly with the siege and Melanies condition but as her story progressed beneath the sharp old eyes which never faltered in their gaze she found words words of power and horror It all came back to her the sickeningly hot day of the babys birth the agony of fear the flight and Rhetts desertion She spoke of the wild darkness of the night the blazing camp fires which might be friends or foes the gaunt chimneys which met her gaze in the morning sun the dead men and horses along the road the hunger the desolation the fear that Tara had been burned I thought if I could just get home to Mother she could manage everything and I could lay down the weary load On the way home I thought the worst had already happened to me but when I knew she was dead I knew what the worst really was She dropped her eyes to the ground and waited for Grandma to speak The silence was so prolonged she wondered if Grandma could have failed to comprehend her desperate plight Finally the old voice spoke and her tones were kind kinder than Scarlett had ever heard her use in addressing anyone Child its a very bad thing for a woman to face the worst that can happen to her because after shes faced the worst she cant ever really fear anything again And its very bad for a woman not to be afraid of something You think I dont understand what youve told mewhat youve been through Well I understand very well When I was about your age I was in the Creek uprising right after the Fort Mims massacreyes she said in a faraway voice just about your age for that was fiftyodd years ago And I managed to get into the bushes and hide and I lay there and saw our house burn and I saw the Indians scalp my brothers and sisters And I could only lie there and pray that the light of the flames wouldnt show up my hiding place And they dragged Mother out and killed her about twenty feet from where I was lying And scalped her too And ever so often one Indian would go back to her and sink his tommyhawk into her skull again II was my mothers pet and I lay there and saw it all And in the morning I set out for the nearest settlement and it was thirty miles away It took me three days to get there through the swamps and the Indians and afterward they thought Id lose my mind  Thats where I met Dr Fontaine He looked after me  Ah well thats been fifty years ago as I said and since that time Ive never been afraid of anything or anybody because Id known the worst that could happen to me And that lack of fear has gotten me into a lot of trouble and cost me a lot of happiness God intended women to be timid frightened creatures and theres something unnatural about a woman who isnt afraid  Scarlett always save something to fear even as you save something to love  Her voice trailed off and she stood silent with eyes looking back over half a century to the day when she had been afraid Scarlett moved impatiently She had thought Grandma was going to understand and perhaps show her some way to solve her problems But like all old people shed gotten to talking about things that happened before anyone was born things no one was interested in Scarlett wished she had not confided in her Well go home child or theyll be worrying about you she said suddenly Send Pork with the wagon this afternoon  And dont think you can lay down the load ever Because you cant I know Indian summer lingered into November that year and the warm days were bright days for those at Tara The worst was over They had a horse now and they could ride instead of walk They had fried eggs for breakfast and fried ham for supper to vary the monotony of the yams peanuts and dried apples and on one festal occasion they even had roast chicken The old sow had finally been captured and she and her brood rooted and grunted happily under the house where they were penned Sometimes they squealed so loudly no one in the house could talk but it was a pleasant sound It meant fresh pork for the white folks and chitterlings for the negroes when cold weather and hogkilling time should arrive and it meant food for the winter for all Scarletts visit to the Fontaines had heartened her more than she realized Just the knowledge that she had neighbors that some of the family friends and old homes had survived drove out the terrible loss and alone feeling which had oppressed her in her first weeks at Tara And the Fontaines and Tarletons whose plantations had not been in the path of the army were most generous in sharing what little they had It was the tradition of the County that neighbor helped neighbor and they refused to accept a penny from Scarlett telling her that she would do the same for them and she could pay them back in kind next year when Tara was again producing Scarlett now had food for her household she had a horse she had the money and jewelry taken from the Yankee straggler and the greatest need was new clothing She knew it would be risky business sending Pork south to buy clothes when the horse might be captured by either Yankees or Confederates But at least she had the money with which to buy the clothes a horse and wagon for the trip and perhaps Pork could make the trip without getting caught Yes the worst was over Every morning when Scarlett arose she thanked God for the paleblue sky and the warm sun for each day of good weather put off the inevitable time when warm clothing would be needed And each warm day saw more and more cotton piling up in the empty slave quarters the only storage place left on the plantation There was more cotton in the fields than she or Pork had estimated probably four bales and soon the cabins would be full Scarlett had not intended to do any cotton picking herself even after Grandma Fontaines tart remark It was unthinkable that she an OHara lady now the mistress of Tara should work in the fields It put her on the same level with the snarly haired Mrs Slattery and Emmie She had intended that the negroes should do the field work while she and the convalescent girls attended to the house but here she was confronted with a caste feeling even stronger than her own Pork Mammy and Prissy set up outcries  Page    Gone With The Wind at the idea of working in the fields They reiterated that they were house niggers not field hands Mammy in particular declared vehemently that she had never even been a yard nigger She had been born in the Robillard great house not in the quarters and had been raised in Ole Miss bedroom sleeping on a pallet at the foot of the bed Dilcey alone said nothing and she fixed her Prissy with an unwinking eye that made her squirm Scarlett refused to listen to the protests and drove them all into the cotton rows But Mammy and Pork worked so slowly and with so many lamentations that Scarlett sent Mammy back to the kitchen to cook and Pork to the woods and the river with snares for rabbits and possums and lines for fish Cotton picking was beneath Porks dignity but hunting and fishing were not Scarlett next had tried her sisters and Melanie in the fields but that had worked no better Melanie had picked neatly quickly and willingly for an hour in the hot sun and then fainted quietly and had to stay in bed for a week Suellen sullen and tearful pretended to faint too but came back to consciousness spitting like an angry cat when Scarlett poured a gourdful of water in her face Finally she refused pointblank I wont work in the fields like a darky You cant make me What if any of our friends ever heard of it What ifif Mr Kennedy ever knew Oh if Mother knew about this You just mention Mothers name once more Suellen OHara and Ill slap you flat cried Scarlett Mother worked harder than any darky on this place and you know it Miss Fine Airs She did not At least not in the fields And you cant make me Ill tell Papa on you and he wont make me work Dont you dare go bothering Pa with any of our troubles cried Scarlett distracted between indignation at her sister and fear for Gerald Ill help you Sissy interposed Carreen docilely Ill work for Sue and me too She isnt well yet and she shouldnt be out in the sun Scarlett said gratefully Thank you Sugarbaby but looked worriedly at her younger sister Carreen who had always been as delicately pink and white as the orchard blossoms that are scattered by the spring wind was no longer pink but still conveyed in her sweet thoughtful face a blossomlike quality She had been silent a little dazed since she came back to consciousness and found Ellen gone Scarlett a termagant the world changed and unceasing labor the order of the new day It was not in Carreens delicate nature to adjust herself to change She simply could not comprehend what had happened and she went about Tara like a sleepwalker doing exactly what she was told She looked and was frail but she was willing obedient and obliging When she was not doing Scarletts bidding her rosary beads were always in her hands and her lips moving in prayers for her mother and for Brent Tarleton It did not occur to Scarlett that Carreen had taken Brents death so seriously and that her grief was unhealed To Scarlett Carreen was still baby sister far too young to have had a really serious love affair Scarlett standing in the sun in the cotton rows her back breaking from the eternal bending and her hands roughened by the dry bolls wished she had a sister who combined Suellens energy and strength with Carreens sweet disposition For Carreen picked diligently and earnestly But after she had labored for an hour it was obvious that she and not Suellen was the one not yet well enough for such work So Scarlett sent Carreen back to the house too There remained with her now in the long rows only Dilcey and Prissy Prissy picked lazily spasmodically complaining of her feet her back her internal miseries her complete weariness until her mother took a cotton stalk to her and whipped her until she screamed After that she worked a little better taking care to stay far from her mothers reach Dilcey worked tirelessly silently like a machine and Scarlett with her back aching and her shoulder raw from the tugging weight of the cotton bag she carried thought that Dilcey was worth her weight in gold Dilcey she said when good times come back Im not going to forget how youve acted Youve been mighty good The bronze giantess did not grin pleasedly or squirm under praise like the other negroes She turned an immobile face to Scarlett and said with dignity Thankee Mam But Mist Gerald and Miss Ellen been good to me Mist Gerald buy my Prissy so I wouldn grieve and I doan forgit it I is part Indian and Indians doan forgit them as is good to them I sorry bout my Prissy She mighty worthless Look lak she all nigger lak her pa Her pa was mighty flighty In spite of Scarletts problem of getting help from the others in the picking and in spite of the weariness of doing the labor herself her spirits lifted as the cotton slowly made its way from the fields to the cabins There was something about cotton that was reassuring steadying Tara had risen to riches on cotton even as the whole South had risen and Scarlett was Southerner enough to believe that both Tara and the South would rise again out of the red fields Of course this little cotton she had gathered was not much but it was something It would bring a little in Confederate money and that little would help her to save the hoarded greenbacks and gold in the Yankees wallet until they had to be spent Next spring she would try to make the Confederate government send back Big Sam and the other field hands they had commandeered and if the government wouldnt release them shed use the Yankees money to hire field hands from the neighbors Next spring she would plant and plant  She straightened her tired back and looking over the browning autumn fields she saw next years crop standing sturdy and green acre upon acre Next spring Perhaps by next spring the war would be over and good times would be back And whether the Confederacy won or lost times would be better Anything was better than the constant danger of raids from both armies When the war was over a plantation could earn an honest living Oh if the war were only over Then people could plant crops with some certainty of reaping them There was hope now The war couldnt last forever She had her little cotton she had food she had a horse she had her small but treasured hoard of money Yes the worst was over CHAPTER XXVII ON A NOONDAY in midNovember they all sat grouped about the dinner table eating the last of the dessert concocted by Mammy from corn meal and dried huckleberries sweetened with sorghum There was a chill in the air the first chill of the year and Pork standing behind Scarletts chair rubbed his hands together in glee and questioned Ain it bout time fer de hawg  Page    Gone With The Wind killin Miss Scarlett You can taste those chitlins already cant you said Scarlett with a grin Well I can taste fresh pork myself and if the weather holds for a few days more well Melanie interrupted her spoon at her lips Listen dear Somebodys coming Somebody hollerin said Pork uneasily On the crisp autumn air came clear the sound of horses hooves thudding as swiftly as a frightened heart and a womans voice high pitched screaming Scarlett Scarlett Eye met eye for a dreadful second around the table before chairs were pushed back and everyone leaped up Despite the fear that made it shrill they recognized the voice of Sally Fontaine who only an hour before had stopped at Tara for a brief chat on her way to Jonesboro Now as they all rushed pellmell to crowd the front door they saw her coming up the drive like the wind on a lathered horse her hair streaming behind her her bonnet dangling by its ribbons She did not draw rein but as she galloped madly toward them she waved her arm back in the direction from which she had come The Yankees are coming I saw them Down the road The Yankees She sawed savagely at the horses mouth just in time to swerve him from leaping up the front steps He swung around sharply covered the side lawn in three leaps and she put him across the fourfoot hedge as if she were on the hunting field They heard the heavy pounding of his hooves as he went through the back yard and down the narrow lane between the cabins of the quarters and knew she was cutting across the fields to Mimosa For a moment they stood paralyzed and then Suellen and Carreen began to sob and clutch each others fingers Little Wade stood rooted trembling unable to cry What he had feared since the night he left Atlanta had happened The Yankees were coming to get him Yankees said Gerald vaguely But the Yankees have already been here Mother of God cried Scarlett her eyes meeting Melanies frightened eyes For a swift instant there went through her memory again the horrors of her last night in Atlanta the ruined homes that dotted the countryside all the stories of rape and torture and murder She saw again the Yankee soldier standing in the hall with Ellens sewing box in his hand She thought I shall die I shall die right here I thought we were through with all that I shall die I cant stand any more Then her eyes fell on the horse saddled and hitched and waiting for Pork to ride him to the Tarleton place on an errand Her horse Her only horse The Yankees would take him and the cow and the calf And the sow and her litter Oh how many tiring hours it had taken to catch that sow and her agile young And theyd take the rooster and the setting hens and the ducks the Fontaines had given her And the apples and the yams in the pantry bins And the flour and rice and dried peas And the money in the Yankee soldiers wallet Theyd take everything and leave them to starve They shant have them she cried aloud and they all turned startled faces to her fearful her mind had cracked under the tidings I wont go hungry They shant have them What is it Scarlett What is it The horse The cow The pigs They shant have them I wont let them have them She turned swiftly to the four negroes who huddled in the doorway their black faces a peculiarly ashen shade The swamp she said rapidly Whut swamp The river swamp you fools Take the pigs to the swamp All of you Quickly Pork you and Prissy crawl under the house and get the pigs out Suellen you and Carreen fill the baskets with as much food as you can carry and get to the woods Mammy put the silver in the well again And Pork Pork listen to me dont stand there like that Take Pa with you Dont ask me where Any where Go with Pork Pa Thats a sweet pa Even in her frenzy she thought what the sight of bluecoats might do to Geralds wavering mind She stopped and wrung her hands and the frightened sobbing of little Wade who was clutching Melanies skirt added to her panic What shall I do Scarlett Melanies voice was calm amid the wailing and tears and scurrying feet Though her face was paper white and her whole body trembled the very quietness of her voice steadied Scarlett revealing to her that they all looked to her for commands for guidance The cow and the calf she said quickly Theyre in the old pasture Take the horse and drive them into the swamp and Before she could finish her sentence Melanie shook off Wades clutches and was down the front steps and running toward the horse pulling up her wide skirts as she ran Scarlett caught a flashing glimpse of thin legs a flurry of skirts and underclothing and Melanie was in the saddle her feet dangling far above the stirrups She gathered up the reins and clapped her heels against the animals sides and then abruptly pulled him in her face twisting with horror My baby she cried Oh my baby The Yankees will kill him Give him to me Her hand was on the pommel and she was preparing to slide off but Scarlett screamed at her Go on Go on Get the cow Ill look after the baby Go on I tell you Do you think Id let them get Ashleys baby Go on Melly looked despairingly backward but hammered her heels into the horse and with a scattering of gravel was off down the drive toward the pasture Scarlett thought I never expected to see Melly Hamilton straddling a horse and then she ran into the house Wade was at her heels sobbing trying to catch her flying skirts As she went up the steps three at a bound she saw Suellen and Carreen with splitoak baskets on their arms running toward the pantry and Pork tugging none too gently at Geralds arm dragging him toward the back porch Gerald was mumbling querulously and pulling away like a child From the back yard she heard Mammys strident voice You Priss You git unner dat house an han me dem shoats You knows mighty well Ahs too big ter crawl thoo dem lattices Dilcey comyere an mek dis wuthless chile And I thought it was such a good idea to keep the pigs under the house so nobody could steal them thought Scarlett running into her room Why oh why didnt I build a pen for them down in the swamp  Page    Gone With The Wind She tore open her top bureau drawer and scratched about in the clothing until the Yankees wallet was in her hand Hastily she picked up the solitaire ring and the diamond earbobs from where she had hidden them in her sewing basket and shoved them into the wallet But where to hide it In the mattress Up the chimney Throw it in the well Put it in her bosom No never there The outlines of the wallet might show through her basque and if the Yankees saw it they would strip her naked and search her I shall die if they do she thought wildly Downstairs there was a pandemonium of racing feet and sobbing voices Even in her frenzy Scarlett wished she had Melanie with her Melly with her quiet voice Melly who was so brave the day she shot the Yankee Melly was worth three of the others Mellywhat had Melly said Oh yes the baby Clutching the wallet to her Scarlett ran across the hall to the room where little Beau was sleeping in the low cradle She snatched him up into her arms and he awoke waving small fists and slobbering sleepily She heard Suellen crying Come on Carreen Come on Weve got enough Oh Sister hurry There were wild squealings indignant gruntings in the back yard and running to the window Scarlett saw Mammy waddling hurriedly across the cotton field with a struggling young pig under each arm Behind her was Pork also carrying two pigs and pushing Gerald before him Gerald was stumping across the furrows waving his cane Leaning out of the window Scarlett yelled Get the sow Dilcey Make Prissy drive her out You can chase her across the fields Dilcey looked up her bronzed face harassed In her apron was a pile of silver tableware She pointed under the house The sow done bit Prissy and got her penned up unner the house Good for the sow thought Scarlett She hurried back into her room and hastily gathered from their hiding place the bracelets brooch miniature and cup she had found on the dead Yankee But where to hide them It was awkward carrying little Beau in one arm and the wallet and the trinkets in the other She started to lay him on the bed He set up a wail at leaving her arms and a welcome thought came to her What better hiding place could there be than a babys diaper She quickly turned him over pulled up his dress and thrust the wallet down the diaper next to his backside He yelled louder at this treatment and she hastily tightened the triangular garment about his threshing legs Now she thought drawing a deep breath now for the swamp Tucking him screaming under one arm and clutching the jewelry to her with the other she raced into the upstairs hall Suddenly her rapid steps paused fright weakening her knees How silent the house was How dreadfully still Had they all gone off and left her Hadnt anyone waited for her She hadnt meant for them to leave her here alone These days anything could happen to a lone woman and with the Yankees coming She jumped as a slight noise sounded and turning quickly saw crouched by the banisters her forgotten son his eyes enormous with terror He tried to speak but his throat only worked silently Get up Wade Hampton she commanded swiftly Get up and walk Mother cant carry you now He ran to her like a small frightened animal and clutching her wide skirt buried his face in it She could feel his small hands groping through the folds for her legs She started down the stairs each step hampered by Wades dragging hands and she said fiercely Turn me loose Wade Turn me loose and walk But the child only clung the closer As she reached the landing the whole lower floor leaped up at her All the homely wellloved articles of furniture seemed to whisper Goodby Goodby A sob rose in her throat There was the open door of the office where Ellen had labored so diligently and she could glimpse a corner of the old secretary There was the dining room with chairs pushed awry and food still on the plates There on the floor were the rag rugs Ellen had dyed and woven herself And there was the old portrait of Grandma Robillard with bosoms half bared hair piled high and nostrils cut so deeply as to give her face a perpetual wellbred sneer Everything which had been part of her earliest memories everything bound up with the deepest roots in her Goodby Goodby Scarlett OHara The Yankees would burn it allall This was her last view of home her last view except what she might see from the cover of the woods or the swamp the tall chimneys wrapped in smoke the roof crashing in flame I cant leave you she thought and her teeth chattered with fear I cant leave you Pa wouldnt leave you He told them theyd have to burn you over his head Then theyll burn you over my head for I cant leave you either Youre all Ive got left With the decision some of her fear fell away and there remained only a congealed feeling in her breast as if all hope and fear had frozen As she stood there she heard from the avenue the sound of many horses feet the jingle of bridle bits and sabers rattling in scabbards and a harsh voice crying a command Dismount Swiftly she bent to the child beside her and her voice was urgent but oddly gentle Turn me loose Wade honey You run down the stairs quick and through the back yard toward the swamp Mammy will be there and Aunt Melly Run quickly darling and dont be afraid At the change in her tone the boy looked up and Scarlett was appalled at the look in his eyes like a baby rabbit in a trap Oh Mother of God she prayed Dont let him have a convulsion Notnot before the Yankees They mustnt know we are afraid And as the child only gripped her skirt the tighter she said clearly Be a little man Wade Theyre only a passel of damn Yankees And she went down the steps to meet them Sherman was marching through Georgia from Atlanta to the sea Behind him lay the smoking ruins of Atlanta to which the torch had been set as the blue army tramped out Before him lay three hundred miles of territory virtually undefended save by a few state militia and the old men and young boys of the Home Guard Here lay the fertile state dotted with plantations sheltering the women and children the very old and the negroes In a swath eighty miles wide the Yankees were looting and burning There were hundreds of homes in flames hundreds of homes resounding with their footsteps But to Scarlett watching the bluecoats pour into the front hall it was not a countrywide affair It  Page    Gone With The Wind was entirely personal a malicious action aimed directly at her and hers She stood at the foot of the stairs the baby in her arms Wade pressed tightly against her his head hidden in her skirts as the Yankees swarmed through the house pushing roughly past her up the stairs dragging furniture onto the front porch running bayonets and knives into upholstery and digging inside for concealed valuables Upstairs they were ripping open mattresses and feather beds until the air in the hall was thick with feathers that floated softly down on her head Impotent rage quelled what little fear was left in her heart as she stood helpless while they plundered and stole and ruined The sergeant in charge was a bowlegged grizzled little man with a large wad of tobacco in his cheek He reached Scarlett before any of his men and spitting freely on the floor and her skirts said briefly Lemme have what you got in yore hand lady She had forgotten the trinkets she had intended to hide and with a sneer which she hoped was as eloquent as that pictured on Grandma Robillards face she flung the articles to the floor and almost enjoyed the rapacious scramble that ensued Ill trouble you for thet ring and them earbobs Scarlett tucked the baby more securely under her arm so that he hung face downward crimson and screaming and removed the garnet earrings which had been Geralds wedding present to Ellen Then she stripped off the large sapphire solitaire which Charles had given her as an engagement ring Dont throw um Hand um to me said the sergeant putting out his hands Them bastards got enough already What else have you got His eyes went over her basque sharply For a moment Scarlett went faint already feeling rough hands thrusting themselves into her bosom fumbling at her garters That is all but I suppose it is customary to strip your victims Oh Ill take your word said the sergeant good naturedly spitting again as he turned away Scarlett righted the baby and tried to soothe him holding her hand over the place on the diaper where the wallet was hidden thanking God that Melanie had a baby and that baby had a diaper Upstairs she could hear heavy boots trampling the protesting screech of furniture pulled across the floor the crashing of china and mirrors the curses when nothing of value appeared From the yard came loud cries Head um off Dont let um get away and the despairing squawks of the hens and quacking and honking of the ducks and geese A pang went through her as she heard an agonized squealing which was suddenly stilled by a pistol shot and she knew that the sow was dead Damn Prissy She had run off and left her If only the shoats were safe If only the family had gotten safely to the swamp But there was no way of knowing She stood quietly in the hall while the soldiers boiled about her shouting and cursing Wades fingers were in her skirt in a terrified grip She could feel his body shaking as he pressed against her but she could not bring herself to speak reassuringly to him She could not bring herself to utter any word to the Yankees either of pleading protest or anger She could only thank God that her knees still had the strength to support her that her neck was still strong enough to hold her head high But when a squad of bearded men came lumbering down the steps laden with an assortment of stolen articles and she saw Charles sword in the hands of one she did cry out That sword was Wades It had been his fathers and his grandfathers sword and Scarlett had given it to the little boy on his last birthday They had made quite a ceremony of it and Melanie had cried cried with tears of pride and sorrowful memory and kissed him and said he must grow up to be a brave soldier like his father and his grandfather Wade was very proud of it and often climbed upon the table beneath where it hung to pat it Scarlett could endure seeing her own possessions going out of the house in hateful alien hands but not thisnot her little boys pride Wade peering from the protection of her skirts at the sound of her cry found speech and courage in a mighty sob Stretching out one hand he cried Mine You cant take that said Scarlett swiftly holding out her hand too I cant hey said the little soldier who held it grinning impudently at her Well I can Its a Rebel sword Itsits not Its a Mexican War sword You cant take it Its my little boys It was his grandfathers Oh Captain she cried turning to the sergeant please make him give it to me The sergeant pleased at his promotion stepped forward Lemme see thet sword Bub he said Reluctantly the little trooper handed it to him Its got a solidgold hilt he said The sergeant turned it in his hand held the hilt up to the sunlight to read the engraved inscription  To Colonel William R Hamilton  he deciphered  From His Staff For Gallantry Buena Vista   Ho lady he said I was at Buena Vista myself Indeed said Scarlett icily Was I Thet was hot fightin lemme tell you I aint seen such hot fightin in this war as we seen in thet one So this sword was this little tykes grandaddys Yes Well he can have it said the sergeant who was satisfied enough with the jewelry and trinkets tied up in his handkerchief But its got a solidgold hilt insisted the little trooper Well leave her thet to remember us by grinned the sergeant Scarlett took the sword not even saying Thank you Why should she thank these thieves for returning her own property to her She held the sword against her while the little cavalryman argued and wrangled with the sergeant By God Ill give these damn Rebels something to remember me by shouted the private finally when the sergeant losing his good nature told him to go to hell and not talk back The little man went charging toward the back of the house and Scarlett breathed more easily They had said nothing about burning the house They hadnt told her to leave so they could fire it Perhapsperhaps The men came rambling into the hall from the upstairs and the out of doors Anything questioned the sergeant One hog and a few chickens and ducks Some corn and a few yams and beans That wildcat we saw on the horse must have given the alarm all right  Page    Gone With The Wind Regular Paul Revere eh Well there aint much here Sarge You got the pickins Lets move on before the whole country gets the news were comin Didja dig under the smokehouse They generally buries things there Aint no smokehouse Didja dig in the nigger cabins Nothin but cotton in the cabins We set fire to it For a brief instant Scarlett saw the long hot days in the cotton field felt again the terrible ache in her back the raw bruised flesh of her shoulders All for nothing The cotton was gone You aint got much for a fac have you lady Your army has been here before she said coolly Thats a fac We were in this neighborhood in September said one of the men turning something in his hand Id forgot Scarlett saw it was Ellens gold thimble that he held How often she had seen it gleaming in and out of Ellens fancy work The sight of it brought back too many hurting memories of the slender hand which had worn it There it lay in this strangers calloused duly palm and soon it would find its way North and onto the finger of some Yankee woman who would be proud to wear stolen things Ellens thimble Scarlett dropped her head so the enemy could not see her cry and the tears fell slowly down on the babys head Through the blur she saw the men moving toward the doorway heard the sergeant calling commands in a loud rough voice They were going and Tara was safe but with the pain of Ellens memory on her she was hardly glad The sound of the banging sabers and horses hooves brought little relief and she stood suddenly weak and nerveless as they moved off down the avenue every man laden with stolen goods clothing blankets pictures hens and ducks the sow Then to her nostrils was borne the smell of smoke and she turned too weak with lessening strain to care about the cotton Through the open windows of the dining room she saw smoke drifting lazily out of the negro cabins There went the cotton There went the tax money and part of the money which was to see them through this bitter winter There was nothing she could do about it either except watch She had seen fires in cotton before and she knew how difficult they were to put out even with many men laboring at it Thank God the quarters were so far from the house Thank God there was no wind today to carry sparks to the roof of Tara Suddenly she swung about rigid as a pointer and stared with horrorstruck eyes down the hall down the covered passageway toward the kitchen There was smoke coming from the kitchen Somewhere between the hall and the kitchen she laid the baby down Somewhere she flung off Wades grip slinging him against the wall She burst into the smokefilled kitchen and reeled back coughing her eyes streaming tears from the smoke Again she plunged in her skirt held over her nose The room was dark lit as it was by one small window and so thick with smoke that she was blinded but she could hear the hiss and crackle of flames Dashing a hand across her eyes she peered squinting and saw thin lines of flame creeping across the kitchen floor toward the walls Someone had scattered the blazing logs in the open fireplace across the whole room and the tinderdry pine floor was sucking in the flames and spewing them up like water Back she rushed to the dining room and snatched a rag rug from the floor spilling two chairs with a crash Ill never beat it outnever never Oh God if only there was someone to help Tara is gonegone Oh God This was what that little wretch meant when he said hed give me something to remember him by Oh if Id only let him have the sword In the hallway she passed her son lying in the corner with his sword His eyes were closed and his face had a look of slack unearthly peace My God Hes dead Theyve frightened him to death she thought in agony but she raced by him to the bucket of drinking water which always stood in the passageway by the kitchen door She soused the end of the rug into the bucket and drawing a deep breath plunged again into the smokefilled room slamming the door behind her For an eternity she reeled and coughed beating the rug against the lines of fire that shot swiftly beyond her Twice her long skirt took fire and she slapped it out with her hands She could smell the sickening smell of her hair scorching as it came loose from its pins and swept about her shoulders The flames raced ever beyond her toward the walls of the covered runway fiery snakes that writhed and leaped and exhaustion sweeping her she knew that it was hopeless Then the door swung open and the sucking draft flung the flames higher It closed with a bang and in the swirling smoke Scarlett half blind saw Melanie stamping her feet on the flames beating at them with something dark and heavy She saw her staggering heard her coughing caught a lightningflash glimpse of her set white face and eyes narrow to slits against the smoke saw her small body curving back and forth as she swung her rug up and down For another eternity they fought and swayed side by side and Scarlett could see that the lines of fire were shortening Then suddenly Melanie turned toward her and with a cry hit her across the shoulders with all her might Scarlett went down in a whirlwind of smoke and darkness When she opened her eyes she was lying on the back porch her head pillowed comfortably on Melanies lap and the afternoon sunlight was shining on her face Her hands face and shoulders smarted intolerably from burns Smoke was still rolling from the quarters enveloping the cabins in thick clouds and the smell of burning cotton was strong Scarlett saw wisps of smoke drifting from the kitchen and she stirred frantically to rise But she was pushed back as Melanies calm voice said Lie still dear The fires out She lay quiet for a moment eyes closed sighing with relief and heard the slobbery gurgle of the baby near by and the reassuring sound of Wades hiccoughing So he wasnt dead thank God She opened her eyes and looked up into Melanies face Her curls were singed her face black with smut but her eyes were sparkling with excitement and she was smiling You look like a nigger murmured Scarlett burrowing her head wearily into its soft pillow And you look like the end man in a minstrel show replied Melanie equably Why did you have to hit me Because my darling your back was on fire I didnt dream youd faint though the Lord knows youve had enough today to  Page    Gone With The Wind kill you  I came back as soon as I got the stock safe in the woods I nearly died thinking about you and the baby alone Didthe Yankees harm you If you mean did they rape me no said Scarlett groaning as she tried to sit up Though Melanies lap was soft the porch on which she was lying was far from comfortable But theyve stolen everything everything Weve lost everything Well what is there to look so happy about We havent lost each other and our babies are all right and we have a roof over our heads said Melanie and there was a lilt in her voice And thats all anyone can hope for now  Goodness but Beau is wet I suppose the Yankees even stole his extra diapers He Scarlett what on earth is in his diaper She thrust a suddenly frightened hand down the babys back and brought up the wallet For a moment she looked at it as if she had never seen it before and then she began to laugh peal on peal of mirth that had in it no hint of hysteria Nobody but you would ever have thought of it she cried and flinging her arms around Scarletts neck she kissed her You are the beatenest sister I ever had Scarlett permitted the embrace because she was too tired to struggle because the words of praise brought balm to her spirit and because in the dark smokefilled kitchen there had been born a greater respect for her sisterinlaw a closer feeling of comradeship Ill say this for her she thought grudgingly shes always there when you need her CHAPTER XXVIII COLD WEATHER set in abruptly with a killing frost Chilling winds swept beneath the doorsills and rattled the loose windowpanes with a monotonous tinkling sound The last of the leaves fell from the bare trees and only the pines stood clothed black and cold against pale skies The rutted red roads were frozen to flintiness and hunger rode the winds through Georgia Scarlett recalled bitterly her conversation with Grandma Fontaine On that afternoon two months ago which now seemed years in the past she had told the old lady she had already known the worst which could possibly happen to her and she had spoken from the bottom of her heart Now that remark sounded like schoolgirl hyperbole Before Shermans men came through Tara the second time she had her small riches of food and money she had neighbors more fortunate than she and she had the cotton which would tide her over until spring Now the cotton was gone the food was gone the money was of no use to her for there was no food to buy with it and the neighbors were in worse plight than she At least she had the cow and the calf a few shoats and the horse and the neighbors had nothing but the little they had been able to hide in the woods and bury in the ground Fairhill the Tarleton home was burned to the foundations and Mrs Tarleton and the four girls were existing in the overseers house The Munroe house near Lovejoy was leveled too The wooden wing of Mimosa had burned and only the thick resistant stucco of the main house and the frenzied work of the Fontaine women and their slaves with wet blankets and quilts had saved it The Calverts house had again been spared due to the intercession of Hilton the Yankee overseer but there was not a head of livestock not a fowl not an ear of corn left on the place At Tara and throughout the County the problem was food Most of the families had nothing at all but the remains of their yam crops and their peanuts and such game as they could catch in the woods What they had each shared with less fortunate friends as they had done in more prosperous days But the time soon came when there was nothing to share At Tara they ate rabbit and possum and catfish if Pork was lucky On other days a small amount of milk hickory nuts roasted acorns and yams They were always hungry To Scarlett it seemed that at every turn she met outstretched hands pleading eyes The sight of them drove her almost to madness for she was as hungry as they She ordered the calf killed because he drank so much of the precious milk and that night everyone ate so much fresh veal all of them were ill She knew that she should kill one of the shoats but she put it off from day to day hoping to raise them to maturity They were so small There would be so little of them to eat if they were killed now and so much more if they could be saved a little longer Nightly she debated with Melanie the advisability of sending Pork abroad on the horse with some greenbacks to try to buy food But the fear that the horse might be captured and the money taken from Pork deterred them They did not know where the Yankees were They might be a thousand miles away or only across the river Once Scarlett in desperation started to ride out herself to search for food but the hysterical outbursts of the whole family fearful of the Yankees made her abandon the plan Pork foraged far at times not coming home all night and Scarlett did not ask him where he went Sometimes he returned with game sometimes with a few ears of corn a bag of dried peas Once he brought home a rooster which he said he found in the woods The family ate it with relish but a sense of guilt knowing very well Pork had stolen it as he had stolen the peas and corn One night soon after this he tapped on Scarletts door long after the house was asleep and sheepishly exhibited a leg peppered with small shot As she bandaged it for him he explained awkwardly that when attempting to get into a hen coop at Fayetteville he had been discovered Scarlett did not ask whose hen coop but patted Porks shoulder gently tears in her eyes Negroes were provoking sometimes and stupid and lazy but there was loyalty in them that money couldnt buy a feeling of oneness with their white folks which made them risk their lives to keep food on the table In other days Porks pilferings would have been a serious matter probably calling for a whipping In other days she would have been forced at least to reprimand him severely Always remember dear Ellen had said you are responsible for the moral as well as the physical welfare of the darkies God has entrusted to your care You must realize that they are like children and must be guarded from themselves like children and you must always set them a good example But now Scarlett pushed that admonition into the back of her mind That she was encouraging theft and perhaps theft from people worse off than she was no longer a matter for conscience In fact the morals of the affair weighed lightly upon her Instead of punishment or reproof she only regretted he had been shot You must be more careful Pork We dont want to lose you What would we do without you Youve been mighty good and faithful and when we get some money again Im going to buy you a big gold watch and engrave on it something out of the Bible  Page    Gone With The Wind Well done good and faithful servant  Pork beamed under the praise and gingerly rubbed his bandaged leg Dat soun mighty fine Miss Scarlett Wen you speckin ter git dat money I dont know Pork but Im going to get it some time somehow She bent on him an unseeing glance that was so passionately bitter he stirred uneasily Some day when this war is over Im going to have lots of money and when I do Ill never be hungry or cold again None of us will ever be hungry or cold Well all wear fine clothes and have fried chicken every day and Then she stopped The strictest rule at Tara one which she herself had made and which she rigidly enforced was that no one should ever talk of the fine meals they had eaten in the past or what they would eat now if they had the opportunity Pork slipped from the room as she remained staring moodily into the distance In the old days now dead and gone life had been so complex so full of intricate and complicated problems There had been the problem of trying to win Ashleys love and trying to keep a dozen other beaux dangling and unhappy There had been small breaches of conduct to be concealed from her elders jealous girls to be flouted or placated styles of dresses and materials to be chosen different coiffures to be tried and oh so many many other matters to be decided Now life was so amazingly simple Now all that mattered was food enough to keep off starvation clothing enough to prevent freezing and a roof overhead which did not leak too much It was during these days that Scarlett dreamed and dreamed again the nightmare which was to haunt her for years It was always the same dream the details never varied but the terror of it mounted each time it came to her and the fear of experiencing it again troubled even her waking hours She remembered so well the incidents of the day when she had first dreamed it Cold rain had fallen for days and the house was chill with drafts and dampness The logs in the fireplace were wet and smoky and gave little heat There had been nothing to eat except milk since breakfast for the yams were exhausted and Porks snares and fishlines had yielded nothing One of the shoats would have to be killed the next day if they were to eat at all Strained and hungry faces black and white were staring at her mutely asking her to provide food She would have to risk losing the horse and send Pork out to buy something And to make matters worse Wade was ill with a sore throat and a raging fever and there was neither doctor nor medicine for him Hungry weary with watching her child Scarlett left him to Melanies care for a while and lay down on her bed to nap Her feet icy she twisted and turned unable to sleep weighed down with fear and despair Again and again she thought What shall I do Where shall I turn Isnt there anybody in the world who can help me Where had all the security of the world gone Why wasnt there someone some strong wise person to take the burdens from her She wasnt made to carry them She did not know how to carry them And then she fell into an uneasy doze She was in a wild strange country so thick with swirling mist she could not see her hand before her face The earth beneath her feet was uneasy It was a haunted land still with a terrible stillness and she was lost in it lost and terrified as a child in the night She was bitterly cold and hungry and so fearful of what lurked in the mists about her that she tried to scream and could not There were things in the fog reaching out fingers to pluck at her skirt to drag her down into the uneasy quaking earth on which she stood silent relentless spectral hands Then she knew that somewhere in the opaque gloom about her there was shelter help a heaven of refuge and warmth But where was it Could she reach it before the hands clutched her and dragged her down into the quicksands Suddenly she was running running through the mist like a mad thing crying and screaming throwing out her arms to clutch only empty air and wet mist Where was the haven It eluded her but it was there hidden somewhere If she could only reach it If she could only reach it she would be safe But terror was weakening her legs hunger making her faint She gave one despairing cry and awoke to find Melanies worried face above her and Melanies hand shaking her to wakefulness The dream returned again and again whenever she went to sleep with an empty stomach And that was frequently enough It so frightened her that she feared to sleep although she feverishly told herself there was nothing in such a dream to be afraid of There was nothing in a dream about fog to scare her so Nothing at allyet the thought of dropping off into that mistfilled country so terrified her she began sleeping with Melanie who would wake her up when her moaning and twitching revealed that she was again in the clutch of the dream Under the strain she grew white and thin The pretty roundness left her face throwing her cheek bones into prominence emphasizing her slanting green eyes and giving her the look of a prowling hungry cat Daytime is enough like a nightmare without my dreaming things she thought desperately and began hoarding her daily ration to eat it just before she went to sleep At Christmas time Frank Kennedy and a small troop from the commissary department jogged up to Tara on a futile hunt for grain and animals for the army They were a ragged and ruffianly appearing crew mounted on lame and heaving horses which obviously were in too bad condition to be used for more active service Like their animals the men had been invalided out of the frontline forces and except for Frank all of them had an arm missing or an eye gone or stiffened joints Most of them wore blue overcoats of captured Yankees and for a brief instant of horror those at Tara thought Shermans men had returned They stayed the night on the plantation sleeping on the floor in the parlor luxuriating as they stretched themselves on the velvet rug for it had been weeks since they had slept under a roof or on anything softer than pine needles and hard earth For all their dirty beards and tatters they were a wellbred crowd full of pleasant small talk jokes and compliments and very glad to be spending Christmas Eve in a big house surrounded by pretty women as they had been accustomed to do in days long past They refused to be serious about the war told outrageous lies to make the girls laugh and brought to the bare and looted house the first lightness the first hint of festivity it had known in many a day Its almost like the old days when we had house parties isnt it whispered Suellen happily to Scarlett Suellen was raised to the skies by having a beau of her own in the house again and she could hardly take her eyes off Frank Kennedy Scarlett was surprised to see that Suellen could be almost pretty despite the thinness which had persisted since her illness Her cheeks were flushed and there was a soft luminous look in her eyes She really must care about him thought Scarlett in contempt And I guess shed be almost human if she ever had a husband  Page    Gone With The Wind of her own even if her husband was old fussbudget Frank Carreen had brightened a little too and some of the sleepwalking look left her eyes that night She had found that one of the men had known Brent Tarleton and had been with him the day he was killed and she promised herself a long private talk with him after supper At supper Melanie surprised them all by forcing herself out of her timidity and being almost vivacious She laughed and joked and almost but not quite coquetted with a oneeyed soldier who gladly repaid her efforts with extravagant gallantries Scarlett knew the effort this involved both mentally and physically for Melanie suffered torments of shyness in the presence of anything male Moreover she was far from well She insisted she was strong and did more work even than Dilcey but Scarlett knew she was sick When she lifted things her face went white and she had a way of sitting down suddenly after exertions as if her legs would no longer support her But tonight she like Suellen and Carreen was doing everything possible to make the soldiers enjoy their Christmas Eve Scarlett alone took no pleasure in the guests The troop had added their ration of parched corn and side meat to the supper of dried peas stewed dried apples and peanuts which Mammy set before them and they declared it was the best meal they had had in months Scarlett watched them eat and she was uneasy She not only begrudged them every mouthful they ate but she was on tenterhooks lest they discover somehow that Pork had slaughtered one of the shoats the day before It now hung in the pantry and she had grimly promised her household that she would scratch out the eyes of anyone who mentioned the shoat to their guests or the presence of the dead pigs sisters and brothers safe in their pen in the swamp These hungry men could devour the whole shoat at one meal and if they knew of the live hogs they could commandeer them for the army She was alarmed too for the cow and the horse and wished they were hidden in the swamp instead of tied in the woods at the bottom of the pasture If the commissary took her stock Tara could not possibly live through the winter There would be no way of replacing them As to what this army would eat she did not care Let the army feed the armyif it could It was hard enough for her to feed her own The men added as dessert some ramrod rolls from their knapsacks and this was the first time Scarlett had ever seen this Confederate article of diet about which there were almost as many jokes as about lice They were charred spirals of what appeared to be wood The men dared her to take a bite and when she did she discovered that beneath the smokeblackened surface was unsalted corn bread The soldiers mixed their ration of corn meal with water and salt too when they could get it wrapped the thick paste about their ramrods and roasted the mess over camp fires It was as hard as rock candy and as tasteless as sawdust and after one bite Scarlett hastily handed it back amid roars of laughter She met Melanies eyes and the same thought was plain in both faces  How can they go on fighting if they have only this stuff to eat The meal was gay enough and even Gerald presiding absently at the head of the table managed to evoke from the back of his dim mind some of the manner of a host and an uncertain smile The men talked the women smiled and flatteredbut Scarlett turning suddenly to Frank Kennedy to ask him news of Miss Pittypat caught an expression on his face which made her forget what she intended to say His eyes had left Suellens and were wandering about the room to Geralds childlike puzzled eyes to the floor bare of rugs to the mantelpiece denuded of its ornaments the sagging springs and torn upholstery into which Yankee bayonets had ripped the cracked mirror above the sideboard the unfaded squares on the wall where pictures had hung before the looters came the scant table service the decently mended but old dresses of the girls the flour sack which had been made into a kilt for Wade Frank was remembering the Tara he had known before the war and on his face was a hurt look a look of tired impotent anger He loved Suellen liked her sisters respected Gerald and had a genuine fondness for the plantation Since Sherman had swept through Georgia Frank had seen many appalling sights as he rode about the state trying to collect supplies but nothing had gone to his heart as Tara did now He wanted to do something for the OHaras especially Suellen and there was nothing he could do He was unconsciously wagging his whiskered head in pity and clicking his tongue against his teeth when Scarlett caught his eye He saw the flame of indignant pride in them and he dropped his gaze quickly to his plate in embarrassment The girls were hungry for news There had been no mail service since Atlanta fell now four months past and they were in complete ignorance as to where the Yankees were how the Confederate Army was faring what had happened to Atlanta and to old friends Frank whose work took him all over the section was as good as a newspaper better even for he was kin to or knew almost everyone from Macon north to Atlanta and he could supply bits of interesting personal gossip which the papers always omitted To cover his embarrassment at being caught by Scarlett he plunged hastily into a recital of news The Confederates he told them had retaken Atlanta after Sherman marched out but it was a valueless prize as Sherman had burned it completely But I thought Atlanta burned the night I left cried Scarlett bewildered I thought our boys burned it Oh no Miss Scarlett cried Frank shocked Wed never burn one of our own towns with our own folks in it What you saw burning was the warehouses and the supplies we didnt want the Yankees to capture and the foundries and the ammunition But that was all When Sherman took the town the houses and stores were standing there as pretty as you please And he quartered his men in them But what happened to the people Did hedid he kill them He killed somebut not with bullets said the oneeyed soldier grimly Soons he marched into Atlanta he told the mayor that all the people in town would have to move out every living soul And there were plenty of old folks that couldnt stand the trip and sick folks that ought not to have been moved and ladies who werewell ladies who hadnt ought to be moved either And he moved them out in the biggest rainstorm you ever saw hundreds and hundreds of them and dumped them in the woods near Rough and Ready and sent word to General Hood to come and get them And a plenty of the folks died of pneumonia and not being able to stand that sort of treatment Oh but why did he do that They couldnt have done him any harm cried Melanie He said he wanted the town to rest his men and horses in said Frank And he rested them there till the middle of November and then he lit out And he set fire to the whole town when he left and burned everything Oh surely not everything cried the girls in dismay It was inconceivable that the bustling town they knew so full of people so crowded with soldiers was gone All the lovely  Page    Gone With The Wind homes beneath shady trees all the big stores and the fine hotelssurely they couldnt be gone Melanie seemed ready to burst into tears for she had been born there and knew no other home Scarletts heart sank because she had come to love the place second only to Tara Well almost everything Frank amended hastily disturbed by the expressions on their faces He tried to look cheerful for he did not believe in upsetting ladies Upset ladies always upset him and made him feel helpless He could not bring himself to tell them the worst Let them find out from some one else He could not tell them what the army saw when it marched back into Atlanta the acres and acres of chimneys standing blackly above ashes piles of halfburned rubbish and tumbled heaps of brick clogging the streets old trees dying from fire their charred limbs tumbling to the ground in the cold wind He remembered how the sight had turned him sick remembered the bitter curses of the Confederates when they saw the remains of the town He hoped the ladies would never hear of the horrors of the looted cemetery for theyd never get over that Charlie Hamilton and Melanies mother and father were buried there The sight of that cemetery still gave Frank nightmares Hoping to find jewelry buried with the dead the Yankee soldiers had broken open vaults dug up graves They had robbed the bodies stripped from the coffins gold and silver name plates silver trimmings and silver handles The skeletons and corpses flung helterskelter among their splintered caskets lay exposed and so pitiful And Frank couldnt tell them about the dogs and the cats Ladies set such a store by pets But the thousands of starving animals left homeless when their masters had been so rudely evacuated had shocked him almost as much as the cemetery for Frank loved cats and dogs The animals had been frightened cold ravenous wild as forest creatures the strong attacking the weak the weak waiting for the weaker to die so they could eat them And above the ruined town the buzzards splotched the wintry sky with graceful sinister bodies Frank cast about in his mind for some mitigating information that would make the ladies feel better Theres some houses still standing he said houses that set on big lots away from other houses and didnt catch fire And the churches and the Masonic hall are left And a few stores too But the business section and all along the railroad tracks and at Five Pointswell ladies that part of town is flat on the ground Then cried Scarlettbitterly that warehouse Charlie left me down on the tracks its gone too If it was near the tracks its gone but Suddenly he smiled Why hadnt he thought of it before Cheer up ladies Your Aunt Pittys house is still standing Its kind of damaged but there it is Oh how did it escape Well its made of brick and its got about the only slate roof in Atlanta and that kept the sparks from setting it afire I guess And then its about the last house on the north end of town and the fire wasnt so bad over that way Of course the Yankees quartered there tore it up aplenty They even burned the baseboard and the mahogany stair rail for firewood but shucks Its in good shape When I saw Miss Pitty last week in Macon You saw her How is she Just fine Just fine When I told her her house was still standing she made up her mind to come home right away That isif that old darky Peter will let her come Lots of the Atlanta people have already come back because they got nervous about Macon Sherman didnt take Macon but everybody is afraid Wilsons raiders will get there soon and hes worse than Sherman But how silly of them to come back if there arent any houses Where do they live Miss Scarlett theyre living in tents and shacks and log cabins and doubling up six and seven families in the few houses still standing And theyre trying to rebuild Now Miss Scarlett dont say they are silly You know Atlanta folks as well as I do They are plumb set on that town most as bad as Charlestonians are about Charleston and itll take more than Yankees and a burning to keep them away Atlanta folks arebegging your pardon Miss Mellyas stubborn as mules about Atlanta I dont know why for I always thought that town a mighty pushy impudent sort of place But then Im a countryman born and I dont like any town And let me tell you the ones who are getting back first are the smart ones The ones who come back last wont find a stick or stone or brick of their houses because everybodys out salvaging things all over town to rebuild their houses Just day before yesterday I saw Mrs Merriwether and Miss Maybelle and their old darky woman out collecting brick in a wheelbarrow And Mrs Meade told me she was thinking about building a log cabin when the doctor comes back to help her She said she lived in a log cabin when she first came to Atlanta when it was Marthasville and it wouldnt bother her none to do it again Course she was only joking but that shows you how they feel about it I think theyve got a lot of spirit said Melanie proudly Dont you Scarlett Scarlett nodded a grim pleasure and pride in her adopted town filling her As Frank said it was a pushy impudent place and that was why she liked it It wasnt hidebound and stickinthemuddish like the older towns and it had a brash exuberance that matched her own Im like Atlanta she thought It takes more than Yankees or a burning to keep me down If Aunt Pitty is going back to Atlanta wed better go back and stay with her Scarlett said Melanie interrupting her train of thought Shell die of fright alone Now how can I leave here Melly Scarlett asked crossly If you are so anxious to go go I wont stop you Oh I didnt mean it that way darling cried Melanie flushing with distress How thoughtless of me Of course you cant leave Tara andand I guess Uncle Peter and Cookie can take care of Auntie Theres nothing to keep you from going Scarlett pointed out shortly You know I wouldnt leave you answered Melanie And II would be just frightened to death without you Suit yourself Besides you wouldnt catch me going back to Atlanta Just as soon as they get a few houses up Sherman will come back and burn it again He wont be back said Frank and despite his efforts his face drooped Hes gone on through the state to the coast Savannah was captured this week and they say the Yankees are going on up into South Carolina Savannah taken Yes Why ladies Savannah couldnt help but fall They didnt have enough men to hold it though they used every man they could getevery man who could drag one foot after another Do you know that when the Yankees were marching on  Page    Gone With The Wind Milledgeville they called out all the cadets from the military academies no matter how young they were and even opened the state penitentiary to get fresh troops Yes sir they turned loose every convict who was willing to fight and promised him a pardon if he lived through the war It kind of gave me the creeps to see those little cadets in the ranks with thieves and cutthroats They turned loose the convicts on us Now Miss Scarlett dont you get upset Theyre a long way off from here and furthermore theyre making good soldiers I guess being a thief dont keep a man from being a good soldier does it I think its wonderful said Melanie softly Well I dont said Scarlett flatly Theres thieves enough running around the country anyway what with the Yankees and She caught herself in time but the men laughed What with Yankees and our commissary department they finished and she flushed But wheres General Hoods army interposed Melanie hastily Surely he could have held Savannah Why Miss Melanie Frank was startled and reproachful General Hood hasnt been down in that section at all Hes been fighting up in Tennessee trying to draw the Yankees out of Georgia And didnt his little scheme work well cried Scarlett sarcastically He left the damn Yankees to go through us with nothing but schoolboys and convicts and Home Guards to protect us Daughter said Gerald rousing himself you are profane Your mother will be grieved They are damn Yankees cried Scarlett passionately And I never expect to call them anything else At the mention of Ellen everyone felt queer and conversation suddenly ceased Melanie again interposed When you were in Macon did you see India and Honey Wilkes Did theyhad they heard anything of Ashley Now Miss Melly you know if Id had news of Ashley Id have ridden up here from Macon right away to tell you said Frank reproachfully No they didnt have any news butnow dont you fret about Ashley Miss Melly I know its been a long time since you heard from him but you cant expect to hear from a fellow when hes in prison can you And things arent as bad in Yankee prisons as they are in ours After all the Yankees have plenty to eat and enough medicines and blankets They arent like we arenot having enough to feed ourselves much less our prisoners Oh the Yankees have got plenty cried Melanie passionately bitter But they dont give things to the prisoners You know they dont Mr Kennedy You are just saying that to make me feel better You know that our boys freeze to death up there and starve too and die without doctors and medicine simply because the Yankees hate us so much Oh if we could just wipe every Yankee off the face of the earth Oh I know that Ashley is Dont say it cried Scarlett her heart in her throat As long as no one said Ashley was dead there persisted in her heart a faint hope that he lived but she felt that if she heard the words pronounced in that moment he would die Now Mrs Wilkes dont you bother about your husband said the oneeyed man soothingly I was captured after first Manassas and exchanged later and when I was in prison they fed me off the fat of the land fried chicken and hot biscuits I think you are a liar said Melanie with a faint smile and the first sign of spirit Scarlett had ever seen her display with a man What do you think I think so too said the oneeyed man and slapped his leg with a laugh If youll all come into the parlor Ill sing you some Christmas carols said Melanie glad to change the subject The piano was one thing the Yankees couldnt carry away Is it terribly out of tune Suellen Dreadfully answered Suellen happily beckoning with a smile to Frank But as they all passed from the room Frank hung back tugging at Scarletts sleeve May I speak to you alone For an awful moment she feared he was going to ask about her livestock and she braced herself for a good lie When the room was cleared and they stood by the fire all the false cheerfulness which had colored Franks face in front of the others passed and she saw that he looked like an old man His face was as dried and brown as the leaves that were blowing about the lawn of Tara and his gingercolored whiskers were thin and scraggly and streaked with gray He clawed at them absently and cleared his throat in an annoying way before he spoke Im mighty sorry about your ma Miss Scarlett Please dont talk about it And your pa Has he been this way since Yesheshes not himself as you can see He sure set a store by her Oh Mr Kennedy please dont lets talk Im sorry Miss Scarlett and he shuffled his feet nervously The truth is I wanted to take up something with your pa and now I see it wont do any good Perhaps I can help you Mr Kennedy You seeIm the head of the house now Well I began Frank and again clawed nervously at his beard The truth is Well Miss Scarlett I was aiming to ask him for Miss Suellen Do you mean to tell me cried Scarlett in amused amazement that you havent yet asked Pa for Suellen And youve been courting her for years He flushed and grinned embarrassedly and in general looked like a shy and sheepish boy Well II didnt know if shed have me Im so much older than she is andthere were so many goodlooking young bucks hanging around Tara Hump thought Scarlett they were hanging around me not her And I dont know yet if shell have me Ive never asked her but she must know how I feel II thought Id ask Mr OHaras permission and tell him the truth Miss Scarlett I havent got a cent now I used to have a lot of money if youll forgive me mentioning it but right now all I own is my horse and the clothes Ive got on You see when I enlisted I sold most of my land and  Page    Gone With The Wind I put all my money in Confederate bonds and you know what theyre worth now Less than the paper theyre printed on And anyway I havent got them now because they burned up when the Yankees burned my sisters house I know Ive got gall asking for Miss Suellen now when I havent a cent butwell its this way I got to thinking that we dont know how things are going to turn out about this war It sure looks like the end of the world for me Theres nothing we can be sure of andand I thought it would be a heap of comfort to me and maybe to her if we were engaged That would be something sure I wouldnt ask to marry her till I could take care of her Miss Scarlett and I dont know when that will be But if true love carries any weight with you you can be certain Miss Suellen will be rich in that if nothing else He spoke the last words with a simple dignity that touched Scarlett even in her amusement It was beyond her comprehension that anyone could love Suellen Her sister seemed to her a monster of selfishness of complaints and of what she could only describe as pure cussedness Why Mr Kennedy she said kindly its quite all right Im sure I can speak for Pa He always set a store by you and he always expected Suellen to marry you Did he now cried Frank happiness in his face Indeed yes answered Scarlett concealing a grin as she remembered how frequently Gerald had rudely bellowed across the supper table to Suellen How now Missy Hasnt your ardent beau popped the question yet Shall I be asking him his intentions I shall ask her tonight he said his face quivering and he clutched her hand and shook it Youre so kind Miss Scarlett Ill send her to you smiled Scarlett starting for the parlor Melanie was beginning to play The piano was sadly out of tune but some of the chords were musical and Melanie was raising her voice to lead the others in Hark the Herald Angels Sing Scarlett paused It did not seem possible that war had swept over them twice that they were living in a ravaged country close to the border of starvation when this old sweet Christmas hymn was being sung Abruptly she turned to Frank What did you mean when you said it looked like the end of the world to you Ill talk frankly he said slowly but I wouldnt want you to be alarming the other ladies with what I say The war cant go on much longer There arent any fresh men to fill the ranks and the desertions are running highhigher than the army likes to admit You see the men cant stand to be away from their families when they know theyre starving so they go home to try to provide for them I cant blame them but it weakens the army And the army cant fight without food and there isnt any food I know because you see getting food is my business Ive been all up and down this section since we retook Atlanta and there isnt enough to feed a jaybird Its the same way for three hundred miles south to Savannah The folks are starving and the railroads are torn up and there arent any new rifles and the ammunition is giving out and theres no leather at all for shoes  So you see the end is almost here But the fading hopes of the Confederacy weighed less heavily on Scarlett than his remark about the scarcity of food It had been her intention to send Pork out with the horse and wagon the gold pieces and the United States money to scour the countryside for provisions and material for clothes But if what Frank said was true But Macon hadnt fallen There must be food in Macon Just as soon as the commissary department was safely on its way shed start Pork for Macon and take the chance of having the precious horse picked up by the army Shed have to risk it Well lets dont talk about unpleasant things tonight Mr Kennedy she said You go and sit in Mothers little office and Ill send Suellen to you so you canwell so youll have a little privacy Blushing smiling Frank slipped out of the room and Scarlett watched him go What a pity he cant marry her now she thought That would be one less mouth to feed CHAPTER XXIX THE FOLLOWING APRIL General Johnston who had been given back the shattered remnants of his old command surrendered them in North Carolina and the war was over But not until two weeks later did the news reach Tara There was too much to do at Tara for anyone to waste time traveling abroad and hearing gossip and as the neighbors were just as busy as they there was little visiting and news spread slowly Spring plowing was at its height and the cotton and garden seed Pork had brought from Macon was being put into the ground Pork had been almost worthless since the trip so proud was he of returning safely with his wagonload of dress goods seed fowls hams side meat and meal Over and over he told the story of his many narrow escapes of the bypaths and country lanes he had taken on his return to Tara the unfrequented roads the old trails the bridle paths He had been five weeks on the road agonizing weeks for Scarlett But she did not upbraid him on his return for she was happy that he had made the trip successfully and pleased that he brought back so much of the money she had given him She had a shrewd suspicion that the reason he had so much money left over was that he had not bought the fowls or most of the food Pork would have taken shame to himself had he spent her money when there were unguarded hen coops along the road and smokehouses handy Now that they had a little food everyone at Tara was busy trying to restore some semblance of naturalness to life There was work for every pair of hands too much work neverending work The withered stalks of last years cotton had to be removed to make way for this years seeds and the balky horse unaccustomed to the plow dragged unwillingly through the fields Weeds had to be pulled from the garden and the seeds planted firewood had to be cut a beginning had to be made toward replacing the pens and the miles and miles of fences so casually burned by the Yankees The snares Pork set for rabbits had to be visited twice a day and the fishlines in the river rebaited There were beds to be made and floors to be swept food to be cooked and dishes washed hogs and chickens to be fed and eggs gathered The cow had to be milked and pastured near the swamp and someone had to watch her all day for fear the Yankees or Frank Kennedys men would return and take her Even little Wade had his duties Every morning he went out importantly with a basket to pick up twigs and chips to start the fires with It was the Fontaine boys the first of the County men home from the war who brought the news of the surrender Alex who still had boots was walking and Tony barefooted was riding on the bare back of a mule Tony always managed to get the best of  Page    Gone With The Wind things in that family They were swarthier than ever from four years exposure to sun and storm thinner more wiry and the wild black beards they brought back from the war made them seem like strangers On their way to Mimosa and eager for home they only stopped a moment at Tara to kiss the girls and give them news of the surrender It was all over they said all finished and they did not seem to care much or want to talk about it All they wanted to know was whether Mimosa had been burned On the way south from Atlanta they had passed chimney after chimney where the homes of friends had stood and it seemed almost too much to hope that their own house had been spared They sighed with relief at the welcome news and laughed slapping their thighs when Scarlett told them of Sallys wild ride and how neatly she had cleared their hedge Shes a spunky girl said Tony and its rotten luck for her Joe getting killed You all got any chewing tobacco Scarlett Nothing but rabbit tobacco Pa smokes it in a corn cob I havent fallen that low yet said Tony but Ill probably come to it Is Dimity Munroe all right asked Alex eagerly but a little embarrassed and Scarlett recalled vaguely that he had been sweet on Sallys younger sister Oh yes Shes living with her aunt over in Fayetteville now You know their house in Lovejoy was burned And the rest of her folks are in Macon What he means ishas Dimity married some brave colonel in the Home Guard jeered Tony and Alex turned furious eyes upon him Of course she isnt married said Scarlett amused Maybe it would be better if she had said Alex gloomily How the hellI beg your pardon Scarlett But how can a man ask a girl to marry him when his darkies are all freed and his stock gone and he hasnt got a cent in his pockets You know that wouldnt bother Dimity said Scarlett She could afford to be loyal to Dimity and say nice things about her for Alex Fontaine had never been one of her own beaux Hells afire Well I beg your pardon again Ill have to quit swearing or Grandma will sure tan my hide Im not asking any girl to marry a pauper It mightnt bother her but it would bother me While Scarlett talked to the boys on the front porch Melanie Suellen and Carreen slipped silently into the house as soon as they heard the news of the surrender After the boys had gone cutting across the back fields of Tara toward home Scarlett went inside and heard the girls sobbing together on the sofa in Ellens little office It was all over the bright beautiful dream they had loved and hoped for the Cause which had taken their friends lovers husbands and beggared their families The Cause they had thought could never fall had fallen forever But for Scarlett there were no tears In the first moment when she heard the news she thought Thank God Now the cow wont be stolen Now the horse is safe Now we can take the silver out of the well and everybody can have a knife and fork Now I wont be afraid to drive round the country looking for something to eat What a relief Never again would she start in fear at the sound of hooves Never again would she wake in the dark nights holding her breath to listen wondering if it were reality or only a dream that she heard in the yard the rattle of bits the stamping of hooves and the harsh crying of orders by the Yankees And best of all Tara was safe Now her worst nightmare would never come true Now she would never have to stand on the lawn and see smoke billowing from the beloved house and hear the roar of flames as the roof fell in Yes the Cause was dead but war had always seemed foolish to her and peace was better She had never stood starry eyed when the Stars and Bars ran up a pole or felt cold chills when Dixie sounded She had not been sustained through privations the sickening duties of nursing the fears of the siege and the hunger of the last few months by the fanatic glow which made all these things endurable to others if only the Cause prospered It was all over and done with and she was not going to cry about it All over The war which had seemed so endless the war which unbidden and unwanted had cut her life in two had made so clean a cleavage that it was difficult to remember those other caretree days She could look back unmoved at the pretty Scarlett with her fragile green morocco slippers and her flounces fragrant with lavender but she wondered if she could be that same girl Scarlett OHara with the County at her feet a hundred slaves to do her bidding the wealth of Tara like a wall behind her and doting parents anxious to grant any desire of her heart Spoiled careless Scarlett who had never known an ungratified wish except where Ashley was concerned Somewhere on the long road that wound through those four years the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers had slipped away and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage except the indestructible red earth on which she stood As she stood in the hall listening to the girls sobbing her mind was busy Well plant more cotton lots more Ill send Pork to Macon tomorrow to buy more seed Now the Yankees wont burn it and our troops wont need it Good Lord Cotton ought to go sky high this fall She went into the little office and disregarding the weeping girls on the sofa seated herself at the secretary and picked up a quill to balance the cost of more cotton seed against her remaining cash The war is over she thought and suddenly she dropped the quill as a wild happiness flooded her The war was over and Ashleyif Ashley was alive hed be coming home She wondered if Melanie in the midst of mourning for the lost Cause had thought of this Soon well get a letterno not a letter We cant get letters But soonoh somehow hell let us know But the days passed into weeks and there was no news from Ashley The mail service in the South was uncertain and in the rural districts there was none at all Occasionally a passing traveler from Atlanta brought a note from Aunt Pitty tearfully begging the girls to come back But never news of Ashley After the surrender an everpresent feud over the horse smoldered between Scarlett and Suellen Now that there was no danger of Yankees Suellen wanted to go calling on the neighbors Lonely and missing the happy sociability of the old days Suellen  Page    Gone With The Wind longed to visit friends if for no other reason than to assure herself that the rest of the County was as bad off as Tara But Scarlett was adamant The horse was for work to drag logs from the woods to plow and for Pork to ride in search of food On Sundays he had earned the right to graze in the pasture and rest If Suellen wanted to go visiting she could go afoot Before the last year Suellen had never walked a hundred yards in her life and this prospect was anything but pleasing So she stayed at home and nagged and cried and said once too often Oh if only Mother was here At that Scarlett gave her the longpromised slap hitting her so hard it knocked her screaming to the bed and caused great consternation throughout the house Thereafter Suellen whined the less at least in Scarletts presence Scarlett spoke truthfully when she said she wanted the horse to rest but that was only half of the truth The other half was that she had paid one round of calls on the County in the first month after the surrender and the sight of old friends and old plantations had shaken her courage more than she liked to admit The Fontaines had fared best of any thanks to Sallys hard ride but it was flourishing only by comparison with the desperate situation of the other neighbors Grandma Fontaine had never completely recovered from the heart attack she had the day she led the others in beating out the flames and saving the house Old Dr Fontaine was convalescing slowly from an amputated arm Alex and Tony were turning awkward hands to plows and hoe handles They leaned over the fence rail to shake hands with Scarlett when she called and they laughed at her rickety wagon their black eyes bitter for they were laughing at themselves as well as her She asked to buy seed corn from them and they promised it and fell to discussing farm problems They had twelve chickens two cows five hogs and the mule they brought home from the war One of the hogs had just died and they were worried about losing the others At bearing such serious words about hogs from these exdandies who had never given life a more serious thought than which cravat was most fashionable Scarlett laughed and this time her laugh was bitter too They had all made her welcome at Mimosa and had insisted on giving not selling her the seed corn The quick Fontaine tempers flared when she put a greenback on the table and they flatly refused payment Scarlett took the corn and privately slipped a dollar bill into Sallys hand Sally looked like a different person from the girl who had greeted her eight months before when Scarlett first came home to Tara Then she had been pale and sad but there had been a buoyancy about her Now that buoyancy had gone as if the surrender had taken all hope from her Scarlett she whispered as she clutched the bill what was the good of it all Why did we ever fight Oh my poor Joe Oh my poor baby I dont know why we fought and I dont care said Scarlett And Im not interested I never was interested War is a mans business not a womans All Im interested in now is a good cotton crop Now take this dollar and buy little Joe a dress God knows he needs it Im not going to rob you of your corn for all Alex and Tonys politeness The boys followed her to the wagon and assisted her in courtly for all their rags gay with the volatile Fontaine gaiety but with the picture of their destitution in her eyes she shivered as she drove away from Mimosa She was so tired of poverty and pinching What a pleasure it would be to know people who were rich and not worried as to where the next meal was coming from Cade Calvert was at home at Pine Bloom and as Scarlett came up the steps of the old house in which she had danced so often in happier days she saw that death was in his face He was emaciated and he coughed as he lay in an easy chair in the sunshine with a shawl across his knees but his face lit up when he saw her Just a little cold which had settled in his chest he said trying to rise to greet her Got it from sleeping so much in the rain But it would be gone soon and then hed lend a hand in the work Cathleen Calvert who came out of the house at the sound of voices met Scarletts eyes above her brothers head and in them Scarlett read knowledge and bitter despair Cade might not know but Cathleen knew Pine Bloom looked straggly and overgrown with weeds seedling pines were beginning to show in the fields and the house was sagging and untidy Cathleen was thin and taut The two of them with their Yankee stepmother their four little halfsisters and Hilton the Yankee overseer remained in the silent oddly echoing house Scarlett had never liked Hilton any more than she liked their own overseer Jonas Wilkerson and she liked him even less now as he sauntered forward and greeted her like an equal Formerly he had the same combination of servility and impertinence which Wilkerson possessed but now with Mr Calvert and Raiford dead in the war and Cade sick he had dropped all servility The second Mrs Calvert had never known how to compel respect from negro servants and it was not to be expected that she could get it from a white man Mr Hilton has been so kind about staying with us through these difficult times said Mrs Calvert nervously casting quick glances at her silent stepdaughter Very kind I suppose you heard how he saved our house twice when Sherman was here Im sure I dont know how we would have managed without him with no money and Cade A flush went over Cades white face and Cathleens long lashes veiled her eyes as her mouth hardened Scarlett knew their souls were writhing in helpless rage at being under obligations to their Yankee overseer Mrs Calvert seemed ready to weep She had somehow made a blunder She was always blundering She just couldnt understand Southerners for all that she had lived in Georgia twenty years She never knew what not to say to her stepchildren and no matter what she said or did they were always so exquisitely polite to her Silently she vowed she would go North to her own people taking her children with her and leave these puzzling stiffnecked strangers After these visits Scarlett had no desire to see the Tarletons Now that the four boys were gone the house burned and the family cramped in the overseers cottage she could not bring herself to go But Suellen and Carreen begged and Melanie said it would be unneighborly not to call and welcome Mr Tarleton back from the war so one Sunday they went This was the worst of all As they drove up by the ruins of the house they saw Beatrice Tarleton dressed in a worn riding habit a crop under her arm sitting on the top rail of the fence about the paddock staring moodily at nothing Beside her perched the bowlegged little negro who had trained her horses and he looked as glum as his mistress The paddock once full of frolicking colts and placid brood mares was empty now except for one mule the mule Mr Tarleton had ridden home from the surrender I swear I dont know what to do with myself now that my darlings are gone said Mrs Tarleton climbing down from the fence A stranger might have thought she spoke of her four dead sons but the girls from Tara knew her horses were in her mind  Page    Gone With The Wind All my beautiful horses dead And oh my poor Nellie If I just had Nellie And nothing but a damned mule on the place A damned mule she repeated looking indignantly at the scrawny beast Its an insult to the memory of my blooded darlings to have a mule in their paddock Mules are misbegotten unnatural critters and it ought to be illegal to breed them Jim Tarleton completely disguised by a bushy beard came out of the overseers house to welcome and kiss the girls and his four redhaired daughters in mended dresses streamed out behind him tripping over the dozen black and tan hounds which ran barking to the door at the sound of strange voices There was an air of studied and determined cheerfulness about the whole family which brought a colder chill to Scarletts bones than the bitterness of Mimosa or the deathly brooding of Pine Bloom The Tarletons insisted that the girls stay for dinner saying they had so few guests these days and wanted to hear all the news Scarlett did not want to linger for the atmosphere oppressed her but Melanie and her two sisters were anxious for a longer visit so the four stayed for dinner and ate sparingly of the side meat and dried peas which were served them There was laughter about the skimpy fare and the Tarleton girls giggled as they told of makeshifts for clothes as if they were telling the most amusing of jokes Melanie met them halfway surprising Scarlett with her unexpected vivacity as she told of trials at Tara making light of hardships Scarlett could hardly speak at all The room seemed so empty without the four great Tarleton boys lounging and smoking and teasing And if it seemed empty to her what must it seem to the Tarletons who were offering a smiling front to their neighbors Carreen had said little during the meal but when it was over she slipped over to Mrs Tarletons side and whispered something Mrs Tarletons face changed and the brittle smile left her lips as she put her arm around Carreens slender waist They left the room and Scarlett who felt she could not endure the house another minute followed them They went down the path through the garden and Scarlett saw they were going toward the burying ground Well she couldnt go back to the house now It would seem too rude But what on earth did Carreen mean dragging Mrs Tarleton out to the boys graves when Beatrice was trying so hard to be brave There were two new marble markers in the brickenclosed lot under the funereal cedarsso new that no rain had splashed them with red dust We got them last week said Mrs Tarleton proudly Mr Tarleton went to Macon and brought them home in the wagon Tombstones And what they must have cost Suddenly Scarlett did not feel as sorry for the Tarletons as she had at first Anybody who would waste precious money on tombstones when food was so dear so almost unattainable didnt deserve sympathy And there were several lines carved on each of the stones The more carving the more money The whole family must be crazy And it had cost money too to bring the three boys bodies home They had never found Boyd or any trace of him Between the graves of Brent and Stuart was a stone which read They were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided On the other stone were the names of Boyd and Tom with something in Latin which began Dulce et but it meant nothing to Scarlett who had managed to evade Latin at the Fayetteville Academy All that money for tombstones Why they were fools She felt as indignant as if her own money had been squandered Carreens eyes were shining oddly I think its lovely she whispered pointing to the first stone Carreen would think it lovely Anything sentimental stirred her Yes said Mrs Tarleton and her voice was soft we thought it very fittingthey died almost at the same time Stuart first and then Brent who caught up the flag he dropped As the girls drove back to Tara Scarlett was silent for a while thinking of what she had seen in the various homes remembering against her will the County in its glory with visitors at all the big houses and money plentiful negroes crowding the quarters and the welltended fields glorious with cotton In another year therell be little pines all over these fields she thought and looking toward the encircling forest she shuddered Without the darkies it will be all we can do to keep body and soul together Nobody can run a big plantation without the darkies and lots of the fields wont be cultivated at all and the woods will take over the fields again Nobody can plant much cotton and what will we do then Whatll become of country folks Town folks can manage somehow Theyve always managed But we country folks will go back a hundred years like the pioneers who had little cabins and just scratched a few acresand barely existed No she thought grimly Tara isnt going to be like that Not even if I have to plow myself This whole section this whole state can go back to woods if it wants to but I wont let Tara go And I dont intend to waste my money on tombstones or my time crying about the war We can make out somehow I know we could make out somehow if the men werent all dead Losing the darkies isnt the worst part about this Its the loss of the men the young men She thought again of the four Tarletons and Joe Fontaine of Raiford Calvert and the Munroe brothers and all the boys from Fayetteville and Jonesboro whose names she had read on the casualty lists If there were just enough men left we could manage somehow but Another thought struck hersuppose she wanted to marry again Of course she didnt want to marry again Once was certainly enough Besides the only man shed ever wanted was Ashley and he was married if he was still living But suppose she would want to marry Who would there be to marry her The thought was appalling Melly she said whats going to happen to Southern girls What do you mean Just what I say Whats going to happen to them Theres no one to marry them Why Melly with all the boys dead therell be thousands of girls all over the South wholl die old maids And never have any children added Melanie to whom this was the most important thing Evidently the thought was not new to Suellen who sat in the back of the wagon for she suddenly began to cry She had not heard from Frank Kennedy since Christmas She did not know if the lack of mail service was the cause or if he had merely trifled with her affections and then forgotten her Or maybe he had been killed in the last days of the war The latter would have been infinitely preferable to his forgetting her for at least there was some dignity about a dead love such as Carreen and India Wilkes  Page    Gone With The Wind had but none about a deserted fiance Oh in the name of God hush said Scarlett Oh you can talk sobbed Suellen because youve been married and had a baby and everybody knows some man wanted you But look at me And youve got to be mean and throw it up to me that Im an old maid when I cant help myself I think youre hateful Oh hush You know how I hate people who bawl all the time You know perfectly well old Ginger Whiskers isnt dead and that hell come back and marry you He hasnt any better sense But personally Id rather be an old maid than marry him There was silence from the back of the wagon for a while and Carreen comforted her sister with absentminded pats for her mind was a long way off riding paths three years old with Brent Tarleton beside her There was a glow an exaltation in her eyes Ah said Melanie sadly what will the South be like without all our fine boys What would the South have been if they had lived We could use their courage and their energy and their brains Scarlett all of us with little boys must raise them to take the places of the men who are gone to be brave men like them There will never again be men like them said Carreen softly No one can take their places They drove home the rest of the way in silence One day not long after this Cathleen Calvert rode up to Tara at sunset Her sidesaddle was strapped on as sorry a mule as Scarlett had ever seen a flopeared lame brute and Cathleen was almost as sorry looking as the animal she rode Her dress was of faded gingham of the type once worn only by house servants and her sunbonnet was secured under her chin by a piece of twine She rode up to the front porch but did not dismount and Scarlett and Melanie who had been watching the sunset went down the steps to meet her Cathleen was as white as Cade had been the day Scarlett called white and hard and brittle as if her face would shatter if she spoke But her back was erect and her head was high as she nodded to them Scarlett suddenly remembered the day of the Wilkes barbecue when she and Cathleen had whispered together about Rhett Butler How pretty and fresh Cathleen had been that day in a swirl of blue organdie with fragrant roses at her sash and little black velvet slippers laced about her small ankles And now there was not a trace of that girl in the stiff figure sitting on the mule I wont get down thank you she said I just came to tell you that Im going to be married What Who to Cathy how grand When Tomorrow said Cathleen quietly and there was something in her voice which took the eager smiles from their faces I came to tell you that Im going to be married tomorrow in Jonesboroand Im not inviting you all to come They digested this in silence looking up at her puzzled Then Melanie spoke Is it someone we know dear Yes said Cathleen shortly Its Mr Hilton Mr Hilton Yes Mr Hilton our overseer Scarlett could not even find voice to say Oh but Cathleen peering down suddenly at Melanie said in a low savage voice If you cry Melly I cant stand it I shall die Melanie said nothing but patted the foot in its awkward homemade shoe which hung from the stirrup Her bead was low And dont pat me I cant stand that either Melanie dropped her hand but still did not look up Well I must go I only came to tell you The white brittle mask was back again and she picked up the reins How is Cade asked Scarlett utterly at a loss but fumbling for some words to break the awkward silence He is dying said Cathleen shortly There seemed to be no feeling in her voice And he is going to die in some comfort and peace if I can manage it without worry about who will take care of me when hes gone You see my stepmother and the children are going North for good tomorrow Well I must be going Melanie looked up and met Cathleens hard eyes There were bright tears on Melanies lashes and understanding in her eyes and before them Cathleens lips curved into the crooked smile of a brave child who tries not to cry It was all very bewildering to Scarlett who was still trying to grasp the idea that Cathleen Calvert was going to marry an overseerCathleen daughter of a rich planter Cathleen who next to Scarlett had had more beaux than any girl in the County Cathleen bent down and Melanie tiptoed They kissed Then Cathleen flapped the bridle reins sharply and the old mule moved off Melanie looked after her the tears streaming down her face Scarlett stared still dazed Melly is she crazy You know she cant be in love with him In love Oh Scarlett dont even suggest such a horrid thing Oh poor Cathleen Poor Cade Fiddledeedee cried Scarlett beginning to be irritated It was annoying that Melanie always seemed to grasp more of situations than she herself did Cathleens plight seemed to her more startling than catastrophic Of course it was no pleasant thought marrying Yankee white trash but after all a girl couldnt live alone on a plantation she had to have a husband to help her run it Melly its like I said the other day There isnt anybody for girls to marry and theyve got to marry someone Oh they dont have to marry Theres nothing shameful in being a spinster Look at Aunt Pitty Oh Id rather see Cathleen dead I know Cade would rather see her dead Its the end of the Calverts Just think what herwhat their children will be Oh Scarlett have Pork saddle the horse quickly and you ride after her and tell her to come live with us Good Lord cried Scarlett shocked at the matteroffact way in which Melanie was offering Tara Scarlett certainly had no intention of feeding another mouth She started to say this but something in Melanies stricken face halted the words  Page    Gone With The Wind She wouldnt come Melly she amended You know she wouldnt Shes so proud and shed think it was charity Thats true thats true said Melanie distractedly watching the small cloud of red dust disappear down the road Youve been with me for months thought Scarlett grimly looking at her sisterinlaw and its never occurred to you that its charity youre living on And I guess it never will Youre one of those people the war didnt change and you go right on thinking and acting just like nothing had happenedlike we were still rich as Croesus and had more food than we know what to do with and guests didnt matter I guess Ive got you on my neck for the rest of my life But I wont have Cathleen too CHAPTER XXX IN THAT warm summer after peace came Tara suddenly lost its isolation And for months thereafter a stream of scarecrows bearded ragged footsore and always hungry toiled up the red hill to Tara and came to rest on the shady front steps wanting food and a nights lodging They were Confederate soldiers walking home The railroad had carried the remains of Johnstons army from North Carolina to Atlanta and dumped them there and from Atlanta they began their pilgrimages afoot When the wave of Johnstons men had passed the weary veterans from the Army of Virginia arrived and then men from the Western troops beating their way south toward homes which might not exist and families which might be scattered or dead Most of them were walking a few fortunate ones rode bony horses and mules which the terms of the surrender had permitted them to keep gaunt animals which even an untrained eye could tell would never reach faraway Florida and south Georgia Going home Going home That was the only thought in the soldiers minds Some were sad and silent others gay and contemptuous of hardships but the thought that it was all over and they were going home was the one thing that sustained them Few of them were bitter They left bitterness to their women and their old people They had fought a good fight had been licked and were willing to settle down peaceably to plowing beneath the flag they had fought Going home Going home They could talk of nothing else neither battles nor wounds nor imprisonment nor the future Later they would refight battles and tell children and grandchildren of pranks and forays and charges of hunger forced marches and wounds but not now Some of them lacked an arm or a leg or an eye many had scars which would ache in rainy weather if they lived for seventy years but these seemed small matters now Later it would be different Old and young talkative and taciturn rich planter and sallow Cracker they all had two things in common lice and dysentery The Confederate soldier was so accustomed to his verminous state he did not give it a thought and scratched unconcernedly even in the presence of ladies As for dysenterythe bloody flux as the ladies delicately called itit seemed to have spared no one from private to general Four years of halfstarvation four years of rations which were coarse or green or halfputrefied had done its work with them and every soldier who stopped at Tara was either just recovering or was actively suffering from it Dey ain a soun set of bowels in de whole Confedrut ahmy observed Mammy darkly as she sweated over the fire brewing a bitter concoction of blackberry roots which had been Ellens sovereign remedy for such afflictions Its mah notion dat twarnt de Yankees whut beat our gempmum Twuz dey own innards Kain no gempmum fight wid his bowels tuhnin ter water One and all Mammy dosed them never waiting to ask foolish questions about the state of their organs and one and all they drank her doses meekly and with wry faces remembering perhaps other stern black faces in faroff places and other inexorable black hands holding medicine spoons In the matter of compny Mammy was equally adamant No liceridden soldier should come into Tara She marched them behind a clump of thick bushes relieved them of their uniforms gave them a basin of water and strong lye soap to wash with and provided them with quilts and blankets to cover their nakedness while she boiled their clothing in her huge wash pot It was useless for the girls to argue hotly that such conduct humiliated the soldiers Mammy replied that the girls would be a sight more humiliated if they found lice upon themselves When the soldiers began arriving almost daily Mammy protested against their being allowed to use the bedrooms Always she feared lest some louse had escaped her Rather than argue the matter Scarlett turned the parlor with its deep velvet rug into a dormitory Mammy cried out equally loudly at the sacrilege of soldiers being permitted to sleep on Miss Ellens rug but Scarlett was firm They had to sleep somewhere And in the months after the surrender the deep soft nap began to show signs of wear and finally the heavy warp and woof showed through in spots where heels had worn it and spurs dug carelessly Of each soldier they asked eagerly of Ashley Suellen bridling always asked news of Mr Kennedy But none of the soldiers had ever heard of them nor were they inclined to talk about the missing It was enough that they themselves were alive and they did not care to think of the thousands in unmarked graves who would never come home The family tried to bolster Melanies courage after each of these disappointments Of course Ashley hadnt died in prison Some Yankee chaplain would have written if this were true Of course he was coming home but his prison was so far away Why goodness it took days riding on a train to make the trip and if Ashley was walking like these men  Why hadnt he written Well darling you know what the mails are nowso uncertain and slipshod even where mail routes are reestablished But supposesuppose he had died on the way home Now Melanie some Yankee woman would have surely written us about it  Yankee women Bah  Melly there are some nice Yankee women Oh yes there are God couldnt make a whole nation without having some nice women in it Scarlett you remember we did meet a nice Yankee woman at Saratoga that timeScarlett tell Melly about her Nice my foot replied Scarlett She asked me how many bloodhounds we kept to chase our darkies with I agree with Melly I never saw a nice Yankee male or female But dont cry Melly Ashleyll come home Its a long walk and maybemaybe he hasnt got any boots Then at the thought of Ashley barefooted Scarlett could have cried Let other soldiers limp by in rags with their feet tied up in sacks and strips of carpet but not Ashley He should come home on a prancing horse dressed in fine clothes and shining boots a plume in his hat It was the final degradation for her to think of Ashley reduced to the state of these other soldiers One afternoon in June when everyone at Tara was assembled on the back porch eagerly watching Pork cut the first halfripe  Page    Gone With The Wind watermelon of the season they heard hooves on the gravel of the front drive Prissy started languidly toward the front door while those left behind argued hotly as to whether they should hide the melon or keep it for supper should the caller at the door prove to be a soldier Melly and Carreen whispered that the soldier guest should have a share and Scarlett backed by Suellen and Mammy hissed to Pork to hide it quickly Dont be a goose girls Theres not enough for us as it is and if there are two or three famished soldiers out there none of us will even get a taste said Scarlett While Pork stood with the little melon clutched to him uncertain as to the final decision they heard Prissy cry out Gawdlmighty Miss Scarlett Miss Melly Come quick Who is it cried Scarlett leaping up from the steps and racing through the hall with Melly at her shoulder and the others streaming after her Ashley she thought Oh perhaps Its Uncle Peter Miss Pittypats Uncle Peter They all ran out to the front porch and saw the tall grizzled old despot of Aunt Pittys house climbing down from a rattailed nag on which a section of quilting had been strapped On his wide black face accustomed dignity strove with delight at seeing old friends with the result that his brow was furrowed in a frown but his mouth was hanging open like a happy toothless old hounds Everyone ran down the steps to greet him black and white shaking his hand and asking questions but Mellys voice rose above them all Auntie isnt sick is she Nom Shes poly thank God answered Peter fastening a severe look first on Melly and then on Scarlett so that they suddenly felt guilty but could think of no reason why Shes poly but she is plum outdone wid you young Misses an ef it come right down to it Ah is too Why Uncle Peter What on earth Yall neen try ter scuse youseffs Ain Miss Pitty writ you an writ you ter come home

You young Misses ought ter tek shame leavin po Miss Pitty lone wid half her frens daid an de other half in Macom an Lanta full of Yankee sojers an trashy free issue niggers The two girls had borne the castigation with straight faces as long as they could but the thought of Aunt Pitty sending Peter to scold them and bring them back bodily to Atlanta was too much for their control They burst into laughter and hung on each others shoulders for support Naturally Pork and Dilcey and Mammy gave vent to loud guffaws at hearing the detractor of their beloved Tara set at naught Suellen and Carreen giggled and even Geralds face wore a vague smile Everyone laughed except Peter who shifted from one large splayed foot to the other in mounting indignation Whuts wrong wid you nigger inquired Mammy

Did Auntie send you all the way down here just to bring us back on that bag of bones At this question Peters jaw suddenly dropped and guilt and consternation swept over his wrinkled black face His

sagging body from falling to the ground You pious black ape Brek it genly You Poke tek her feet Miss Carreen steady her haid Lessus lay her on de sofa in de parlor There was a tumult of sound as everyone but Scarlett swarmed about the fainting Melanie everyone crying out in alarm scurrying into the house for water and pillows and in a moment Scarlett and Uncle Peter were left standing alone on the walk She stood rooted unable to move from the position to which she had leaped when she heard his words staring at the old man who stood feebly waving a letter His old black face was as pitiful as a childs under its mothers disapproval his dignity collapsed For a moment she could not speak or move and though her mind shouted He isnt dead Hes coming home the knowledge brought neither joy nor excitement only a stunned immobility Uncle Peters voice came as from a far distance plaintive placating Mist Willie Burr frum Macom whut is kin ter us he brung it ter Miss Pitty Mist Willie he in de same jail house wid Mist Ashley Mist Willie he got a hawse an he got hyah soon But Mist Ashley he awalkin an Scarlett snatched the letter from his hand It was addressed to Melly in Miss Pittys writing but that did not make her hesitate a moment She ripped it open and Miss Pittys enclosed note fell to the ground Within the envelope there was a piece of folded paper grimy from the dirty pocket in which it had been carried creased and ragged about the edges It bore the inscription in Ashleys hand Mrs George Ashley Wilkes Care Miss Sarah Jane Hamilton Atlanta or Twelve Oaks Jonesboro Ga With fingers that shook she opened it and read Beloved I am coming home to you Tears began to stream down her face so that she could not read and her heart swelled up until she felt she could not bear the joy of it Clutching the letter to her she raced up the porch steps and down the hall past the parlor where an the inhabitants of Tara were getting in one anothers way as they worked over the unconscious Melanie and into Ellens office She shut the door and locked it and flung herself down on the sagging old sofa crying laughing kissing the letter Beloved she whispered I am coming home to you Common sense told them that unless Ashley developed wings it would be weeks or even months before he could travel from Illinois to Georgia but hearts nevertheless beat wildly whenever a soldier turned into the avenue at Tara Each bearded scarecrow might be Ashley And if it were not Ashley perhaps the soldier would have news of him or a letter from Aunt Pitty about him Black and white they rushed to the front porch every time they heard footsteps The sight of a uniform was enough to bring everyone flying from the woodpile the pasture and the cotton patch For a month after the letter came work was almost at a standstill No one wanted to be out of the house when he arrived Scarlett least of all And she could not insist on the others attending to their duties when she so neglected hers But when the weeks crawled by and Ashley did not come or any news of him Tara settled back into its old routine Longing hearts could only stand so much of longing An uneasy fear crept into Scarletts mind that something had happened to him along the way Rock Island was so far away and he might have been weak or sick when released from prison And he had no money and was tramping through a country where Confederates were hated If only she knew where he was she would send money to him send every penny she had and let the family go hungry so he could come home swiftly on the train Beloved I am coming home to you In the first rush of joy when her eyes met those words they had meant only that Ashley was coming home to her Now in the light of cooler reason it was Melanie to whom he was returning Melanie who went about the house these days singing with joy Occasionally Scarlett wondered bitterly why Melanie could not have died in childbirth in Atlanta That would have made things perfect Then she could have married Ashley after a decent interval and made little Beau a good stepmother too When such thoughts came she did not pray hastily to God telling Him she did not mean it God did not frighten her any more Soldiers came singly and in pairs and dozens and they were always hungry Scarlett thought despairingly that a plague of locusts would be more welcome She cursed again the old custom of hospitality which had flowered in the era of plenty the custom which would not permit any traveler great or humble to go on his journey without a nights lodging food for himself and his horse and the utmost courtesy the house could give She knew that era had passed forever but the rest of the household did not nor did the soldiers and each soldier was welcomed as if he were a longawaited guest As the neverending line went by her heart hardened They were eating the food meant for the mouths of Tara vegetables over whose long rows she had wearied her back food she had driven endless miles to buy Food was so hard to get and the money in the Yankees wallet would not last forever Only a few greenbacks and the two gold pieces were left now Why should she feed this horde of hungry men The war was over They would never again stand between her and danger So she gave orders to Pork that when soldiers were in the house the table should be set sparely This order prevailed until she noticed that Melanie who had never been strong since Beau was born was inducing Pork to put only dabs of food on her plate and giving her share to the soldiers Youll have to stop it Melanie she scolded Youre half sick yourself and if you dont eat more youll be sick in bed and well have to nurse you Let these men go hungry They can stand it Theyve stood it for four years and it wont hurt them to stand it a little while longer Melanie turned to her and on her face was the first expression of naked emotion Scarlett had ever seen in those serene eyes Oh Scarlett dont scold me Let me do it You dont know how it helps me Every time I give some poor man my share I think that maybe somewhere on the road up north some woman is giving my Ashley a share of her dinner and its helping him to get home to me My Ashley Beloved I am coming home to you  Page    Gone With The Wind Scarlett turned away wordless After that Melanie noticed there was more food on the table when guests were present even though Scarlett might grudge them every mouthful When the soldiers were too ill to go on and there were many such Scarlett put them to bed with none too good grace Each sick man meant another mouth to feed Someone had to nurse him and that meant one less worker at the business of fence building hoeing weeding and plowing One boy on whose face a blond fuzz had just begun to sprout was dumped on the front porch by a mounted soldier bound for Fayetteville He had found him unconscious by the roadside and had brought him across his saddle to Tara the nearest house The girls thought he must be one of the little cadets who had been called out of military school when Sherman approached Milledgeville but they never knew for he died without regaining consciousness and a search of his pockets yielded no information A nicelooking boy obviously a gentleman and somewhere to the south some woman was watching the roads wondering where he was and when he was coming home just as she and Melanie with a wild hope in their hearts watched every bearded figure that came up their walk They buried the cadet in the family burying ground next to the three little OHara boys and Melanie cried sharply as Pork filled in the grave wondering in her heart if strangers were doing this same thing to the tall body of Ashley Will Benteen was another soldier like the nameless boy who arrived unconscious across the saddle of a comrade Will was acutely ill with pneumonia and when the girls put him to bed they feared he would soon join the boy in the burying ground He had the sallow malarial face of the south Georgia Cracker pale pinkish hair and washedout blue eyes which even in delirium were patient and mild One of his legs was gone at the knee and to the stump was fitted a roughly whittled wooden peg He was obviously a Cracker just as the boy they had buried so short a while ago was obviously a planters son Just how the girls knew this they could not say Certainly Will was no dirtier no more hairy no more lice infested than many fine gentlemen who came to Tara Certainly the language he used in his delirium was no less grammatical than that of the Tarleton twins But they knew instinctively as they knew thoroughbred horses from scrubs that he was not of their class But this knowledge did not keep them from laboring to save him Emaciated from a year in a Yankee prison exhausted by his long tramp on his illfitting wooden peg he had little strength to combat pneumonia and for days he lay in the bed moaning trying to get up fighting battles over again Never once did he call for mother wife sister or sweetheart and this omission worried Carreen A man ought to have some folks she said And he sounds like he didnt have a soul in the world For all his lankiness he was tough and good nursing pulled him through The day came when his pale blue eyes perfectly cognizant of his surroundings fell upon Carreen sitting beside him telling her rosary beads the morning sun shining through her fair hair Then you warnt a dream after all he said in his flat toneless voice I hope I aint troubled you too much Mam His convalescence was a long one and he lay quietly looking out of the window at the magnolias and causing very little trouble to anyone Carreen liked him because of his placid and unembarrassed silences She would sit beside him through the long hot afternoons fanning him and saying nothing Carreen had very little to say these days as she moved delicate and wraithlike about the tasks which were within her strength She prayed a good deal for when Scarlett came into her room without knocking she always found her on her knees by her bed The sight never failed to annoy her for Scarlett felt that the time for prayer had passed If God had seen fit to punish them so then God could very well do without prayers Religion had always been a bargaining process with Scarlett She promised God good behavior in exchange for favors God had broken the bargain time and again to her way of thinking and she felt that she owed Him nothing at all now And whenever she found Carreen on her knees when she should have been taking an afternoon nap or doing the mending she felt that Carreen was shirking her share of the burdens She said as much to Will Benteen one afternoon when he was able to sit up in a chair and was startled when he said in his flat voice Let her be Miss Scarlett It comforts her Comforts her Yes shes prayin for your ma and him Who is him His faded blue eyes looked at her from under sandy lashes without surprise Nothing seemed to surprise or excite him Perhaps he had seen too much of the unexpected ever to be startled again That Scarlett did not know what was in her sisters heart did not seem odd to him He took it as naturally as he did the fact that Carreen had found comfort in talking to him a stranger Her beau that boy Brent somethingorother who was killed at Gettysburg Her beau said Scarlett shortly Her beau nothing He and his brother were my beaux Yes so she told me Looks like most of the County was your beaux But all the same he was her beau after you turned him down because when he come home on his last furlough they got engaged She said he was the only boy shed ever cared about and so it kind of comforts her to pray for him Well fiddledeedee said Scarlett a very small dart of jealousy entering her She looked curiously at this lanky man with his bony stooped shoulders his pinkish hair and calm unwavering eyes So he knew things about her own family which she had not troubled to discover So that was why Carreen mooned about praying all the time Well shed get over it Lots of girls got over dead sweethearts yes dead husbands too Shed certainly gotten over Charles And she knew one girl in Atlanta who had been widowed three times by the war and was still able to take notice of men She said as much to Will but he shook his head Not Miss Carreen he said with finality Will was pleasant to talk to because he had so little to say and yet was so understanding a listener She told him about her problems of weeding and hoeing and planting of fattening the hogs and breeding the cow and he gave good advice for he had owned a small farm in south Georgia and two negroes He knew his slaves were free now and the farm gone to weeds and seedling pines His sister his only relative had moved to Texas with her husband years ago and he was alone in the world Yet  Page    Gone With The Wind none of these things seemed to bother him any more than the leg he had left in Virginia Yes Will was a comfort to Scarlett after hard days when the negroes muttered and Suellen nagged and cried and Gerald asked too frequently where Ellen was She could tell Will anything She even told him of killing the Yankee and glowed with pride when he commented briefly Good work Eventually all the family found their way to Wills room to air their troubleseven Mammy who had at first been distant with him because he was not quality and had owned only two slaves When he was able to totter about the house he turned his hands to weaving baskets of split oak and mending the furniture ruined by the Yankees He was clever at whittling and Wade was constantly by his side for he whittled out toys for him the only toys the little boy had With Will in the house everyone felt safe in leaving Wade and the two babies while they went about their tasks for he could care for them as deftly as Mammy and only Melly surpassed him at soothing the screaming black and white babies Youve been mighty good to me Miss Scarlett he said and me a stranger and nothin to you all Ive caused you a heap of trouble and worry and if its all the same to you Im goin to stay here and help you all with the work till Ive paid you back some for your trouble I cant ever pay it all cause there aint no payment a man can give for his life So he stayed and gradually unobtrusively a large part of the burden of Tara shifted from Scarletts shoulders to the bony shoulders of Will Benteen It was September and time to pick the cotton Will Benteen sat on the front steps at Scarletts feet in the pleasant sunshine of the early autumn afternoon and his flat voice went on and on languidly about the exorbitant costs of ginning the cotton at the new gin near Fayetteville However he had learned that day in Fayetteville that he could cut this expense a fourth by lending the horse and wagon for two weeks to the gin owner He had delayed closing the bargain until he discussed it with Scarlett She looked at the lank figure leaning against the porch column chewing a straw Undoubtedly as Mammy frequently declared Will was something the Lord had provided and Scarlett often wondered how Tara could have lived through the last few months without him He never had much to say never displayed any energy never seemed to take much interest in anything that went on about him but he knew everything about everybody at Tara And he did things He did them silently patiently and competently Though he had only one leg he could work faster than Pork And he could get work out of Pork which was to Scarlett a marvelous thing When the cow had the colic and the horse fell ill with a mysterious ailment which threatened to remove him permanently from them Will sat up nights with them and saved them That he was a shrewd trader brought him Scarletts respect for he could ride out in the mornings with a bushel or two of apples sweet potatoes and other vegetables and return with seeds lengths of cloth flour and other necessities which she knew she could never have acquired good trader though she was He had gradually slipped into the status of a member of the family and slept on a cot in the little dressing room off Geralds room He said nothing of leaving Tara and Scarlett was careful not to question him fearful that he might leave them Sometimes she thought that if he were anybody and had any gumption he would go home even if he no longer had a home But even with this thought she would pray fervently that he would remain indefinitely It was so convenient to have a man about the house She thought too that if Carreen had the sense of a mouse she would see that Will cared for her Scarlett would have been eternally grateful to Will had he asked her for Carreens hand Of course before the war Will would certainly not have been an eligible suitor He was not of the planter class at all though he was not poor white He was just plain Cracker a small farmer halfeducated prone to grammatical errors and ignorant of some of the finer manners the OHaras were accustomed to in gentlemen In fact Scarlett wondered if he could be called a gentleman at all and decided that he couldnt Melanie hotly defended him saying that anyone who had Wills kind heart and thoughtfulness of others was of gentle birth Scarlett knew that Ellen would have fainted at the thought of a daughter of hers marrying such a man but now Scarlett had been by necessity forced too far away from Ellens teachings to let that worry her Men were scarce girls had to marry someone and Tara had to have a man But Carreen deeper and deeper immersed in her prayer book and every day losing more of her touch with the world of realities treated Will as gently as a brother and took him as much for granted as she did Pork If Carreen had any sense of gratitude to me for what Ive done for her shed marry him and not let him get away from here Scarlett thought indignantly But no she must spend her time mooning about a silly boy who probably never gave her a serious thought So Will remained at Tara for what reason she did not know and she found his businesslike mantoman attitude with her both pleasant and helpful He was gravely deferential to the vague Gerald but it was to Scarlett that he turned as the real head of the house She gave her approval to the plan of hiring out the horse even though it meant the family would be without any means of transportation temporarily Suellen would be especially grieved at this Her greatest joy lay in going to Jonesboro or Fayetteville with Will when he drove over on business Adorned in the assembled best of the family she called on old friends heard all the gossip of the County and felt herself again Miss OHara of Tara Suellen never missed the opportunity to leave the plantation and give herself airs among people who did not know she weeded the garden and made beds Miss Fine Airs will just have to do without gadding for two weeks thought Scarlett and well have to put up with her nagging and her bawling Melanie joined them on the veranda the baby in her arms and spreading an old blanket on the floor set little Beau down to crawl Since Ashleys letter Melanie had divided her time between glowing singing happiness and anxious longing But happy or depressed she was too thin too white She did her share of the work uncomplainingly but she was always ailing Old Dr Fontaine diagnosed her trouble as female complaint and concurred with Dr Meade in saying she should never have had Beau And he said frankly that another baby would kill her When I was over to Fayetteville today said Will I found somethin right cute that I thought would interest you ladies and I brought it home He fumbled in his back pants pocket and brought out the wallet of calico stiffened with bark which Carreen had made him From it he drew a Confederate bill  Page    Gone With The Wind If you think Confederate money is cute Will I certainly dont said Scarlett shortly for the very sight of Confederate money made her mad Weve got three thousand dollars of it in Pas trunk this minute and Mammys after me to let her paste it over the holes in the attic walls so the draft wont get her And I think Ill do it Then itll be good for something  Imperious Caesar dead and turned to clay  said Melanie with a sad smile Dont do that Scarlett Keep it for Wade Hell be proud of it some day Well I dont know nothin about imperious Caesar said Will patiently but what Ive got is in line with what youve just said about Wade Miss Melly Its a poem pasted on the back of this bill I know Miss Scarlett aint much on poems but I thought this might interest her He turned the bill over On its back was pasted a strip of coarse brown wrapping paper inscribed in pale homemade ink Will cleared his throat and read slowly and with difficulty The name is Lines on the Back of a Confederate Note  he said Representing nothing on Gods earth now And naught in the waters below it As the pledge of nation thats passed away Keep it dear friend and show it Show it to those who will lend an ear To the tale this trifle will tell Of Liberty born of patriots dream Of a stormcradled nation that fell Oh how beautiful How touching cried Melanie Scarlett you mustnt give the money to Mammy to paste in the attic Its more than paperjust like this poem said The pledge of a nation thats passed away  Oh Melly dont be sentimental Paper is paper and weve got little enough of it and Im tired of hearing Mammy grumble about the cracks in the attic I hope when Wade grows up Ill have plenty of greenbacks to give him instead of Confederate trash Will who had been enticing little Beau across the blanket with the bill during this argument looked up and shading his eyes glanced down the driveway More company he said squinting in the sun Another soldier Scarlett followed his gaze and saw a familiar sight a bearded man coming slowly up the avenue under the cedars a man clad in a ragged mixture of blue and gray uniforms head bowed tiredly feet dragging slowly I thought we were about through with soldiers she said I hope this one isnt very hungry Hell be hungry said Will briefly Melanie rose Id better tell Dilcey to set an extra plate she said and warn Mammy not to get the poor things clothes off his back too abruptly and She stopped so suddenly that Scarlett turned to look at her Melanies thin hand was at her throat clutching it as if it was torn with pain and Scarlett could see the veins beneath the white skin throbbing swiftly Her face went whiter and her brown eyes dilated enormously Shes going to faint thought Scarlett leaping to her feet and catching her arm But in an instant Melanie threw off her hand and was down the steps Down the graveled path she flew skimming lightly as a bird her faded skirts streaming behind her her arms outstretched Then Scarlett knew the truth with the impact of a blow She reeled back against an upright of the porch as the man lifted a face covered with a dirty blond beard and stopped still looking toward the house as if he was too weary to take another step Her heart leaped and stopped and then began racing as Melly with incoherent cries threw herself into the dirty soldiers arms and his head bent down toward hers With rapture Scarlett took two running steps forward but was checked when Wills hand closed upon her skirt Dont spoil it he said quietly Turn me loose you fool Turn me loose Its Ashley He did not relax his grip After all hes her husband aint he Will asked calmly and looking down at him in a confusion of joy and impotent fury Scarlett saw in the quiet depths of his eyes understanding and pity Part Four CHAPTER XXXI ON A COLD January afternoon in  Scarlett sat in the office writing a letter to Aunt Pitty explaining in detail for the tenth time why neither she Melanie nor Ashley could come back to Atlanta to live with her She wrote impatiently because she knew Aunt Pitty would read no farther than the opening lines and then write her again wailing But Im afraid to live by myself  Her hands were chilled and she paused to rub them together and to scuff her feet deeper into the strip of old quilting wrapped about them The soles of her slippers were practically gone and were reinforced with pieces of carpet The carpet kept her feet off the floor but did little to keep them warm That morning Will had taken the horse to Jonesboro to get him shod Scarlett thought grimly that things were indeed at a pretty pass when horses had shoes and peoples feet were as bare as yard dogs She picked up her quill to resume her writing but laid it down when she heard Will coming in at the back door She heard the thumpthump of his wooden leg in the hall outside the office and then he stopped She waited for a moment for him to enter and when he made no move she called to him He came in his ears red from the cold his pinkish hair awry and stood looking down  Page    Gone With The Wind at her a faintly humorous smile on his lips Miss Scarlett he questioned just how much cash money have you got Are you going to try to marry me for my money Will she asked somewhat crossly No Mam But I just wanted to know She stared at him inquiringly Will didnt look serious but then he never looked serious However she felt that something was wrong Ive got ten dollars in gold she said The last of that Yankees money Well Mam that wont be enough Enough for what Enough for the taxes he answered and stumping over to the fireplace he leaned down and held his red hands to the blaze Taxes she repeated Name of God Will Weve already paid the taxes Yesm But they say you didnt pay enough I heard about it today over to Jonesboro But Will I cant understand What do you mean Miss Scarlett I sure hate to bother you with more trouble when youve had your share but Ive got to tell you They say you ought to paid lots more taxes than you did Theyre runnin the assessment up on Tara sky highhigher than any in the County Ill be bound But they cant make us pay more taxes when weve already paid them once Miss Scarlett you dont never go to Jonesboro often and Im glad you dont It aint no place for a lady these days But if youd been there much youd know theres a mighty rough bunch of Scallawags and Republicans and Carpetbaggers been runnin things recently Theyd make you mad enough to pop And then too niggers pushin white folks off the sidewalks and But whats that got to do with our taxes Im gettin to it Miss Scarlett For some reason the rascals have histed the taxes on Tara till youd think it was a thousandbale place After I heard about it I sorter oozed around the barrooms pickin up gossip and I found out that somebody wants to buy in Tara cheap at the sheriffs sale if you cant pay the extra taxes And everybody knows pretty well that you cant pay them I dont know yet who it is wants this place I couldnt find out But I think that pusillanimous feller Hilton that married Miss Cathleen knows because he laughed kind of nasty when I tried to sound him out Will sat down on the sofa and rubbed the stump of his leg It ached in cold weather and the wooden peg was neither well padded nor comfortable Scarlett looked at him wildly His manner was so casual when he was sounding the death knell of Tara Sold out at the sheriffs sale Where would they all go And Tara belonging to some one else No that was unthinkable She had been so engrossed with the job of making Tara produce she had paid little heed to what was going on in the world outside Now that she had Will and Ashley to attend to whatever business she might have in Jonesboro and Fayetteville she seldom left the plantation And even as she had listened with deaf ears to her fathers war talk in the days before the war came so she had paid little heed to Will and Ashleys discussions around the table after supper about the beginnings of Reconstruction Oh of course she knew about the ScalawagsSoutherners who had turned Republican very profitablyand the Carpetbaggers those Yankees who came South like buzzards after the surrender with all their worldly possessions in one carpetbag And she had had a few unpleasant experiences with the Freedmens Bureau She had gathered also that some of the free negroes were getting quite insolent This last she could hardly believe for she had never seen an insolent negro in her life But there were many things which Will and Ashley had conspired to keep from her The scourge of war had been followed by the worse scourge of Reconstruction but the two men had agreed not to mention the more alarming details when they discussed the situation at home And when Scarlett took the trouble to listen to them at all most of what they said went in one ear and out the other She had heard Ashley say that the South was being treated as a conquered province and that vindictiveness was the dominant policy of the conquerors But that was the kind of statement which meant less than nothing at all to Scarlett Politics was mens business She had heard Will say it looked to him like the North just wasnt aiming to let the South get on its feet again Well thought Scarlett men always had to have something foolish to worry about As far as she was concerned the Yankees hadnt whipped her once and they wouldnt do it this time The thing to do was to work like the devil and stop worrying about the Yankee government After all the war was over Scarlett did not realize that all the rules of the game had been changed and that honest labor could no longer earn its just reward Georgia was virtually under martial law now The Yankee soldiers garrisoned throughout the section and the Freedmens Bureau were in complete command of everything and they were fixing the rules to suit themselves This Bureau organized by the Federal government to take care of the idle and excited exslaves was drawing them from the plantations into the villages and cities by the thousands The Bureau fed them while they loafed and poisoned their minds against their former owners Geralds old overseer Jonas Wilkerson was in charge of the local Bureau and his assistant was Hilton Cathleen Calverts husband These two industriously spread the rumor that the Southerners and Democrats were just waiting for a good chance to put the negroes back into slavery and that the negroes only hope of escaping this fate was the protection given them by the Bureau and the Republican party Wilkerson and Hilton furthermore told the negroes they were as good as the whites in every way and soon white and negro marriages would be permitted soon the estates of their former owners would be divided and every negro would be given forty acres and a mule for his own They kept the negroes stirred up with tales of cruelty perpetrated by the whites and in a section long famed for the affectionate relations between slaves and slave owners hate and suspicion began to grow The Bureau was backed up by the soldiers and the military had issued many and conflicting orders governing the conduct of the conquered It was easy to get arrested even for snubbing the officials of the Bureau Military orders had been promulgated concerning the schools sanitation the kind of buttons one wore on ones suit the sale of commodities and nearly everything else Wilkerson and Hilton had the power to interfere in any trade Scarlett might make and to fix their own prices on anything she sold  Page    Gone With The Wind or swapped Fortunately Scarlett had come into contact with the two men very little for Will had persuaded her to let him handle the trading while she managed the plantation In his mildtempered way Will had straightened out several difficulties of this kind and said nothing to her about them Will could get along with Carpetbaggers and Yankeesif he had to But now a problem had arisen which was too big for him to handle The extra tax assessment and the danger of losing Tara were matters Scarlett had to know aboutand right away She looked at him with flashing eyes Oh damn the Yankees she cried Isnt it enough that theyve licked us and beggared us without turning loose scoundrels on us The war was over peace had been declared but the Yankees could still rob her they could still starve her they could still drive her from her house And fool that she was she had thought through weary months that if she could just hold out until spring everything would be all right This crushing news brought by Will coming on top of a year of backbreaking work and hope deferred was the last straw Oh Will and I thought our troubles were all over when the war ended Nom Will raised his lanternjawed countrylooking face and gave her a long steady look Our troubles are just gettin started How much extra taxes do they want us to pay Three hundred dollars She was struck dumb for a moment Three hundred dollars It might just as well be three million dollars Why she floundered whywhy then weve got to raise three hundred somehow Yesmadd a rainbow and a moon or two Oh but Will They couldnt sell out Tara Why His mild pale eyes showed more hate and bitterness than she thought possible Oh couldnt they Well they could and they will and theyll like doin it Miss Scarlett the countrys gone plumb to hell if youll pardon me Those Carpetbaggers and Scalawags can vote and most of us Democrats cant Cant no Democrat in this state vote if he was on the tax books for more than two thousand dollars in sixtyfive That lets out folks like your pa and Mr Tarleton and the McRaes and the Fontaine boys Cant nobody vote who was a colonel and over in the war and Miss Scarlett I bet this states got more colonels than any state in the Confederacy And cant nobody vote who held office under the Confederate government and that lets out everybody from the notaries to the judges and the woods are full of folks like that Fact is the way the Yankees have framed up that amnesty oath cant nobody who was somebody before the war vote at all Not the smart folks nor the quality folks nor the rich folks Huh I could vote if I took their damned oath I didnt have any money in sixtyfive and I certainly warnt a colonel or nothin remarkable But I aint goin to take their oath Not by a dinged sight If the Yankees had acted right Id have taken their oath of allegiance but I aint now I can be restored to the Union but I cant be reconstructed into it I aint goin to take their oath even if I dont never vote again But scum like that Hilton feller he can vote and scoundrels like Jonas Wilkerson and pore whites like the Slatterys and nocounts like the Macintoshes they can vote And theyre runnin things now And if they want to come down on you for extra taxes a dozen times they can do it Just like a nigger can kill a white man and not get hung or He paused embarrassed and the memory of what had happened to a lone white woman on an isolated farm near Lovejoy was in both their minds  Those niggers can do anything against us and the Freedmens Bureau and the soldiers will back them up with guns and we cant vote or do nothin about it Vote she cried Vote What on earth has voting got to do with all this Will Its taxes were talking about  Will everybody knows what a good plantation Tara is We could mortgage it for enough to pay the taxes if we had to Miss Scarlett you aint any fool but sometimes you talk like one Whos got any money to lend you on this property Who except the Carpetbaggers who are tryin to take Tara away from you Why everybodys got land Everybodys land pore You cant give away land Ive got those diamond earbobs I got off that Yankee We could sell them Miss Scarlett who round here has got money for earbobs Folks aint got money to buy side meat let alone gewgaws If youve got ten dollars in gold I take oath thats more than most folks have got They were silent again and Scarlett felt as if she were butting her head against a stone wall There had been so many stone walls to butt against this last year What are we goin to do Miss Scarlett I dont know she said dully and felt that she didnt care This was one stone wall too many and she suddenly felt so tired that her bones ached Why should she work and struggle and wear herself out At the end of every struggle it seemed that defeat was waiting to mock her I dont know she said But dont let Pa know It might worry him I wont Have you told anyone No I came right to you Yes she thought everyone always came right to her with bad news and she was tired of it Where is Mr Wilkes Perhaps hell have some suggestion Will turned his mild gaze on her and she felt as from the first day when Ashley came home that he knew everything Hes down in the orchard splittin rails I heard his axe when I was puttin up the horse But he aint got any money any more than we have If I want to talk to him about it I can cant I she snapped rising to her feet and kicking the fragment of quilting from her ankles  Page    Gone With The Wind Will did not take offense but continued rubbing his hands before the flame Better get your shawl Miss Scarlett Its raw outside But she went without the shawl for it was upstairs and her need to see Ashley and lay her troubles before him was too urgent to wait How lucky for her if she could find him alone Never once since his return had she had a private word with him Always the family clustered about him always Melanie was by his side touching his sleeve now and again to reassure herself he was really there The sight of that happy possessive gesture had aroused in Scarlett all the jealous animosity which had slumbered during the months when she had thought Ashley probably dead Now she was determined to see him alone This time no one was going to prevent her from talking with him alone She went through the orchard under the bare boughs and the damp weeds beneath them wet her feet She could hear the sound of the axe ringing as Ashley split into rails the logs hauled from the swamp Replacing the fences the Yankees had so blithely burned was a long hard task Everything was a long hard task she thought wearily and she was tired of it tired and mad and sick of it all If only Ashley were her husband instead of Melanies how sweet it would be to go to him and lay her head upon his shoulder and cry and shove her burdens onto him to work out as best he might She rounded a thicket of pomegranate trees which were shaking bare limbs in the cold wind and saw him leaning on his axe wiping his forehead with the back of his hand He was wearing the remains of his butternut trousers and one of Geralds shirts a shirt which in better times went only to Court days and barbecues a ruffled shirt which was far too short for its present owner He had hung his coat on a tree limb for the work was hot and he stood resting as she came up to him At the sight of Ashley in rags with an axe in his hand her heart went out in a surge of love and of fury at fate She could not bear to see him in tatters working her debonair immaculate Ashley His hands were not made for work or his body for anything but broadcloth and fine linen God intended him to sit in a great house talking with pleasant people playing the piano and writing things which sounded beautiful and made no sense whatsoever She could endure the sight of her own child in aprons made of sacking and the girls in dingy old gingham could bear it that Will worked harder than any field hand but not Ashley He was too fine for all this too infinitely dear to her She would rather split logs herself than suffer while he did it They say Abe Lincoln got his start splitting rails he said as she came up to him Just think to what heights I may climb  She frowned He was always saying light things like this about their hardships They were deadly serious matters to her and sometimes she was almost irritated at his remarks Abruptly she told him Wills news tersely and in short words feeling a sense of relief as she spoke Surely hed have something helpful to offer He said nothing but seeing her shiver he took his coat and placed it about her shoulders Well she said finally doesnt it occur to you that well have to get the money somewhere Yes he said but where Im asking you she replied annoyed The sense of relief at unburdening herself had disappeared Even if he couldnt help why didnt he say something comforting even if it was only Oh Im so sorry He smiled In all these months since Ive been home Ive only heard of one person Rhett Butler who actually has money he said Aunt Pittypat had written Melanie the week before that Rhett was back in Atlanta with a carriage and two fine horses and pocketfuls of greenbacks She had intimated however that he didnt come by them honestly Aunt Pitty had a theory largely shared by Atlanta that Rhett had managed to get away with the mythical millions of the Confederate treasury Dont lets talk about him said Scarlett shortly Hes a skunk if ever there was one Whats to become of us all Ashley put down the axe and looked away and his eyes seemed to be journeying to some faroff country where she could not follow I wonder he said I wonder not only what will become of us at Tara but what will become of everybody in the South She felt like snapping out abruptly To hell with everybody in the South What about us but she remained silent because the tired feeling was back on her more strongly than ever Ashley wasnt being any help at all In the end what will happen will be what has happened whenever a civilization breaks up The people who have brains and courage come through and the ones who havent are winnowed out At least it has been interesting if not comfortable to witness a Gtterdmmerung A what A dusk of the gods Unfortunately we Southerners did think we were gods For Heavens sake Ashley Wilkes Dont stand there and talk nonsense at me when its us who are going to be winnowed out Something of her exasperated weariness seemed to penetrate his mind calling it back from its wanderings for he raised her hands with tenderness and turning them palm up looked at the calluses These are the most beautiful hands I know he said and kissed each palm lightly They are beautiful because they are strong and every callus is a medal Scarlett every blister an award for bravery and unselfishness Theyve been roughened for all of us your father the girls Melanie the baby the negroes and for me My dear I know what you are thinking Youre thinking Here stands an impractical fool talking tommyrot about dead gods when living people are in danger Isnt that true She nodded wishing he would keep on holding her hands forever but he dropped them And you came to me hoping I could help you Well I cant His eyes were bitter as he looked toward the axe and the pile of logs My home is gone and all the money that I so took for granted I never realized I had it And I am fitted for nothing in this world for the world I belonged in has gone I cant help you Scarlett except by learning with as good grace as possible to be a clumsy farmer And that wont keep Tara for you Dont you think I realize the bitterness of our situation living here on your charity  Page    Gone With The Wind Oh yes Scarlett your charity I can never repay you what youve done for me and for mine out of the kindness of your heart I realize it more acutely every day And every day I see more clearly how helpless I am to cope with what has come on us all Every day my accursed shrinking from realities makes it harder for me to face the new realities Do you know what I mean She nodded She had no very clear idea what he meant but she clung breathlessly on his words this was the first time he had ever spoken to her of the things he was thinking when he seemed so remote from her It excited her as if she were on the brink of a discovery Its a cursethis not wanting to look on naked realities Until the war life was never more real to me than a shadow show on a curtain And I preferred it so I do not like the outlines of things to be too sharp I like them gently blurred a little hazy He stopped and smiled faintly shivering a little as the cold wind went through his thin shirt In other words Scarlett I am a coward His talk of shadow shows and hazy outlines conveyedno meaning to her but his last words were in language she could understand She knew they were untrue Cowardice was not in him Every line of his slender body spoke of generations of brave and gallant men and Scarlett knew his war record by heart Why thats not so Would a coward have climbed on the cannon at Gettysburg and rallied the men Would the General himself have written Melanie a letter about a coward And Thats not courage he said tiredly Fighting is like champagne It goes to the heads of cowards as quickly as of heroes Any fool can be brave on a battle field when its be brave or else be killed Im talking of something else And my kind of cowardice is infinitely worse than if I had run the first time I heard a cannon fired His words came slowly and with difficulty as if it hurt to speak them and he seemed to stand off and look with a sad heart at what he had said Had any other man spoken so Scarlett would have dismissed such protestations contemptuously as mock modesty and a bid for praise But Ashley seemed to mean them and there was a look in his eyes which eluded hernot fear not apology but the bracing to a strain which was inevitable and overwhelming The wintry wind swept her damp ankles and she shivered again but her shiver was less from the wind than from the dread his words evoked in her heart But Ashley what are you afraid of Oh nameless things Things which sound very silly when they are put into words Mostly of having life suddenly become too real of being brought into personal too personal contact with some of the simple facts of life It isnt that I mind splitting logs here in the mud but I do mind what it stands for I do mind very much the loss of the beauty of the old life I loved Scarlett before the war life was beautiful There was a glamour to it a perfection and a completeness and a symmetry to it like Grecian art Maybe it wasnt so to everyone I know that now But to me living at Twelve Oaks there was a real beauty to living I belonged in that life I was a part of it And now it is gone and I am out of place in this new life and I am afraid Now I know that in the old days it was a shadow show I watched I avoided everything which was not shadowy people and situations which were too real too vital I resented their intrusion I tried to avoid you too Scarlett You were too full of living and too real and I was cowardly enough to prefer shadows and dreams ButbutMelly Melanie is the gentlest of dreams and a part of my dreaming And if the war had not come I would have lived out my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks contentedly watching life go by and never being a part of it But when the war came life as it really is thrust itself against me The first time I went into actionit was at Bull Run you rememberI saw my boyhood friends blown to bits and heard dying horses scream and learned the sickeningly horrible feeling of seeing men crumple up and spit blood when I shot them But those werent the worst things about the war Scarlett The worst thing about the war was the people I had to live with I had sheltered myself from people an my life I had carefully selected my few friends But the war taught me I had created a world of my own with dream people in it It taught me what people really are but it didnt teach me how to live with them And Im afraid Ill never learn Now I know that in order to support my wife and child I will have to make my way among a world of people with whom I have nothing in common You Scarlett are taking life by the horns and twisting it to your will But where do I fit in the world any more I tell you I am afraid While his low resonant voice went on desolate with a feeling she could not understand Scarlett clutched at words here and there trying to make sense of them But the words swooped from her hands like wild birds Something was driving him driving him with a cruel goad but she did not understand what it was Scarlett I dont know just when it was that the bleak realization came over me that my own private shadow show was over Perhaps in the first five minutes at Bull Run when I saw the first man I killed drop to the ground But I knew it was over and I could no longer be a spectator No I suddenly found myself on the curtain an actor posturing and making futile gestures My little inner world was gone invaded by people whose thoughts were not my thoughts whose actions were as alien as a Hottentots Theyd tramped through my world with slimy feet and there was no place left where I could take refuge when things became too bad to stand When I was in prison I thought When the war is over I can go back to the old life and the old dreams and watch the shadow show again But Scarlett theres no going back And this which is facing all of us now is worse than war and worse than prisonand to me worse than death  So you see Scarlett Im being punished for being afraid But Ashley she began floundering in a quagmire of bewilderment if youre afraid well starve whywhy Oh Ashley well manage somehow I know we will For a moment his eyes came back to her wide and crystal gray and there was admiration in them Then suddenly they were remote again and she knew with a sinking heart that he had not been thinking about starving They were always like two people talking to each other in different languages But she loved him so much that when he withdrew as he had now done it was like the warm son going down and leaving her in chilly twilight dews She wanted to catch him by the shoulders and hug him to her make him realize that she was flesh and blood and not something he had read or dreamed If she could only feel that sense of oneness with him for which she had yearned since that day so long ago when he had come home from Europe and stood on the steps of Tara and smiled up at her  Page    Gone With The Wind Starvings not pleasant he said I know for Ive starved but Im not afraid of that I am afraid of facing life without the slow beauty of our old world that is gone Scarlett thought despairingly that Melanie would know what he meant Melly and he were always talking such foolishness poetry and books and dreams and moonrays and star dust He was not fearing the things she feared not the gnawing of an empty stomach nor the keenness of the winter wind nor eviction from Tara He was shrinking before some fear she had never known and could not imagine For in Gods name what was there to fear in this wreck of a world but hunger and cold and the loss of home And she had thought that if she listened closely she would know the answer to Ashley Oh she said and the disappointment in her voice was that of a child who opens a beautifully wrapped package to find it empty At her tone he smiled ruefully as though apologizing Forgive me Scarlett for talking so I cant make you understand because you dont know the meaning of fear You have the heart of a lion and an utter lack of imagination and I envy you both of those qualities Youll never mind facing realities and youll never want to escape from them as I do Escape It was as if that were the only understandable word he had spoken Ashley like her was tired of the struggle and he wanted to escape Her breath came fast Oh Ashley she cried youre wrong I do want to escape too I am so very tired of it all His eyebrows went up in disbelief and she laid a hand feverish and urgent on his arm Listen to me she began swiftly the words tumbling out one over the other Im tired of it all I tell you Bone tired and Im not going to stand it any longer Ive struggled for food and for money and Ive weeded and hoed and picked cotton and Ive even plowed until I cant stand it another minute I tell you Ashley the South is dead Its dead The Yankees and the free niggers and the Carpetbaggers have got it and theres nothing left for us Ashley lets run away He peered at her sharply lowering his head to look into her face now flaming with color Yes lets run awayleave them all Im tired of working for the folks Somebody will take care of them Theres always somebody who takes care of people who cant take care of themselves Oh Ashley lets run away you and I We could go to Mexicothey want officers in the Mexican Army and we could be so happy there Id work for you Ashley Id do anything for you You know you dont love Melanie He started to speak a stricken look on his face but she stemmed his words with a torrent of her own You told me you loved me better than her that day oh you remember that day And I know you havent changed I can tell you havent changed And youve just said she was nothing but a dream Oh Ashley lets go away I could make you so happy And anyway she added venomously Melanie cant Dr Fontaine said she couldnt ever have any more children and I could give you His hands were on her shoulders so tightly that they hurt and she stopped breathless We were to forget that day at Twelve Oaks Do you think I could ever forget it Have you forgotten it Can you honestly say you dont love me He drew a deep breath and answered quickly No I dont love you Thats a lie Even if it is a lie said Ashley and his voice was deadly quiet it is not something which can be discussed You mean Do you think I could go off and leave Melanie and the baby even if I hated them both Break Melanies heart Leave them both to the charity of friends Scarlett are you mad Isnt there any sense of loyalty in you You couldnt leave your father and the girls Theyre your responsibility just as Melanie and Beau are mine and whether you are tired or not they are here and youve got to bear them I could leave themIm sick of themtired of them He leaned toward her and for a moment she thought with a catch at her heart that he was going to take her in his arms But instead he patted her arm and spoke as one comforting a child I know youre sick and tired Thats why you are talking this way Youve carried the load of three men But Im going to help youI wont always be so awkward Theres only one way you can help me she said dully and thats to take me away from here and give us a new start somewhere with a chance for happiness Theres nothing to keep us here Nothing he said quietly nothingexcept honor She looked at him with baffled longing and saw as if for the first time how the crescents of his lashes were the thick rich gold of ripe wheat how proudly his head sat upon his bared neck and how the look of race and dignity persisted in his slim erect body even through its grotesque rags Her eyes met his hers naked with pleading his remote as mountain lakes under gray skies She saw in them defeat of her wild dream her mad desires Heartbreak and weariness sweeping over her she dropped her head in her hands and cried He had never seen her cry He had never thought that women of her strong mettle had tears and a flood of tenderness and remorse swept him He came to her swiftly and in a moment had her in his arms cradling her comfortingly pressing her black head to his heart whispering Dear My brave deardont You mustnt cry At his touch he felt her change within his grip and there was madness and magic in the slim body he held and a hot soft glow in the green eyes which looked up at him Of a sudden it was no longer bleak winter For Ashley spring was back again that halfforgotten balmy spring of green rustlings and murmurings a spring of ease and indolence careless days when the desires of youth were warm in his body The bitter years since then fell away and he saw that the lips turned up to his were red and trembling and he kissed her  Page    Gone With The Wind There was a curious low roaring sound in her ears as of sea shells held against them and through the sound she dimly heard the swift thudding of her heart Her body seemed to melt into his and for a timeless time they stood fused together as his lips took hers hungrily as if he could never have enough When he suddenly released her she felt that she could not stand alone and gripped the fence for support She raised eyes blazing with love and triumph to him You do love me You do love me Say itsay it His hands still rested on her shoulders and she felt them tremble and loved their trembling She leaned toward him ardently but he held her away from him looking at her with eyes from which all remoteness had fled eyes tormented with struggle and despair Dont he said Dont If you do I shall take you now here She smiled a bright hot smile which was forgetful of time or place or anything but the memory of his mouth on hers Suddenly he shook her shook her until her black hair tumbled down about her shoulders shook her as if in a mad rage at herand at himself We wont do this he said I tell you we wont do it It seemed as if her neck would snap if he shook her again She was blinded by her hair and stunned by his action She wrenched herself away and stared at him There were small beads of moisture on his forehead and his fists were curled into claws as if in pain He looked at her directly his gray eyes piercing Its all my faultnone of yours and it will never happen again because I am going to take Melanie and the baby and go Go she cried in anguish Oh no Yes by God Do you think Ill stay here after this When this might happen again But Ashley you cant go Why should you go You love me You want me to say it All right Ill say it I love you He leaned over her with a sudden savagery which made her shrink back against the fence I love you your courage and your stubbornness and your fire and your utter ruthlessness How much do I love you So much that a moment ago I would have outraged the hospitality of the house which has sheltered me and my family forgotten the best wife any man ever hadenough to take you here in the mud like a She struggled with a chaos of thoughts and there was a cold pain in her heart as if an icicle had pierced it She said haltingly If you felt like thatand didnt take methen you dont love me I can never make you understand They fell silent and looked at each other Suddenly Scarlett shivered and saw as if coming back from a long journey that it was winter and the fields were bare and harsh with stubble and she was very cold She saw too that the old aloof face of Ashley the one she knew so well had come back and it was wintry too and harsh with hurt and remorse She would have turned and left him then seeking the shelter of the house to hide herself but she was too tired to move Even speech was a labor and a weariness There is nothing left she said at last Nothing left for me Nothing to love Nothing to fight for You are gone and Tara is going He looked at her for a long space and then leaning scooped up a small wad of red clay from the ground Yes there is something left he said and the ghost of his old smile came back the smile which mocked himself as well as her Something you love better than me though you may not know it Youve still got Tara He took her limp hand and pressed the damp clay into it and closed her fingers about it There was no fever in his hands now nor in hers She looked at the red soil for a moment and it meant nothing to her She looked at him and realized dimly that there was an integrity of spirit in him which was not to be torn apart by her passionate hands nor by any hands If it killed him he would never leave Melanie If he burned for Scarlett until the end of his days he would never take her and he would fight to keep her at a distance She would never again get through that armor The words hospitality and loyalty and honor meant more to him than she did The clay was cold in her hand and she looked at it again Yes she said Ive still got this At first the words meant nothing and the clay was only red clay But unbidden came the thought of the sea of red dirt which surrounded Tara and how very dear it was and how hard she had fought to keep ithow hard she was going to have to fight if she wished to keep it hereafter She looked at him again and wondered where the hot flood of feeling had gone She could think but could not feel not about him nor Tara either for she was drained of all emotion You need not go she said clearly I wont have you all starve simply because Ive thrown myself at your head It will never happen again She turned away and started back toward the house across the rough fields twisting her hair into a knot upon her neck Ashley watched her go and saw her square her small thin shoulders as she went And that gesture went to his heart more than any words she had spoken CHAPTER XXXII SHE WAS STILL CLUTCHING the ball of red clay when she went up the front steps She had carefully avoided the back entrance for Mammys sharp eyes would certainly have seen that something was greatly amiss Scarlett did not want to see Mammy or anyone else She did not feel that she could endure seeing anyone or talking to anyone again She had no feeling of shame or disappointment or bitterness now only a weakness of the knees and a great emptiness of heart She squeezed the clay so tightly it ran out from her clenched fist and she said over and over parrotlike Ive still got this Yes Ive still got this There was nothing else she did have nothing but this red land this land she had been willing to throw away like a torn  Page    Gone With The Wind handkerchief only a few minutes before Now it was dear to her again and she wondered dully what madness had possessed her to hold it so lightly Had Ashley yielded she could have gone away with him and left family and friends without a backward look but even in her emptiness she knew it would have torn her heart to leave these dear red hills and long washed gullies and gaunt black pines Her thoughts would have turned back to them hungrily until the day she died Not even Ashley could have filled the empty spaces in her heart where Tara had been uprooted How wise Ashley was and how well he knew her He had only to press the damp earth into her hand to bring her to her senses She was in the hall preparing to close the door when she heard the sound of horses hooves and turned to look down the driveway To have visitors at this of all times was too much Shed hurry to her room and plead a headache But when the carriage came nearer her flight was checked by her amazement It was a new carriage shiny with varnish and the harness was new too with bits of polished brass here and there Strangers certainly No one she knew had the money for such a grand new turnout as this She stood in the doorway watching the cold draft blowing her skirts about her damp ankles Then the carriage stopped in front of the house and Jonas Wilkerson alighted Scarlett was so surprised at the sight of their former overseer driving so fine a rig and in so splendid a greatcoat she could not for a moment believe her eyes Will had told her he looked quite prosperous since he got his new job with the Freedmens Bureau Made a lot of money Will said swindling the niggers or the government one or tuther or confiscating folks cotton and swearing it was Confederate government cotton Certainly he never came by all that money honestly in these hard times And here he was now stepping out of an elegant carriage and handing down a woman dressed within an inch of her life Scarlett saw in a glance that the dress was bright in color to the point of vulgarity but nevertheless her eyes went over the outfit hungrily It had been so long since she had even seen stylish new clothes Well So hoops arent so wide this year she thought scanning the red plaid gown And as she took in the black velvet paletot how short jackets are And what a cunning hat Bonnets must be out of style for this hat was only an absurd flat red velvet affair perched on the top of the womans head like a stiffened pancake The ribbons did not tie under the chin as bonnet ribbons tied but in the back under the massive bunch of curls which fell from the rear of the hat curls which Scarlett could not help noticing did not match the womans hair in either color or texture As the woman stepped to the ground and looked toward the house Scarlett saw there was something familiar about the rabbity face caked with white powder Why its Emmie Slattery she cried so surprised she spoke the words aloud Yesm its me said Emmie tossing her head with an ingratiating smile and starting toward the steps Emmie Slattery The dirty towheaded slut whose illegitimate baby Ellen had baptized Emmie who had given typhoid to Ellen and killed her This overdressed common nasty piece of poor white trash was coming up the steps of Tara bridling and grinning as if she belonged here Scarlett thought of Ellen and in a rush feeling came back into the emptiness of her mind a murderous rage so strong it shook her like the ague Get off those steps you trashy wench she cried Get off this land Get out Emmies jaw sagged suddenly and she glanced at Jonas who came up with lowering brows He made an effort at dignity despite his anger You must not speak that way to my wife he said Wife said Scarlett and burst into a laugh that was cutting with contempt High time you made her your wife Who baptized your other brats after you killed my mother Emmie said Oh and retreated hastily down the steps but Jonas stopped her flight toward the carriage with a rough grip on her arm We came out here to pay a calla friendly call he snarled And talk a little business with old friends Friends Scarletts voice was like a whiplash When were we ever friends with the like of you The Slatterys lived on our charity and paid it back by killing Motherand youyou Pa discharged you about Emmies brat and you know it Friends Get off this place before I call Mr Benteen and Mr Wilkes Under the words Emmie broke her husbands hold and fled for the carriage scrambling in with a flash of patentleather boots with brightred tops and red tassels Now Jonas shook with a fury equal to Scarletts and his sallow face was as red as an angry turkey gobblers Still high and mighty arent you Well I know all about you I know you havent got shoes for your feet I know your fathers turned idiot Get off this place Oh you wont sing that way very long I know youre broke I know you cant even pay your taxes I came out here to offer to buy this place from youto make you a right good offer Emmie had a hankering to live here But by God I wont give you a cent now You highflying bogtrotting Irish will find out whos running things around here when you get sold out for taxes And Ill buy this place lock stock and barrelfurniture and alland Ill live in it So it was Jonas Wilkerson who wanted TaraJonas and Emmie who in some twisted way thought to even past slights by living in the home where they had been slighted All her nerves hummed with hate as they had hummed that day when she shoved the pistol barrel into the Yankees bearded face and fired She wished she had that pistol now Ill tear this house down stone by stone and burn it and sow every acre with salt before I see either of you put foot over this threshold she shouted Get out I tell you Get out Jonas glared at her started to say more and then walked toward the carriage He climbed in beside his whimpering wife and turned the horse As they drove off Scarlett had the impulse to spit at them She did spit She knew it was a common childish gesture but it made her feel better She wished she had done it while they could see her Those damned nigger lovers daring to come here and taunt her about her poverty That hound never intended offering her a price for Tara He just used that as an excuse to come and flaunt himself and Emmie in her face The dirty Scalawags the lousy trashy poor whites boasting they would live at Tara  Page    Gone With The Wind Then sudden terror struck her and her rage melted Gods nightgown They will come and live here There was nothing she could do to keep them from buying Tara nothing to keep them from levying on every mirror and table and bed on Ellens shining mahogany and rosewood and every bit of it precious to her scarred though it was by the Yankee raiders And the Robillard silver too I wont let them do it thought Scarlett vehemently No not if Ive got to burn the place down Emmie Slattery will never set her foot on a single bit of flooring Mother ever walked on She closed the door and leaned against it and she was very frightened More frightened even than she had been that day when Shermans army was in the house That day the worst she could fear was that Tara would be burned over her head But this was worsethese low common creatures living in this house bragging to their low common friends how they had turned the proud OHaras out Perhaps theyd even bring negroes here to dine and sleep Will had told her Jonas made a great todo about being equal with the negroes ate with them visited in their houses rode them around with him in his carriage put his arms around their shoulders When she thought of the possibility of this final insult to Tara her heart pounded so hard she could scarcely breathe She was trying to get her mind on her problem trying to figure some way out but each time she collected her thoughts fresh gusts of rage and fear shook her There must be some way out there must be someone somewhere who had money she could borrow Money couldnt just dry up and blow away Somebody had to have money Then the laughing words of Ashley came back to her Only one person Rhett Butler  who has money Rhett Butler She walked quickly into the parlor and shut the door behind her The dim gloom of drawn blinds and winter twilight closed about her No one would think of hunting for her here and she wanted time to think undisturbed The idea which had just occurred to her was so simple she wondered why she had not thought of it before Ill get the money from Rhett Ill sell him the diamond earbobs Or Ill borrow the money from him and let him keep the earbobs till I can pay him back For a moment relief was so great she felt weak She would pay the taxes and laugh in Jonas Wilkersons face But close on this happy thought came relentless knowledge Its not only for this year that Ill need tax money Theres next year and all the years of my life If I pay up this time theyll raise the taxes higher next time till they drive me out If I make a good cotton crop theyll tax it till Ill get nothing for it or maybe confiscate it outright and say its Confederate cotton The Yankees and the scoundrels teamed up with them have got me where they want me All my life as long as I live Ill be afraid theyll get me somehow All my life Ill be scared and scrambling for money and working myself to death only to see my work go for nothing and my cotton stolen  Just borrowing three hundred dollars for the taxes will be only a stopgap What I want is to get out of this fix for goodso I can go to sleep at night without worrying over whats going to happen to me tomorrow and next month and next year Her mind ticked on steadily Coldly and logically an idea grew in her brain She thought of Rhett a flash of white teeth against swarthy skin sardonic black eyes caressing her She recalled the hot night in Atlanta close to the end of the siege when he sat on Aunt Pittys porch half hidden in the summer darkness and she felt again the heat of his hand upon her arm as he said I want you more than I have ever wanted any womanand Ive waited longer for you than Ive ever waited for any woman Ill marry him she thought coolly And then Ill never have to bother about money again Oh blessed thought sweeter than hope of Heaven never to worry about money again to know that Tara was safe that the family was fed and clothed that she would never again have to bruise herself against stone walls She felt very old The afternoons events had drained her of all feeling first the startling news about the taxes then Ashley and last her murderous rage at Jonas Wilkerson Now there was no emotion left in her If all her capacity to feel had not been utterly exhausted something in her would have protested against the plan taking form in her mind for she hated Rhett as she hated no other person in all the world But she could not feel She could only think and her thoughts were very practical I said some terrible things to him that night when he deserted us on the road but I can make him forget them she thought contemptuously still sure of her power to charm Butter wont melt in my mouth when Im around him Ill make him think I always loved him and was just upset and frightened that night Oh men are so conceited theyll believe anything that flatters them  I must never let him dream what straits were in not till Ive got him Oh he mustnt know If he even suspected how poor we are hed know it was his money I wanted and not himself After all theres no way he could know for even Aunt Pitty doesnt know the worst And after Ive married him hell have to help us He cant let his wifes people starve His wife Mrs Rhett Butler Something of repulsion buried deep beneath her cold thinking stirred faintly and then was stilled She remembered the embarrassing and disgusting events of her brief honeymoon with Charles his fumbling hands his awkwardness his incomprehensible emotionsand Wade Hampton I wont think about it now Ill bother about it after Ive married him  After she had married him Memory rang a bell A chill went down her spine She remembered again that night on Aunt Pittys porch remembered how she asked him if he was proposing to her remembered how hatefully he had laughed and said My dear Im not a marrying man Suppose he was still not a marrying man Suppose despite all her charms and wiles he refused to marry her Supposeoh terrible thoughtsuppose he had completely forgotten about her and was chasing after some other woman I want you more than I have ever wanted any woman  Scarletts nails dug into her palms as she clenched her fists If hes forgotten me Ill make him remember me Ill make him want me again And if he would not marry her but still wanted her there was a way to get the money After all he had once asked her to be his mistress In the dim grayness of the parlor she fought a quick decisive battle with the three most binding ties of her soulthe memory of Ellen the teachings of her religion and her love for Ashley She knew that what she had in her mind must be hideous to her mother even in that warm faroff Heaven where she surely was She knew that fornication was a mortal sin And she knew that loving Ashley as she did her plan was doubly prostitution  Page    Gone With The Wind But all these things went down before the merciless coldness of her mind and the goad of desperation Ellen was dead and perhaps death gave an understanding of all things Religion forbade fornication on pain of hell fire but if the Church thought she was going to leave one stone unturned in saving Tara and saving the family from starvingwell let the Church bother about that She wouldnt At least not now And AshleyAshley didnt want her Yes he did want her The memory of his warm mouth on hers told her that But he would never take her away with him Strange that going away with Ashley did not seem like a sin but with Rhett In the dull twilight of the winter afternoon she came to the end of the long road which had begun the night Atlanta fell She had set her feet upon that road a spoiled selfish and untried girl full of youth warm of emotion easily bewildered by life Now at the end of the road there was nothing left of that girl Hunger and hard labor fear and constant strain the terrors of war and the terrors of Reconstruction had taken away all warmth and youth and softness About the core of her being a shell of hardness had formed and little by little layer by layer the shell had thickened during the endless months But until this very day two hopes had been left to sustain her She had hoped that the war being over life would gradually resume its old face She had hoped that Ashleys return would bring back some meaning into life Now both hopes were gone The sight of Jonas Wilkerson in the front walk of Tara had made her realize that for her for the whole South the war would never end The bitterest fighting the most brutal retaliations were just beginning And Ashley was imprisoned forever by words which were stronger than any jail Peace had failed her and Ashley had failed her both in the same day and it was as if the last crevice in the shell had been sealed the final layer hardened She had become what Grandma Fontaine had counseled against a woman who had seen the worst and so had nothing else to fear Not life nor Mother nor loss of love nor public opinion Only hunger and her nightmare dream of hunger could make her afraid A curious sense of lightness of freedom pervaded her now that she had finally hardened her heart against all that bound her to the old days and the old Scarlett She had made her decision and thank God she wasnt afraid She had nothing to lose and her mind was made up If she could only coax Rhett into marrying her all would be perfect But if she couldntwell shed get the money just the same For a brief moment she wondered with impersonal curiosity what would be expected of a mistress Would Rhett insist on keeping her in Atlanta as people said he kept the Watling woman If he made her stay in Atlanta hed have to pay wellpay enough to balance what her absence from Tara would be worth Scarlett was very ignorant of the hidden side of mens lives and had no way of knowing just what the arrangement might involve And she wondered if she would have a baby That would be distinctly terrible I wont think of that now Ill think of it later and she pushed the unwelcome idea into the back of her mind lest it shake her resolution Shed tell the family tonight she was going to Atlanta to borrow money to try to mortgage the farm if necessary That would be all they needed to know until such an evil day when they might find out differently With the thought of action her head went up and her shoulders went back This affair was not going to be easy she knew Formerly it had been Rhett who asked for her favors and she who held the power Now she was the beggar and a beggar in no position to dictate terms But I wont go to him like a beggar Ill go like a queen granting favors Hell never know She walked to the long pier glass and looked at herself her head held high And she saw framed in the cracking gilt molding a stranger It was as if she were really seeing herself for the first time in a year She had glanced in the mirror every morning to see that her face was clean and her hair tidy but she had always been too pressed by other things to really see herself But this stranger Surely this thin hollowcheeked woman couldnt be Scarlett OHara Scarlett OHara had a pretty coquettish highspirited face This face at which she stared was not pretty at all and had none of the charm she remembered so well It was white and strained and the black brows above slanting green eyes swooped up startlingly against the white skin like frightened birds wings There was a hard and hunted look about this face Im not pretty enough to get him she thought and desperation came back to her Im thinoh Im terribly thin She patted her cheeks felt frantically at her collar bones feeling them stand out through her basque And her breasts were so small almost as small as Melanies Shed have to put ruffles in her bosom to make them look larger and she had always had contempt for girls who resorted to such subterfuges Ruffles That brought up another thought Her clothes She looked down at her dress spreading its mended folds wide between her hands Rhett liked women who were well dressed fashionably dressed She remembered with longing the flounced green dress she had worn when she first came out of mourning the dress she wore with the green plumed bonnet he had brought her and she recalled the approving compliments he had paid her She remembered too with hate sharpened by envy the red plaid dress the redtopped boots with tassels and the pancake hat of Emmie Slattery They were gaudy but they were new and fashionable and certainly they caught the eye And oh how she wanted to catch the eye Especially the eye of Rhett Butler If he should see her in her old clothes hed know everything was wrong at Tara And he must not know What a fool she had been to think she could go to Atlanta and have him for the asking she with her scrawny neck and hungry cat eyes and raggedy dress If she hadnt been able to pry a proposal from him at the height of her beauty when she had her prettiest clothes how could she expect to get one now when she was ugly and dressed tackily If Miss Pittys story was true he must have more money than anyone in Atlanta and probably had his pick of all the pretty ladies good and bad Well she thought grimly Ive got something that most pretty ladies havent gotand thats a mind thats made up And if I had just one nice dress There wasnt a nice dress in Tara or a dress which hadnt been turned twice and mended Thats that she thought disconsolately looking down at the floor She saw Ellens mossgreen velvet carpet now worn and scuffed and torn and spotted from the numberless men who had slept upon it and the sight depressed her more for it made her realize that Tara was just as ragged as she The whole darkening room depressed her and going to the window she raised the sash unlatched the shutters and let the last light of the wintry sunset into the room She closed the window and leaned her head against  Page    Gone With The Wind the velvet curtains and looked out across the bleak pasture toward the dark cedars of the burying ground The mossgreen velvet curtains felt prickly and soft beneath her cheek and she rubbed her face against them gratefully like a cat And then suddenly she looked at them A minute later she was dragging a heavy marbletopped table across the floor Its rusty castors screeching in protest She rolled the table under the window gathered up her skirts climbed on it and tiptoed to reach the heavy curtain pole It was almost out of her reach and she jerked at it so impatiently the nails came out of the wood and the curtains pole and all fell to the floor with a clatter As if by magic the door of the parlor opened and the wide black face of Mammy appeared ardent curiosity and deepest suspicion evident in every wrinkle She looked disapprovingly at Scarlett poised on the table top her skirts above her knees ready to leap to the floor There was a look of excitement and triumph on her face which brought sudden distrust to Mammy Whut you up to wid Miss Ellens poteers she demanded What are you up to listening outside doors asked Scarlett leaping nimbly to the floor and gathering up a length of the heavy dusty velvet Dat ain needer hyah no dar countered Mammy girding herself for combat You ain got no bizness wid Miss Ellens poteers juckin de poles plum outer de wood an drappin dem on de flo in de dust Miss Ellen set gret sto by dem poteers an Ah ain tendin ter have you muss dem up dat way Scarlett turned green eyes on Mammy eyes which were feverishly gay eyes which looked like the bad little girl of the good old days Mammy sighed about Scoot up to the attic and get my box of dress patterns Mammy she cried giving her a slight shove Im going to have a new dress Mammy was torn between indignation at the very idea of her two hundred pounds scooting anywhere much less to the attic and the dawning of a horrid suspicion Quickly she snatched the curtain lengths from Scarlett holding them against her monumental sagging breasts as if they were holy relics Not outer Miss Ellens poteers is you gwine have a new dress ef dats whut you figgerin on Not wile Ah got breaf in mah body For a moment the expression Mammy was wont to describe to herself as bullheaded flitted over her young mistress face and then it passed into a smile so difficult for Mammy to resist But it did not fool the old woman She knew Miss Scarlett was employing that smile merely to get around her and in this matter she was determined not to be gotten around Mammy dont be mean Im going to Atlanta to borrow some money and Ive got to have a new dress You doan need no new dress Ain no other ladies got new dresses Dey weahs dey ole ones an dey weahs dem proudfully Ain no reason why Miss Ellens chile kain weah rags ef she wants ter an eveybody respec her lak she wo silk The bullheaded expression began to creep back Lordy twus right funny how de older Miss Scarlett git de mo she look lak Mist Gerald and de less lak Miss Ellen Now Mammy you know Aunt Pitty wrote us that Miss Fanny Elsing is getting married this Saturday and of course Ill go to the wedding And Ill need a new dress to wear De dress you got onll be jes as nice as Miss Fannys weddin dress Miss Pitty done wrote dat de Elsings

Will doan never tek trouble ter close de do Was there nothing Mammy did not overhear Scarlett wondered how that ponderous body which shook the floors could move with such savage stealth when its owner wished to eavesdrop Well if you heard all that I suppose you heard Jonas Wilkerson and that Emmie Yasm said Mammy with smoldering eyes Well dont be a mule Mammy Dont you see Ive got to go to Atlanta and get money for the taxes Ive got to get some money Ive got to do it She hammered one small fist into the other Name of God Mammy theyll turn us all out into the road and then wherell we go Are you going to argue with me about a little matter of Mothers curtains when that trash Emmie Slattery who killed Mother is fixing to move into this house and sleep in the bed Mother slept in Mammy shifted from one foot to another like a restive elephant She had a dim feeling that she was being got around Nom Ah ain wantin ter see trash in Miss Ellens house or us all in de road but She fixed Scarlett with a suddenly accusing eye Who is you fixin ter git money frum dat you needs a new dress That said Scarlett taken aback is my own business Mammy looked at her piercingly just as she had done when Scarlett was small and had tried unsuccessfully to palm off plausible excuses for misdeeds She seemed to be reading her mind and Scarlett dropped her eyes unwillingly the first feeling of guilt at her intended conduct creeping over her So you needs a spang new pretty dress ter borry money wid Dat doan lissen jes right ter me An you ain sayin whar de money ter come frum Im not saying anything said Scarlett indignantly Its my own business Are you going to give me that curtain and help me make the dress Yasm said Mammy softly capitulating with a suddenness which aroused all the suspicion in Scarletts mind Ah gwine hep you mek it an Ah specs we mout git a petticoat outer de satin linin of de poteers an trim a par pantalets wid de lace cuttins She handed the velvet curtain back to Scarlett and a sly smile spread over her face Miss Melly gwine ter Lanta wid you Miss Scarlett No said Scarlett sharply beginning to realize what was coming Im going by myself  Page    Gone With The Wind Dats whut you thinks said Mammy firmly but Ah is gwine wid you an dat new dress Yas Mam evey step of de way For an instant Scarlett envisaged her trip to Atlanta and her conversation with Rhett with Mammy glowering chaperonage like a large black Cerberus in the background She smiled again and put a hand on Mammys arm Mammy darling youre sweet to want to go with me and help me but how on earth would the folks here get on without you You know you just about run Tara Huh said Mammy Doan do no good ter sweet talk me Miss Scarlett Ah been knowin you sence Ah put de fust par of diapers on you Ahs said Ahs

Scarlett offered frantically Miss Pittypat a fine woman an she think she see eveything but she doan said Mammy and turning with the majestic air of having closed the interview she went into the hall The boards trembled as she called Prissy child Fly up de stairs an fotch Miss Scarletts pattun box frum de attic an try an fine de scissors without takin all night bout it This is a fine mess thought Scarlett dejectedly Id as soon have a bloodhound after me After supper had been cleared away Scarlett and Mammy spread patterns on the diningroom table while Suellen and Carreen busily ripped satin linings from curtains and Melanie brushed the velvet with a clean hairbrush to remove the dust Gerald Will and Ashley sat about the room smoking smiling at the feminine tumult A feeling of pleasurable excitement which seemed to emanate from Scarlett was on them all an excitement they could not understand There was color in Scarletts face and a bright hard glitter in her eyes and she laughed a good deal Her laughter pleased them all for it had been months since they had heard her really laugh Especially did it please Gerald His eyes were less vague thanusual as they followed her swishing figure about the room and he patted her approvingly whenever she was within reach The girls were as excited as if preparing for a ball and they ripped and cut and basted as if making a ball dress of their own Scarlett was going to Atlanta to borrow money or to mortgage Tara if necessary But what was a mortgage after all Scarlett said they could easily pay it off out of next years cotton and have money left over and she said it with such finality they did not think to question And when they asked who was going to lend the money she said Layovers catch meddlers so archly they all laughed and teased her about her millionaire friend It must be Captain Rhett Butler said Melanie slyly and they exploded with mirth at this absurdity knowing how Scarlett hated him and never failed to refer to him as that skunk Rhett Butler But Scarlett did not laugh at this and Ashley who had laughed stopped abruptly as he saw Mammy shoot a quick guarded glance at Scarlett Suellen moved to generosity by the party spirit of the occasion produced her Irishlace collar somewhat worn but still pretty and Carreen insisted that Scarlett wear her slippers to Atlanta for they were in better condition than any others at Tara Melanie begged Mammy to leave her enough velvet scraps to recover the frame of her battered bonnet and brought shouts of laughter when she said the old rooster was going to part with his gorgeous bronze and greenblack tail feathers unless he took to the swamp immediately Scarlett watching the flying fingers heard the laughter and looked at them all with concealed bitterness and contempt They havent an idea what is really happening to me or to themselves or to the South They still think in spite of everything that nothing really dreadful can happen to any of them because they are who they are OHaras Wilkeses Hamiltons Even the darkies feel that way Oh theyre all fools Theyll never realize Theyll go right on thinking and living as they always have and nothing will change them Melly can dress in rags and pick cotton and even help me murder a man but it doesnt change her Shes still the shy wellbred Mrs Wilkes the perfect lady And Ashley can see death and war and be wounded and lie in jail and come home to less than nothing and still be the same gentleman he was when he had all Twelve Oaks behind him Will is different He knows how things really are but then Will never had anything much to lose And as for Suellen and Carreenthey think all this is just a temporary matter They dont change to meet changed conditions because they think itll all be over soon They think God is going to work a miracle especially for their benefit But He wont The only miracle thats going to be worked around here is the one Im going to work on Rhett Butler  They wont change Maybe they cant change Im the only one whos changedand I wouldnt have changed if I could have helped it Mammy finally turned the men out of the dining room and closed the door so the fitting could begin Pork helped Gerald upstairs to bed and Ashley and Will were left alone in the lamplight in the front hall They were silent for a while and Will chewed his tobacco like a placid ruminant animal But his mild face was far from placid This goin to Atlanta he said at last in a slow voice I dont like it Not one bit Ashley looked at Will quickly and then looked away saying nothing but wondering if Will had the same awful suspicion which was haunting him But that was impossible Will didnt know what had taken place in the orchard that afternoon and how it had driven Scarlett to desperation Will couldnt have noticed Mammys face when Rhett Butlers name was mentioned and besides Will didnt know about Rhetts money or his foul reputation At least Ashley did not think he could know these things but since coming back to Tara he had realized that Will like Mammy seemed to know things without being told to sense them before they happened There was something ominous in the air exactly what Ashley did nut know but he was powerless to save Scarlett from it She had not met his eyes once that evening and the hard bright gaiety with which she had treated him was frightening The suspicions which tore at him were too terrible to be put into words He did not have the right to insult her by asking her if they were true He clenched his fists He had no rights at all where she was concerned this afternoon he had forfeited them all forever He could not help her No one could help her But when he thought of Mammy and the look of grim determination she wore as she cut into the velvet curtains he was cheered a little Mammy would take care of Scarlett whether Scarlett wished it or not I have caused all this he thought despairingly I have driven her to this  Page    Gone With The Wind He remembered the way she had squared her shoulders when she turned away from him that afternoon remembered the stubborn lift of her head His heart went out to her torn with his own helplessness wrenched with admiration He knew she had no such word in her vocabulary as gallantry knew she would have stared blankly if he had told her she was the most gallant soul he had ever known He knew she would not understand how many truly fine things he ascribed to her when he thought of her as gallant He knew that she took life as it came opposed her toughfibered mind to whatever obstacles there might be fought on with a determination that would not recognize defeat and kept on fighting even when she saw defeat was inevitable But for four years he had seen others who had refused to recognize defeat men who rode gaily into sure disaster because they were gallant And they had been defeated just the same He thought as he stared at Will in the shadowy hall that he had never known such gallantry as the gallantry of Scarlett OHara going forth to conquer the world in her mothers velvet curtains and the tail feathers of a rooster CHAPTER XXXIII A COLD WIND was blowing stiffly and the scudding clouds overhead were the deep gray of slate when Scarlett and Mammy stepped from the train in Atlanta the next afternoon The depot had not been rebuilt since the burning of the city and they alighted amid cinders and mud a few yards above the blackened ruins which marked the site Habit strong upon her Scarlett looked about for Uncle Peter and Pittys carriage for she had always been met by them when returning from Tara to Atlanta during the war years Then she caught herself with a sniff at her own absentmindedness Naturally Peter wasnt there for she had given Aunt Pitty no warning of her coming and moreover she remembered that one of the old ladys letters had dealt tearfully with the death of the old nag Peter had  quired in Macon to bring her back to Atlanta after the surrender She looked about the rutted and cutup space around the depot for the equipage of some old friend or acquaintance who might drive them to Aunt Pittys house but she recognized no one black or white Probably none of her old friends owned carriages now if what Pitty had written them was true Times were so hard it was difficult to feed and lodge humans much less animals Most of Pittys friends like herself were afoot these days There were a few wagons loading at the freight cars and several mudsplashed buggies with roughlooking strangers at the reins but only two carriages One was a closed carriage the other open and occupied by a welldressed woman and a Yankee officer Scarlett drew in her breath sharply at the sight of the uniform Although Pitty had written that Atlanta was garrisoned and the streets full of soldiers the first sight of the bluecoat startled and frightened her It was hard to remember that the war was over and that this man would not pursue her rob her and insult her The comparative emptiness around the train took her mind back to that morning in  when she had come to Atlanta as a young widow swathed in crpe and wild with boredom She recalled how crowded this space had been with wagons and carriages and ambulances and how noisy with drivers swearing and yelling and people calling greetings to friends She sighed for the lighthearted excitement of the war days and sighed again at the thought of walking all the way to Aunt Pittys house But she was hopeful that once on Peachtree Street she might meet someone she knew who would give them a ride As she stood looking about her a saddlecolored negro of middle age drove the dosed carriage toward her and leaning from the box questioned Cahige lady Two bits fer any whar in Lanta Mammy threw him an annihilating glance A hired hack she rumbled Nigger does you know who we is Mammy was a country negro but she had not always been a country negro and she knew that no chaste woman ever rode in a hired conveyanceespecially a closed carriagewithout the escort of some male member of her family Even the presence of a negro maid would not satisfy the conventions She gave Scarlett a glare as she saw her look longingly at the hack Come way frum dar Miss Scarlett A hired hack an a free issue nigger Well dats a good combination Ah ain no free issue nigger declared the driver with heat Ah blongs ter Ole Miss Talbot an disyere her cahige an Ah drives it ter mek money fer us Whut Miss Talbot is dat Miss Suzannah Talbot of Milledgeville Us done move up hyah affer Old Marse wuz kilt Does you know her Miss Scarlett No said Scarlett regretfully I know so few Milledgeville folks Den usll walk said Mammy sternly Drive on nigger She picked up the carpetbag which held Scarletts new velvet frock and bonnet and nightgown and tucked the neat bandanna bundle that contained her own belongings under her arm and shepherded Scarlett across the wet expanse of cinders Scarlett did not argue the matter much as she preferred to ride for she wished no disagreement with Mammy Ever since yesterday afternoon when Mammy had caught her with the velvet curtains there had been an alert suspicious look in her eyes which Scarlett did not like It was going to be difficult to escape from her chaperonage and she did not intend to rouse Mammys fighting blood before it was absolutely necessary As they walked along the narrow sidewalk toward Peachtree Scarlett was dismayed and sorrowful for Atlanta looked so devastated and different from what she remembered They passed beside what had been the Atlanta Hotel where Rhett and Uncle Henry had lived and of that elegant hostelry there remained only a shell a part of the blackened walls The warehouses which had bordered the train tracks for a quarter of a mile and held tons of military supplies had not been rebuilt and their rectangular foundations looked dreary under the dark sky Without the wall of buildings on either side and with the car shed gone the railroad tracks seemed bare and exposed Somewhere amid these ruins undistinguishable from the others lay what remained of her own warehouse on the property Charles had left her Uncle Henry had paid last years taxes on it for her Shed have to repay that money some time That was something else to worry about As they turned the corner into Peachtree Street and she looked toward Five Points she cried out with shock Despite all Frank had told her about the town burning to the ground she had never really visualized complete destruction In her mind the town she  Page    Gone With The Wind loved so well still stood full of closepacked buildings and fine houses But this Peachtree Street she was looking upon was so denuded of landmarks it was as unfamiliar as if she had never seen it before This muddy street down which she had driven a thousand times during the war along which she had fled with ducked head and fearquickened legs when shells burst over her during the siege this street she had last seen in the heat and hurry and anguish of the day of the retreat was so strange looking she felt like crying Though many new buildings had sprung up in the year since Sherman marched out of the burning town and the Confederates returned there were still wide vacant lots around Five Points where heaps of smudged broken bricks lay amid a jumble of rubbish dead weeds and broomsedge There were the remains of a few buildings she remembered roofless brick walls through which the dull daylight shone glassless windows gaping chimneys towering lonesomely Here and there her eyes gladly picked out a familiar store which had partly survived shell and fire and had been repaired the fresh red of new brick glaring bright against the smut of the old walls On new store fronts and new office windows she saw the welcome names of men she knew but more often the names were unfamiliar especially the dozens of shingles of strange doctors and lawyers and cotton merchants Once she had known practically everyone in Atlanta and the sight of so many strange names depressed her But she was cheered by the sight of new buildings going up all along the street There were dozens of them and several were three stories high Everywhere building was going on for as she looked down the street trying to adjust her mind to the new Atlanta she heard the blithe sound of hammers and saws noticed scaffoldings rising and saw men climbing ladders with hods of bricks on their shoulders She looked down the street she loved so well and her eyes misted a little They burned you she thought and they laid you flat But they didnt lick you They couldnt lick you Youll grow back just as big and sassy as you used to be As she walked along Peachtree followed by the waddling Mammy she found the sidewalks just as crowded as they were at the height of the war and there was the same air of rush and bustle about the resurrecting town which had made her blood sing when she came here so long ago on her first visit to Aunt Pitty There seemed to be just as many vehicles wallowing in the mud holes as there had been then except that there were no Confederate ambulances and just as many horses and mules tethered to hitching racks in front of the wooden awnings of the stores Though the sidewalks were jammed the faces she saw were as unfamiliar as the signs overhead new people many roughlooking men and tawdrily dressed women The streets were black with loafing negroes who leaned against walls or sat on the curbing watching vehicles go past with the nave curiosity of children at a circus parade Free issue country niggers snorted Mammy Ain never seed a proper cahige in dere lives An impident lookin too They were impudent looking Scarlett agreed for they stared at her in an insolent manner but she forgot them in the renewed shock of seeing blue uniforms The town was full of Yankee soldiers on horses afoot in army wagons loafing on the street reeling out of barrooms Ill never get used to them she thought clenching her fists Never and over her shoulder Hurry Mammy lets get out of this crowd Soons Ah kick dis black trash outer mah way answered Mammy loudly swinging the carpetbag at a black buck who loitered tantalizingly in front of her and making him leap aside Ah doan lak disyere town Miss Scarlett Its too full of Yankees an cheap free issue Its nicer where it isnt so crowded When we get across Five Points it wont be so bad They picked their way across the slippery stepping stones that bridged the mud of Decatur Street and continued up Peachtree through a thinning crowd When they reached Wesley Chapel where Scarlett had paused to catch her breath that day in  when she had run for Dr Meade she looked at it and laughed aloud shortly and grimly Mammys quick old eyes sought hers with suspicion and question but her curiosity went unsatisfied Scarlett was recalling with contempt the terror which had ridden her that day She had been crawling with fear rotten with fear terrified by the Yankees terrified by the approaching birth of Beau Now she wondered how she could have been so frightened frightened like a child at a loud noise And what a child she had been to think that Yankees and fire and defeat were the worst things that could happen to her What trivialities they were beside Ellens death and Geralds vagueness beside hunger and cold and backbreaking work and the living nightmare of insecurity How easy she would find it now to be brave before an invading army but how hard to face the danger that threatened Tara No she would never again be afraid of anything except poverty Up Peachtree came a closed carriage and Scarlett went to the curb eagerly to see if she knew the occupant for Aunt Pittys house was still several blocks away She and Mammy leaned forward as the carriage came abreast and Scarlett with a smile arranged almost called out when a womans head appeared for a moment at the windowa too bright red head beneath a fine fur hat Scarlett took a step back as mutual recognition leaped into both faces It was Belle Watling and Scarlett had a glimpse of nostrils distended with dislike before she disappeared again Strange that Belles should be the first familiar face she saw Who dat questioned Mammy suspiciously She knowed you but she din bow Ah ain never seed har dat color in mah life Not even in de Tarleton fambly It lookwell it look dyed ter me It is said Scarlett shortly walking faster Does you know a dyedhard woman Ah ast you who she is Shes the town bad woman said Scarlett briefly and I give you my word I dont know her so shut up Gawdlmighty breathed Mammy her jaw dropping as she looked after the carriage with passionate curiosity She had not seen a professional bad woman since she left Savannah with Ellen more than twenty years before and she wished ardently that she had observed Belle more closely She sho dressed up fine an got a fine cahige an coachman she muttered Ah doan know whut de Lawd thinkin bout lettin de bad women flurrish lak dat wen us good folks is hongry an mos barefoot The Lord stopped thinking about us years ago said Scarlett savagely And dont go telling me Mother is turning in her grave to hear me say it either  Page    Gone With The Wind She wanted to feel superior and virtuous about Belle but she could not If her plans went well she might be on the same footing with Belle and supported by the same man While she did not regret her decision one whit the matter in its true light discomfited her I wont think of it now she told herself and hurried her steps They passed the lot where the Meade house had stood and there remained of it only a forlorn pair of stone steps and a walk leading up to nothing Where the Whitings home had been was bare ground Even the foundation stones and the brick chimneys were gone and there were wagon tracks where they had been carted away The brick house of the Elsings still stood with a new roof and a new second floor The Bonnell home awkwardly patched and roofed with rude boards instead of shingles managed to look livable for all its battered appearance But in neither house was there a face at the window or a figure on the porch and Scarlett was glad She did not want to talk to anyone now Then the new slate roof of Aunt Pittys house came in view with its redbrick walls and Scarletts heart throbbed How good of the Lord not to level it beyond repair Coming out of the front yard was Uncle Peter a market basket on his arm and when he saw Scarlett and Mammy trudging along a wide incredulous smile split his black face I could kiss the old black fool Im so glad to see him thought Scarlett joyfully and she called Run get Aunties swoon bottle Peter Its really me That night the inevitable hominy and dried peas were on Aunt Pittys supper table and as Scarlett ate them she made a vow that these two dishes would never appear on her table when she had money again And no matter what price she had to pay she was going to have money again more than just enough to pay the taxes on Tara Somehow some day she was going to have plenty of money if she had to commit murder to get it In the yellow lamplight of the dining room she asked Pitty about her finances hoping against hope that Charles family might be able to lend her the money she needed The questions were none too subtle but Pitty in her pleasure at having a member of the family to talk to did not even notice the bald way the questions were put She plunged with tears into the details of her misfortunes She just didnt know where her farms and town property and money had gone but everything had slipped away At least that was what Brother Henry told her He hadnt been able to pay the taxes on her estate Everything except the house she was living in was gone and Pitty did not stop to think that the house had never been hers but was the joint property of Melanie and Scarlett Brother Henry could just barely pay taxes on this house He gave her a little something every month to live on and though it was very humiliating to take money from him she had to do it Brother Henry says he doesnt know how hell make ends meet with the load hes carrying and the taxes so high but of course hes probably lying and has loads of money and just wont give me much Scarlett knew Uncle Henry wasnt lying The few letters she had had from him in connection with Charles property showed that The old lawyer was battling valiantly to save the house and the one piece of downtown property where the warehouse had been so Wade and Scarlett would have something left from the wreckage Scarlett knew he was carrying these taxes for her at a great sacrifice Of course he hasnt any money thought Scarlett grimly Well check him and Aunt Pitty off my list Theres nobody left but Rhett Ill have to do it I must do it But I mustnt think about it now  I must get her to talking about Rhett so I can casually suggest to her to invite him to call tomorrow She smiled and squeezed the plump palms of Aunt Pitty between her own Darling Auntie she said dont lets talk about distressing things like money any more Lets forget about them and talk of pleasanter things You must tell me all the news about our old friends How is Mrs Merriwether and Maybelle I heard that Maybelles little Creole came home safely How are the Elsings and Dr and Mrs Meade Pittypat brightened at the change of subject and her baby face stopped quivering with tears She gave detailed reports about old neighbors what they were doing and wearing and eating and thinking She told with accents of horror how before Ren Picard came home from the war Mrs Merriwether and Maybelle had made ends meet by baking pies and selling them to the Yankee soldiers Imagine that Sometimes there were two dozen Yankees standing in the back yard of the Merriwether home waiting for the baking to be finished Now that Ren was home he drove an old wagon to the Yankee camp every day and sold cakes and pies and beaten biscuits to the soldiers Mrs Merriwether said that when she made a little more money she was going to open a bake shop downtown Pitty did not wish to criticize but after all As for herself said Pitty she would rather starve than have such commerce with Yankees She made a point of giving a disdainful look to every soldier she met and crossed to the other side of the street in as insulting a manner as possible though she said this was quite inconvenient in wet weather Scarlett gathered that no sacrifice even though it be muddy shoes was too great to show loyalty to the Confederacy in so far as Miss Pittypat was concerned Mrs Meade and the doctor had lost their home when the Yankees fired the town and they had neither the money nor the heart to rebuild now that Phil and Darcy were dead Mrs Meade said she never wanted a home again for what was a home without children and grandchildren in it They were very lonely and had gone to live with the Elsings who had rebuilt the damaged part of their home Mr and Mrs Whiting had a room there too and Mrs Bonnell was talking of moving in if she was fortunate enough to rent her house to a Yankee officer and his family But how do they all squeeze in cried Scarlett Theres Mrs Elsing and Fanny and Hugh Mrs Elsing and Fanny sleep in the parlor and Hugh in the attic explained Pitty who knew the domestic arrangements of all her friends My dear I do hate to tell you this butMrs Elsing calls them paying guests but Pitty dropped her voice they are really nothing at all except boarders Mrs Elsing is running a boarding house Isnt that dreadful I think its wonderful said Scarlett shortly I only wish wed had paying guests at Tara for the last year instead of free boarders Maybe we wouldnt be so poor now Scarlett how can you say such things Your poor mother must be turning in her grave at the very thought of charging money for the hospitality of Tara Of course Mrs Elsing was simply forced to it because while she took in fine sewing and Fanny painted china and Hugh made a little money peddling firewood they couldnt make ends meet Imagine darling Hugh forced to  Page    Gone With The Wind peddle wood And he all set to be a fine lawyer I could just cry at the things our boys are reduced to Scarlett thought of the rows of cotton beneath the glaring coppery sky at Tara and how her back had ached as she bent over them She remembered the feel of plow handles between her inexperienced blistered palms and she felt that Hugh Elsing was deserving of no special sympathy What an innocent old fool Pitty was and despite the ruin all around her how sheltered If he doesnt like peddling why doesnt He practice law Or isnt there any law practice left in Atlanta Oh dear yes Theres plenty of law practice Practically everybody is suing everybody else these days With everything burned down and boundary lines wiped out no one knows just where their land begins or ends But you cant get any pay for suing because nobody has any money So Hugh sticks to his peddling  Oh I almost forgot Did I write you Fanny Elsing is getting married tomorrow night and of course you must attend Mrs Elsing will be only too pleased to have you when she knows youre in town I do hope you have some other frock besides that one Not that it isnt a very sweet frock darling butwell it does look a bit worn Oh you have a pretty frock Im so glad because its going to be the first real wedding weve had in Atlanta since before the town fell Cake and wine and dancing afterward though I dont know how the Elsings can afford it they are so poor Who is Fanny marrying I thought after Dallas McLure was killed at Gettysburg Darling you mustnt criticize Fanny Everybody isnt as loyal to the dead as you are to poor Charlie Let me see What is his name I can never remember namesTom somebody I knew his mother well we went to LaGrange Female Institute together She was a Tomlinson from LaGrange and her mother waslet me see  Perkins Parkins Parkinson Thats it From Sparta A very good family but just the samewell I know I shouldnt say it but I dont see how Fanny can bring herself to marry him Does he drink or Dear no His character is perfect but you see he was wounded low down by a bursting shell and it did something to his legsmakes themmakes them well I hate to use the word but it makes him spraddle It gives him a very vulgar appearance when he walkswell it doesnt look very pretty I dont see why shes marrying him Girls have to marry someone Indeed they do not said Pitty ruffling I never had to Now darling I didnt mean you Everybody knows how popular you were and still are Why old Judge Carlton used to throw sheeps eyes at you till I Oh Scarlett hush That old fool giggled Pitty good humor restored But after all Fanny was so popular she could have made a better match and I dont believe she loves this Tom whatshisname I dont believe shes ever gotten over Dallas McLure getting killed but shes not like you darling Youve remained so faithful to dear Charlie though you could have married dozens of times Melly and I have often said how loyal you were to his memory when everyone else said you were just a heartless coquette Scarlett passed over this tactless confidence and skillfully led Pitty from one friend to another but all the while she was in a fever of impatience to bring the conversation around to Rhett It would never do for her to ask outright about him so soon after arriving It might start the old ladys mind to working on channels better left untouched There would be time enough for Pittys suspicions to be aroused if Rhett refused to marry her Aunt Pitty prattled on happily pleased as a child at having an audience Things in Atlanta were in a dreadful pass she said due to the vile doings of the Republicans There was no end to their goings on and the worst thing was the way they were putting ideas in the poor darkies heads My dear they want to let the darkies vote Did you ever hear of anything more silly ThoughI dont knownow that I think about it Uncle Peter has much more sense than any Republican I ever saw and much better manners but of course Uncle Peter is far too well bred to want to vote But the very notion has upset the darkies till theyre right addled And some of them are so insolent Your life isnt safe on the streets after dark and even in the broad daylight they push ladies off the sidewalks into the mud And if any gentleman dares to protest they arrest him and My dear did I tell you that Captain Butler was in jail Rhett Butler Even with this startling news Scarlett was grateful that Aunt Pitty had saved her the necessity of bringing his name into the conversation herself Yes indeed Excitement colored Pittys cheeks pink and she sat upright Hes in jail this very minute for killing a negro and they may hang him Imagine Captain Butler hanging For a moment the breath went out of Scarletts lungs in a sickening gasp and she could only stare at the fat old lady who was so obviously pleased at the effect of her statement They havent proved it yet but somebody killed this darky who had insulted a white woman And the Yankees are very upset because so many uppity darkies have been killed recently They cant prove it on Captain Butler but they want to make an example of someone so Dr Meade says The doctor says that if they do hang him it will be the first good honest job the Yankees ever did but then I dont know  And to think that Captain Butler was here just a week ago and brought me the loveliest quail you ever saw for a present and he was asking about you and saying he feared he had offended you during the siege and you would never forgive him How long will he be in jail Nobody knows Perhaps till they hang him but maybe they wont be able to prove the killing on him after all However it doesnt seem to bother the Yankees whether folks are guilty or not so long as they can hang somebody They are so upsetPitty dropped her voice mysteriouslyabout the Ku Klux Klan Do you have the Klan down in the County My dear Im sure you must and Ashley just doesnt tell you girls anything about it Klansmen arent supposed to tell They ride around at night dressed up like ghosts and call on Carpetbaggers who steal money and negroes who are uppity Sometimes they just scare them and warn them to leave Atlanta but when they dont behave they whip them and Pitty whispered sometimes they kill them and leave them where theyll be easily found with the Ku Klux card on them  And the Yankees are very angry about it and want to make an example of someone  But Hugh Elsing told me he didnt think theyd hang Captain Butler because the  Page    Gone With The Wind Yankees think he does know where the money is and just wont tell They are trying to make him tell The money Didnt you know Didnt I write you My dear you have been buried at Tara havent you The town simply buzzed when Captain Butler came back here with a fine horse and carriage and his pockets full of money when all the rest of us didnt know where our next meal was coming from It simply made everybody furious that an old speculator who always said nasty things about the Confederacy should have so much money when we were all so poor Everybody was bursting to know how he managed to save his money but no one had the courage to ask himexcept me and he just laughed and said In no honest way you may be sure You know how hard it is to get anything sensible out of him But of course he made his money out of the blockade Of course he did honey some of it But thats not a drop in the bucket to what that man has really got Everybody including the Yankees believes hes got millions of dollars in gold belonging to the Confederate government hid out somewhere Millionsin gold Well honey where did all our Confederate gold go to Somebody got it and Captain Butler must be one of the somebodies The Yankees thought President Davis had it when he left Richmond but when they captured the poor man he had hardly a cent There just wasnt any money in the treasury when the war was over and everybody thinks some of the blockade runners got it and are keeping quiet about it Millionsin gold But how Didnt Captain Butler take thousands of bales of cotton to England and Nassau to sell for the Confederate government asked Pitty triumphantly Not only his own cotton but government cotton too And you know what cotton brought in England during the war Any price you wanted to ask He was a free agent acting for the government and he was supposed to sell the cotton and buy guns with the money and run the guns in for us Well when the blockade got too tight he couldnt bring in the guns and he couldnt have spent one onehundredth of the cotton money on them anyway so there were simply millions of dollars in English banks put there by Captain Butler and other blockaders waiting till the blockade loosened And you cant tell me they banked that money in the name of the Confederacy They put it in their own names and its still there  Everybody has been talking about it ever since the surrender and criticizing the blockaders severely and when the Yankees arrested Captain Butler for killing this darky they must have heard the rumor because theyve been at him to tell them where the money is You see all of our Confederate funds belong to the Yankees nowat least the Yankees think so But Captain Butler says he doesnt know anything  Dr Meade says they ought to hang him anyhow only hanging is too good for a thief and a profiteer Dear you look so oddly Do you feel faint Have I upset you talking like this I knew he was once a beau of yours but I thought youd fallen out long ago Personally I never approved of him for hes such a scamp Hes no friend of mine said Scarlett with an effort I had a quarrel with him during the siege after you went to Macon Wherewhere is he In the firehouse over near the public square In the firehouse Aunt Pitty crowed with laughter Yes hes in the firehouse The Yankees use it for a military jail now The Yankees are camped in huts all round the city hall in the square and the firehouse is just down the street so thats where Captain Butler is And Scarlett I heard the funniest thing yesterday about Captain Butler I forget who told me You know how well groomed he always wasreally a dandyand theyve been keeping him in the firehouse and not letting him bathe and every day hes been insisting that he wanted a bath and finally they led him out of his cell onto the square and there was a long horse trough where the whole regiment had bathed in the same water And they told him he could bathe there and he said No that he preferred his own brand of Southern dirt to Yankee dirt and Scarlett heard the cheerful babbling voice going on and on but she did not hear the words In her mind there were only two ideas Rhett had more money than she had even hoped and he was in jail The fact that he was in jail and possibly might be hanged changed the face of matters somewhat in fact made them look a little brighter She had very little feeling about Rhett being hanged Her need of money was too pressing too desperate for her to bother about his ultimate fate Besides she half shared Dr Meades opinion that hanging was too good for him Any man whod leave a woman stranded between two armies in the middle of the night just to go off and fight for a Cause already lost deserved hanging  If she could somehow manage to marry him while he was in jail all those millions would be hers and hers alone should he be executed And if marriage was not possible perhaps she could get a loan from him by promising to marry him when he was released or by promisingoh promising anything And if they hanged him her day of settlement would never come For a moment her imagination flamed at the thought of being made a widow by the kindly intervention of the Yankee government Millions in gold She could repair Tara and hire hands and plant miles and miles of cotton And she could have pretty clothes and all she wanted to eat and so could Suellen and Carreen And Wade could have nourishing food to fill out his thin cheeks and warm clothes and a governess and afterward go to the university  and not grow up barefooted and ignorant like a Cracker And a good doctor could look after Pa and as for Ashleywhat couldnt she do for Ashley Aunt Pittypats monologue broke off suddenly as she said inquiringly Yes Mammy and Scarlett coming back from dreams saw Mammy standing in the doorway her hands under her apron and in her eyes an alert piercing look She wondered how long Mammy had been standing there and how much she had heard and observed Probably everything to judge by the gleam in her old eyes Miss Scarlett look lak she tared Ah spec she better go ter bed I am tired said Scarlett rising and meeting Mammys eyes with a childlike helpless look and Im afraid Im catching a cold too Aunt Pitty would you mind if I stayed in bed tomorrow and didnt go calling with you I can go calling any time and Im so anxious to go to Fannys wedding tomorrow night And if my cold gets worse I wont be able to go And a day in bed would be such a lovely treat for me  Page    Gone With The Wind Mammys look changed to faint worry as she felt Scarletts hands and looked into her face She certainly didnt look well The excitement of her thoughts had abruptly ebbed leaving her white and shaking Yo hans lak ice honey You come ter bed an Ahll brew you some sassfrass tea an git you a hot brick ter mek you sweat How thoughtless Ive been cried the plump old lady hopping from her chair and patting Scarletts arm Just chattering on and not thinking of you Honey you shall stay in bed all tomorrow and rest up and we can gossip together Oh dear no I cant be with you Ive promised to sit with Mrs Bonnell tomorrow She is down with la grippe and so is her cook Mammy Im so glad you are here You must go over with me in the morning and help me Mammy hurried Scarlett up the dark stairs muttering fussy remarks about cold hands and thin shoes and Scarlett looked meek and was well content If she could only lull Mammys suspicions further and get her out of the house in the morning all would be well Then she could go to the Yankee jail and see Rhett As she climbed the stairs the faint rumbling of thunder began and standing on the wellremembered landing she thought how like the siege cannon it sounded She shivered Forever thunder would mean cannon and war to her CHAPTER XXXIV THE SUN SHONE intermittently the next morning and the hard wind that drove dark clouds swiftly across its face rattled the windowpanes and moaned faintly about the house Scarlett said a brief prayer of thanksgiving that the rain of the previous night had ceased for she had lain awake listening to it knowing that it would mean the ruin of her velvet dress and new bonnet Now that she could catch fleeting glimpses of the sun her spirits soared She could hardly remain in bed and look languid and make croaking noises until Aunt Pitty Mammy and Uncle Peter were out of the house and on their way to Mrs Bonnells When at last the front gate banged and she was alone in the house except for Cookie who was singing in the kitchen she leaped from the bed and lifted her new clothes from the closet hooks Sleep had refreshed her and given her strength and from the cold hard core at the bottom of her heart she drew courage There was something about the prospect of a straggle of wits with a manwith any manthat put her on her mettle and after months of battling against countless discouragements the knowledge that she was at last facing a definite adversary one whom she might unhorse by her own efforts gave her a buoyant sensation Dressing unaided was difficult but she finally accomplished it and putting on the bonnet with its rakish feathers she ran to Aunt Pittys room to preen herself in front of the long mirror How pretty she looked The cock feathers gave her a dashing air and the dullgreen velvet of the bonnet made her eyes startlingly bright almost emerald colored And the dress was incomparable so rich and handsome looking and yet so dignified It was wonderful to have a lovely dress again It was so nice to know that she looked pretty and provocative and she impulsively bent forward and kissed her reflection in the mirror and then laughed at her own foolishness She picked up Ellens Paisley shawl to wrap about her but the colors of the faded old square clashed with the mossgreen dress and made her appear a little shabby Opening Aunt Pittys closet she removed a black broadcloth cloak a thin fall garment which Pitty used only for Sunday wear and put it on She slipped into her pierced ears the diamond earrings she had brought from Tara and tossed her head to observe the effect They made pleasant clicking noises which were very satisfactory and she thought that she must remember to toss her head frequently when with Rhett Dancing earrings always attracted a man and gave a girl such a spirited air What a shame Aunt Pitty had no other gloves than the ones now on her fat hands No woman could really feel like a lady without gloves but Scarlett had not had a pair since she left Atlanta And the long months of hard work at Tara had roughened her hands until they were far from pretty Well it couldnt be helped Shed take Aunt Pittys little seal muff and hide her bare hands in it Scarlett felt that it gave her the final finishing touch of elegance No one looking at her now would suspect that poverty and want were standing at her shoulder It was so important that Rhett should not suspect He must not think that anything but tender feelings were driving her She tiptoed down the stairs and out of the house while Cookie bawled on unconcernedly in the kitchen She hastened down Baker Street to avoid the all seeing eyes of the neighbors and sat down on a carriage block on Ivy Street in front of a burned house to wait for some passing carriage or wagon which would give her a ride The sun dipped in and out from behind hurrying clouds lighting the street with a false brightness which had no warmth in it and the wind fluttered the lace of her pantalets It was colder than she had expected and she wrapped Aunt Pittys thin cloak about her and shivered impatiently Just as she was preparing to start walking the long way across town to the Yankee encampment a battered wagon appeared In it was an old woman with a lip full of snuff and a weatherbeaten face under a drab sunbonnet driving a dawdling old mule She was going in the direction of the city hall and she grudgingly gave Scarlett a ride But it was obvious that the dress bonnet and muff found no favor with her She thinks Im a hussy thought Scarlett And perhaps shes right at that When at last they reached the town square and the tall white cupola of the city hall loomed up she made her thanks climbed down from the wagon and watched the country woman drive off Looking around carefully to see that she was not observed she pinched her cheeks to give them color and bit her lips until they stung to make them red She adjusted the bonnet and smoothed back her hair and looked about the square The twostory redbrick city hall had survived the burning of the city But it looked forlorn and unkempt under the gray sky Surrounding the building completely and covering the square of land of which it was the center were row after row of army huts dingy and mud splashed Yankee soldiers loitered everywhere and Scarlett looked at them uncertainly some of her courage deserting her How would she go about finding Rhett in this enemy camp She looked down the street toward the firehouse and saw that the wide arched doors were closed and heavily barred and two sentries passed and repassed on each side of the building Rhett was in there But what should she say to the Yankee soldiers And what would they say to her She squared her shoulders If she hadnt been afraid to kill one Yankee she shouldnt fear merely talking to another She picked her way precariously across the stepping stones of the muddy street and walked forward until a sentry his blue overcoat buttoned high against the wind stopped her  Page    Gone With The Wind What is it Mam His voice had a strange midWestern twang but it was polite and respectful I want to see a man in therehe is a prisoner Well I dont know said the sentry scratching his head They are mighty particular about visitors and He stopped and peered into her face sharply Lord lady Dont you cry You go over to post headquarters and ask the officers Theyll let you see him I bet Scarlett who had no intention of crying beamed at him He turned to another sentry who was slowly pacing his beat Yeeah Bill Comeeer The second sentry a large man muffled in a blue overcoat from which villainous black whiskers burst came through the mud toward them You take this lady to headquarters Scarlett thanked him and followed the sentry Mind you dont turn your ankle on those stepping stones said the soldier taking her arm And youd better hist up your skirts a little to keep them out of the mud The voice issuing from the whiskers had the same nasal twang but was kind and pleasant and his hand was firm and respectful Why Yankees werent bad at all Its a mighty cold day for a lady to be out in said her escort Have you come a fer piece Oh yes from clear across the other side of town she said warming to the kindness in his voice This aint no weather for a lady to be out in said the soldier reprovingly with all this la grippe in the air Heres Post Command lady Whats the matter This housethis house is your headquarters Scarlett looked up at the lovely old dwelling facing on the square and could have cried She had been to so many parties in this house during the war It had been a gay beautiful place and nowthere was a large United States flag floating over it Whats the matter NothingonlyonlyI used to know the people who lived here Well thats too bad I guess they wouldnt know it themselves if they saw it for it shore is torn up on the inside Now you go on in Mam and ask for the captain She went up the steps caressing the broken white banisters and pushed open the front door The hall was dark and as cold as a vault and a shivering sentry was leaning against the closed folding doors of what had been in better days the dining room I want to see the captain she said He pulled back the doors and she entered the room her heart beating rapidly her face flushing with embarrassment and excitement There was a close stuffy smell in the room compounded of the smoking fire tobacco fames leather damp woolen uniforms and unwashed bodies She had a confused impression of bare walls with torn wallpaper rows of blue overcoats and slouch hats hung on nails a roaring fire a long table covered with papers and a group of officers in blue uniforms with brass buttons She gulped once and found her voice She mustnt let these Yankees know she was afraid She must look and be her prettiest and most unconcerned self The captain Im one captain said a fat man whose tunic was unbuttoned I want to see a prisoner Captain Rhett Butler Butler again Hes popular that man laughed the captain taking a chewed cigar from his mouth You a relative Mam Yeshishis sister He laughed again Hes got a lot of sisters one of them here yesterday Scarlett flushed One of those creatures Rhett consorted with probably that Watling woman And these Yankees thought she was another one It was unendurable Not even for Tara would she stay here another minute and be insulted She turned to the door and reached angrily for the knob but another officer was by her side quickly He was clean shaven and young and had merry kind eyes Just a minute Mam Wont you sit down here by the fire where its warm Ill go see what I can do about it What is your name He refused to see thelady who called yesterday She sank into the proffered chair glaring at the discomfited fat captain and gave her name The nice young officer slipped on his overcoat and left the room and the others took themselves off to the far end of the table where they talked in low tones and pawed at the papers She stretched her feet gratefully toward the fire realizing for the first time how cold they were and wishing she had thought to put a piece of cardboard over the hole in the sole of one slipper After a time voices murmured outside the door and she heard Rhetts laugh The door opened a cold draft swept the room and Rhett appeared hatless a long cape thrown carelessly across his shoulders He was dirty and unshaven and without a cravat but somehow jaunty despite his dishabille and his dark eyes were snapping joyfully at the sight of her Scarlett He had her hands in both of his and as always there was something hot and vital and exciting about his grip Before she quite knew what he was about he had bent and kissed her cheek his mustache tickling her As he felt the startled movement of her body away from him he hugged her about the shoulders and said My darling little sister and grinned down at her as if he relished her helplessness in resisting his caress She couldnt help laughing back at him for the advantage he had taken What a rogue he was Jail had not changed him one bit The fat captain was muttering through his cigar to the merryeyed officer Most irregular He should be in the firehouse You know the orders Oh for Gods sake Henry The lady would freeze in that barn Oh all right all right Its your responsibility  Page    Gone With The Wind I assure you gentlemen said Rhett turning to them but still keeping a grip on Scarletts shoulders mysister hasnt brought me any saws or files to help me escape They all laughed and as they did Scarlett looked quickly about her Good Heavens was she going to have to talk to Rhett before six Yankee officers Was he so dangerous a prisoner they wouldnt let him out of their sight Seeing her anxious glance the nice officer pushed open a door and spoke brief low words to two privates who had leaped to their feet at his entrance They picked up their rifles and went out into the hall closing the door behind them If you wish you may sit here in the orderly room said the young captain And dont try to bolt through that door The men are just outside You see what a desperate character I am Scarlett said Rhett Thank you Captain This is most kind of you He bowed carelessly and taking Scarletts arm pulled her to her feet and propelled her into the dingy orderly room She was never to remember what the room looked like except that it was small and dim and none too warm and there were handwritten papers tacked on the mutilated walls and chairs which had cowhide seats with the hair still on them When he had closed the door behind them Rhett came to her swiftly and bent over her Knowing his desire she turned her head quickly but smiled provocatively at him out of the corners of her eyes Cant I really kiss you now On the forehead like a good brother she answered demurely Thank you no I prefer to wait and hope for better things His eyes sought her lips and lingered there a moment But how good of you to come to see me Scarlett You are the first respectable citizen who has called on me since my incarceration and being in jail makes one appreciate friends When did you come to town Yesterday afternoon And you came out this morning Why my dear you are more than good He smiled down at her with the first expression of honest pleasure she had ever seen on his face Scarlett smiled inwardly with excitement and ducked her head as if embarrassed Of course I came out right away Aunt Pitty told me about you last night and II just couldnt sleep all night for thinking how awful it was Rhett Im so distressed Why Scarlett His voice was soft but there was a vibrant note in it and looking up into his dark face she saw in it none of the skepticism the jeering humor she knew so well Before his direct gaze her eyes fell again in real confusion Things were going even better than she hoped Its worth being in jail to see you again and to hear you say things like that I really couldnt believe my ears when they brought me your name You see I never expected you to forgive me for my patriotic conduct that night on the road near Rough and Ready But I take it that this call means you have forgiven me She could feel swift anger stir even at this late date as she thought of that night but she subdued it and tossed her head until the earrings danced No I havent forgiven you she said and pouted Another hope crushed And after I offered up myself for my country and fought barefooted in the snow at Franklin and got the finest case of dysentery you ever heard of for my pains I dont want to hear about yourpains she said still pouting hut smiling at him from tiptilted eyes I still think you were hateful that night and I never expect to forgive you Leaving me alone like that when anything might have happened to me But nothing did happen to you So you see my confidence in you was justified I knew youd get home safely and God help any Yankee who got in your way Rhett why on earth did you do such a silly thingenlisting at the last minute when you knew we were going to get licked And after all youd said about idiots who went out and got shot Scarlett spare me I am always overcome with shame when I think about it Well Im glad to learn you are ashamed of the way you treated me You misunderstand I regret to say that my conscience has not troubled me at all about deserting you But as for enlistingwhen I think of joining the army in varnished boots and a white linen suit and armed with only a pair of dueling pistols And those long cold miles in the snow after my boots wore out and I had no overcoat and nothing to eat  I cannot understand why I did not desert It was all the purest insanity But its in ones blood Southerners can never resist a losing cause But never mind my reasons Its enough that Im forgiven Youre not I think youre a hound But she caressed the last word until it might have been darling Dont fib Youve forgiven me Young ladies dont dare Yankee sentries to see a prisoner just for charitys sweet sake and come all dressed up in velvet and feathers and seal muffs too Scarlett how pretty you look Thank God you arent in rags or mourning I get so sick of women in dowdy old clothes and perpetual crpe You look like the Rue de la Paix Turn around my dear and let me look at you So he had noticed the dress Of course he would notice such things being Rhett She laughed in soft excitement and spun about on her toes her arms extended her hoops tilting up to show her lace trimmed pantalets His black eyes took her in from bonnet to heels in a glance that missed nothing that old impudent unclothing glance which always gave her goose bumps You look very prosperous and very very tidy And almost good enough to eat If it wasnt for the Yankees outsidebut you are quite safe my dear Sit down I wont take advantage of you as I did the last time I saw you He rubbed his cheek with pseudo ruefulness Honestly Scarlett dont you think you were a bit selfish that night Think of all I had done for you risked my lifestolen a horseand such a horse Rushed to the defense of Our Glorious Cause And what did I get for my pains Some hard words and a very hard slap in the face She sat down The conversation was not going in quite the direction she hoped He had seemed so nice when he first saw her so genuinely glad she had come He had almost seemed like a human being and not the perverse wretch she knew so well Must you always get something for your pains  Page    Gone With The Wind Why of course I am a monster of selfishness as you ought to know I always expect payment for anything I give That sent a slight chill through her but she rallied and jingled her earbobs again Oh you really arent so bad Rhett You just like to show off My word but you have changed he said and laughed What has made a Christian of you I have kept up with you through Miss Pittypat but she gave me no intimation that you had developed womanly sweetness Tell me more about yourself Scarlett What have you been doing since I last saw you The old irritation and antagonism which he roused in her was hot in her heart and she yearned to speak tart words But she smiled instead and the dimple crept into her cheek He had drawn a chair close beside hers and she leaned over and put a gentle hand on his arm in an unconscious manner Oh Ive been doing nicely thank you and everything at Tara is fine now Of course we had a dreadful time right after Sherman went through but after all he didnt burn the house and the darkies saved most of the livestock by driving it into the swamp And we cleared a fair crop this last fall twenty bales Of course thats practically nothing compared with what Tara can do but we havent many field hands Pa says of course well do better next year But Rhett its so dull in the country now Imagine there arent any balls or barbecues and the only thing people talk about is hard times Goodness I get sick of it Finally last week I got too bored to stand it any longer so Pa said I must take a trip and have a good time So I came up here to get me some frocks made and then Im going over to Charleston to visit my aunt Itll be lovely to go to balls again There she thought with pride I delivered that with just the right airy way Not too rich but certainly not poor You look beautiful in ball dresses my dear and you know it too worse luck I suppose the real reason you are going visiting is that you have run through the County swains and are seeking fresh ones in fields afar Scarlett had a thankful thought that Rhett had spent the last several months abroad and had only recently come back to Atlanta Otherwise he would never have made so ridiculous a statement She thought briefly of the County swains the ragged embittered little Fontaines the povertystricken Munroe boys the Jonesboro and Fayetteville beaux who were so busy plowing splitting rails and nursing sick old animals that they had forgotten such things as balls and pleasant flirtations ever existed But she put down this memory and giggled selfconsciously as if admitting the truth of his assertion Oh well she said deprecatingly You are a heartless creature Scarlett but perhaps thats part of your charm He smiled in his old way one corner of his mouth curving down but she knew he was complimenting her For of course you know you have more charm than the law should permit Even I have felt it casehardened though I am Ive often wondered what it was about you that made me always remember you for Ive known many ladies who were prettier than you and certainly more clever and I fear morally more upright and kind But somehow I always remembered you Even during the months since the surrender when I was in France and England and hadnt seen you or heard of you and was enjoying the society of many beautiful ladies I always remembered you and wondered what you were doing For a moment she was indignant that he should say other women were prettier more clever and kind than she but that momentary flare was wiped out in her pleasure that he had remembered her and her charm So he hadnt forgotten That would make things easier And he was behaving so nicely almost like a gentleman would do under the circumstances Now all she had to do was bring the subject around to himself so she could intimate that she had not forgotten him either and then She gently squeezed his arm and dimpled again Oh Rhett how you do run on teasing a country girl like me I know mighty well you never gave me a thought after you left me that night You cant tell me you ever thought of me with all those pretty French and English girls around you But I didnt come all the way out here to hear you talk foolishness about me I cameI came because Because Oh Rhett Im so terribly distressed about you So frightened for you When will they let you out of that terrible place He swiftly covered her hand with his and held it hard against his arm Your distress does you credit Theres no telling when Ill be out Probably when theyve stretched the rope a bit more The rope Yes I expect to make my exit from here at the ropes end They wont really hang you They will if they can get a little more evidence against me Oh Rhett she cried her hand at her heart Would you be sorry If you are sorry enough Ill mention you in my will His dark eyes laughed at her recklessly and he squeezed her hand His will She hastily cast down her eyes for fear of betrayal but not swiftly enough for his eyes gleamed suddenly curious According to the Yankees I ought to have a fine will There seems to be considerable interest in my finances at present Every day I am hauled up before another board of inquiry and asked foolish questions The rumor seems current that I made off with the mythical gold of the Confederacy Welldid you What a leading question You know as well as I do that the Confederacy ran a printing press instead of a mint Where did you get all your money Speculating Aunt Pittypat said What probing questions you ask Damn him Of course he had the money She was so excited it became difficult to talk sweetly to him Rhett Im so upset about your being here Dont you think theres a chance of your getting out  Nihil desperandum is my motto What does that mean It means maybe my charming ignoramus She fluttered her thick lashes up to look at him and fluttered them down again  Page    Gone With The Wind Oh youre too smart to let them hang you I know youll think of some clever way to beat them and get out And when you do And when I do he asked softly leaning closer Well I and she managed a pretty confusion and a blush The blush was not difficult for she was breathless and her heart was beating like a drum Rhett Im so sorry about what II said to you that nightyou knowat Rough and Ready I wasoh so very frightened and upset and you were soso She looked down and saw his brown hand tighten over hers AndI thought then that Id never never forgive you But when Aunt Pitty told me yesterday that youthat they might hang youit came over me of a sudden and II She looked up into his eyes with one swift imploring glance and in it she put an agony of heartbreak Oh Rhett Id die if they hanged you I couldnt bear it You see I And because she could not longer sustain the hot leaping light that was in his eyes her lids fluttered down again In a moment Ill be crying she thought in a frenzy of wonder and excitement Shall I let myself cry Would that seem more natural He said quickly My God Scarlett you cant mean that you and his hands closed over hers in so hard a grip that it hurt She shut her eyes tightly trying to squeeze out tears but remembered to turn her face up slightly so he could kiss her with no difficulty Now in an instant his lips would be upon hers the hard insistent lips which she suddenly remembered with a vividness that left her weak But he did not kiss her Disappointment queerly stirring her she opened her eyes a trifle and ventured a peep at him His black head was bent over her hands and as she watched he lifted one and kissed it and taking the other laid it against his cheek for a moment Expecting violence this gentle and loverlike gesture startled her She wondered what expression was on his face but could not tell for his head was bowed She quickly lowered her gaze lest he should look up suddenly and see the expression on her face She knew that the feeling of triumph surging through her was certain to be plain in her eyes In a moment he would ask her to marry himor at least say that he loved her and then  As she watched him through the veil of her lashes he turned her hand over palm up to kiss it too and suddenly he drew a quick breath Looking down she saw her own palm saw it as it really was for the first time in a year and a cold sinking fear gripped her This was a strangers palm not Scarlett OHaras soft white dimpled helpless one This hand was rough from work brown with sunburn splotched with freckles The nails were broken and irregular there were heavy calluses on the cushions of the palm a halfhealed blister on the thumb The red scar which boiling fat had left last month was ugly and glaring She looked at it in horror and before she thought she swiftly clenched her fist Still he did not raise his head Still she could not see his face He pried her fist open inexorably and stared at it picked up her other hand and held them both together silently looking down at them Look at me he said finally raising his head and his voice was very quiet And drop that demure expression Unwillingly she met his eyes defiance and perturbation on her face His black brows were up and his eyes gleamed So you have been doing very nicely at Tara have you Cleared so much money on the cotton you can go visiting What have you been doing with your handsplowing She tried to wrench them away but he held them hard running his thumbs over the calluses These are not the hands of a lady he said and tossed them into her lap Oh shut up she cried feeling a momentary intense relief at being able to speak her feelings Whose business is it what I do with my hands What a fool I am she thought vehemently I should have borrowed or stolen Aunt Pittys gloves But I didnt realize my hands looked so bad Of course he would notice them And now Ive lost my temper and probably ruined everything Oh to have this happen when he was right at the point of a declaration Your hands are certainly no business of mine said Rhett coolly and lounged back in his chair indolently his face a smooth blank So he was going to be difficult Well shed have to bear it meekly much as she disliked it if she expected to snatch victory from this debacle Perhaps if she sweettalked him I think youre real rude to throw off on my poor hands Just because I went riding last week without my gloves and ruined them Riding hell he said in the same level voice Youve been working with those hands working like a nigger Whats the answer Why did you lie to me about everything being nice at Tara Now Rhett Suppose we get down to the truth What is the real purpose of your visit Almost I was persuaded by your coquettish airs that you cared something about me and were sorry for me Oh I am sorry Indeed No you arent They can hang me higher than Haman for all you care Its written as plainly on your face as hard work is written on your hands You wanted something from me and you wanted it badly enough to put on quite a show Why didnt you come out in the open and tell me what it was Youd have stood a much better chance of getting it for if theres one virtue I value in women its frankness But no you had to come jingling your earbobs and pouting and frisking like a prostitute with a prospective client He did not raise his voice at the last words or emphasize them in any way but to Scarlett they cracked like a whiplash and with despair she saw the end of her hopes of getting him to propose marriage Had he exploded with rage and injured vanity or upbraided her as other men would have done she could have handled him But the deadly quietness of his voice frightened her left her utterly at a loss as to her next move Although he was a prisoner and the Yankees were in the next room it came to her suddenly that Rhett Butler was a dangerous man to run afoul of I suppose my memory is getting faulty I should have recalled that you are just like me and that you never do anything without an ulterior motive Now let me see What could you have had up your sleeve Mrs Hamilton It isnt possible that you were so misguided as to think I would propose matrimony  Page    Gone With The Wind Her face went crimson and she did not answer But you cant have forgotten my oftrepeated remark that I am not a marrying man When she did not speak he said with sudden violence You hadnt forgotten Answer me I hadnt forgotten she said wretchedly What a gambler you are Scarlett he jeered You took a chance that my incarceration away from female companionship would put me in such a state Id snap at you like a trout at a worm And thats what you did thought Scarlett with inward rage and if it hadnt been for my hands Now we have most of the truth everything except your reason See if you can tell me the truth about why you wanted to lead me into wedlock There was a suave almost teasing note in his voice and she took heart Perhaps everything wasnt lost after all Of course she had ruined any hope of marriage but even in her despair she was glad There was something about this immobile man which frightened her so that now the thought of marrying him was fearful But perhaps if she was clever and played on his sympathies and his memories she could secure a loan She pulled her face into a placating and childlike expression Oh Rhett you can help me so muchif youll just be sweet Theres nothing I like better than beingsweet Rhett for old friendships sake I want you to do me a favor So at last the hornyhanded lady comes to her real mission I feared that visiting the sick and the imprisoned was not your proper role What do you want Money The bluntness of his question ruined all hopes of leading up to the matter in any circuitous and sentimental way Dont be mean Rhett she coaxed I do want some money I want you to lend me three hundred dollars The truth at last Talking love and thinking money How truly feminine Do you need the money badly Oh ye Well not so terribly but I could use it Three hundred dollars Thats a vast amount of money What do you want it for To pay taxes on Tara So you want to borrow some money Well since youre so businesslike Ill be businesslike too What collateral will you give me What what Collateral Security on my investment Of course I dont want to lose all that money His voice was deceptively smooth almost silky but she did not notice Maybe everything would turn out nicely after all My earrings Im not interested in earrings Ill give you a mortgage on Tara Now just what would I do with a farm Well you couldyou couldits a good plantation And you wouldnt lose Id pay you back out of next years cotton Im not so sure He tilted back in his chair and stuck his hands in his pockets Cotton prices are dropping Times are so hard and moneys so tight Oh Rhett you are teasing me You know you have millions There was a warm dancing malice in his eyes as he surveyed her So everything is going nicely and you dont need the money very badly Well Im glad to hear that I like to know that all is well with old friends Oh Rhett for Gods sake  she began desperately her courage and control breaking Do lower your voice You dont want the Yankees to hear you I hope Did anyone ever tell you you had eyes like a cata cat in the dark Rhett dont Ill tell you everything I do need the money so badly II lied about everything being all right Everythings as wrong as it could be Father isishes not himself Hes been queer ever since Mother died and he cant help me any Hes just like a child And we havent a single field hand to work the cotton and theres so many to feed thirteen of us And the taxesthey are so high Rhett Ill tell you everything For over a year weve been just this side of starvation Oh you dont know You cant know Weve never had enough to eat and its terrible to wake up hungry and go to sleep hungry And we havent any warm clothes and the children are always cold and sick and Where did you get the pretty dress Its made out of Mothers curtains she answered too desperate to lie about this shame I could stand being hungry and cold but nownow the Carpetbaggers have raised our taxes And the moneys got to be paid right away And I havent any money except one fivedollar gold piece Ive got to have money for the taxes Dont you see If I dont pay them Illwell lose Tara and we just cant lose it I cant let it go Why didnt you tell me all this at first instead of preying on my susceptible heartalways weak where pretty ladies are concerned No Scarlett dont cry Youve tried every trick except that one and I dont think I could stand it My feelings are already lacerated with disappointment at discovering it was my money and not my charming self you wanted She remembered that he frequently told bald truths about himself when he spoke mockinglymocking himself as well as others and she hastily looked up at him Were his feelings really hurt Did he really care about her Had he been on the verge of a proposal when he saw her palms Or had he only been leading up to another such odious proposal as he had made twice before If he really cared about her perhaps she could smooth him down But his black eyes raked her in no loverlike way and he was laughing softly I dont like your collateral Im no planter What else have you to offer Well she had come to it at last Now for it She drew a deep breath and met his eyes squarely all coquetry and airs gone as her  Page    Gone With The Wind spirit rushed out to grapple that which she feared most II have myself Yes Her jaw line tightened to squareness and her eyes went emerald You remember that night on Aunt Pittys porch during the siege You saidyou said then that you wanted me He leaned back carelessly in his chair and looked into her tense face and his own dark face was inscrutable Something flickered behind his eyes but he said nothing You saidyou said youd never wanted a woman as much as you wanted me If you still want me you can have me Rhett Ill do anything you say but for Gods sake write me a draft for the money My words good I swear it I wont go back on it Ill put it in writing if you like He looked at her oddly still inscrutable and as she hurried on she could not tell if he were amused or repelled If he would only say something anything She felt her cheeks getting hot I have got to have the money soon Rhett Theyll turn us out in the road and that damned overseer of Fathers will own the place and Just a minute What makes you think I still want you What makes you think you are worth three hundred dollars Most women dont come that high She blushed to her hair line and her humiliation was complete Why are you doing this Why not let the farm go and live at Miss Pittypats You own half that house Name of God she cried Are you a fool I cant let Tara go Its home I wont let it go Not while Ive got breath left in me The Irish said he lowering his chair back to level and removing his hands from his pockets are the damnedest race They put so much emphasis on so many wrong things Land for instance And every bit of earth is just like every other bit Now let me get this straight Scarlett You are coming to me with a business proposition Ill give you three hundred dollars and youll become my mistress Yes Now that the repulsive word had been said she felt somehow easier and hope awoke in her again He had said Ill give you There was a diabolic gleam in his eyes as if something amused him greatly And yet when I had the effrontery to make you this same proposition you turned me out of the house And also you called me a number of very hard names and mentioned in passing that you didnt want a passel of brats No my dear Im not rubbing it in Im only wondering at the peculiarities of your mind You wouldnt do it for your own pleasure but you will to keep the wolf away from the door It proves my point that all virtue is merely a matter of prices Oh Rhett how you run on If you want to insult me go on and do it but give me the money She was breathing easier now Being what he was Rhett would naturally want to torment and insult her as much as possible to pay her back for past slights and for her recent attempted trickery Well she could stand it She could stand anything Tara was worth it all For a brief moment it was midsummer and the afternoon skies were blue and she lay drowsily in the thick clover of Taras lawn looking up at the billowing cloud castles the fragrance of white blossoms in her nose and the pleasant busy humming of bees in her ears Afternoon and hush and the faroff sound of the wagons coming in from the spiraling red fields Worth it all worth more Her head went up Are you going to give me the money He looked as if he were enjoying himself and when he spoke there was suave brutality in his voice No Im not he said For a moment her mind could not adjust itself to his words I couldnt give it to you even if I wanted to I havent a cent on me Not a dollar in Atlanta I have some money yes but not here And Im not saying where it is or how much But if I tried to draw a draft on it the Yankees would be on me like a duck on a June bug and then neither of us would get it What do you think of that Her face went an ugly green freckles suddenly standing out across her nose and her contorted mouth was like Geralds in a killing rage She sprang to her feet with an incoherent cry which made the hum of voices in the next room cease suddenly Swift as a panther Rhett was beside her his heavy hand across her mouth his arm tight about her waist She struggled against him madly trying to bite his hand to kick his legs to scream her rage despair hate her agony of broken pride She bent and twisted every way against the iron of his arm her heart near bursting her tight stays cutting off her breath He held her so tightly so roughly that it hurt and the hand over her mouth pinched into her jaws cruelly His face was white under its tan his eyes hard and anxious as he lifted her completely off her feet swung her up against his chest and sat down in the chair holding her writhing in his lap Darling for Gods sake Stop Hush Dont yell Theyll be in here in a minute if you do Do calm yourself Do you want the Yankees to see you like this She was beyond caring who saw her beyond anything except a fiery desire to kill him but dizziness was sweeping her She could not breathe he was choking her her stays were like a swiftly compressing band of iron his arms about her made her shake with helpless hate and fury Then his voice became thin and dim and his face above her swirled in a sickening mist which became heavier and heavier until she no longer saw himor anything else When she made feeble swimming motions to come back to consciousness she was tired to her bones weak bewildered She was lying back in the chair her bonnet off Rhett was slapping her wrist his black eyes searching her face anxiously The nice young captain was trying to pour a glass of brandy into her mouth and had spilled it down her neck The other officers hovered helplessly about whispering and waving their hands Iguess I must have fainted she said and her voice sounded so far away it frightened her  Page    Gone With The Wind Drink this said Rhett taking the glass and pushing it against her lips Now she remembered and glared feebly at him but she was too tired for anger Please for my sake She gulped and choked and began coughing but he pushed it to her mouth again She swallowed deeply and the hot liquid burned suddenly in her throat I think shes better now gentlemen said Rhett and I thank you very much The realization that Im to be executed was too much for her The group in blue shuffled their feet and looked embarrassed and after several clearings of throats they tramped out The young captain paused in the doorway If theres anything more I can do No thank you He went out closing the door behind him Drink some more said Rhett No Drink it She swallowed another mouthful and the warmth began spreading through her body and strength flowed slowly back into her shaking legs She pushed away the glass and tried to rise but he pressed her back Take your hands off me Im going Not yet Wait a minute You might faint again Id rather faint in the road than be here with you Just the same I wont have you fainting in the road Let me go I hate you A faint smile came back to his face at her words That sounds more like you You must be feeling better She lay relaxed for a moment trying to summon anger to her aid trying to draw on her strength But she was too tired She was too tired to hate or to care very much about anything Defeat lay on her spirit like lead She had gambled everything and lost everything Not even pride was left This was the dead end of her last hope This was the end of Tara the end of them all For a long time she lay back with her eyes closed hearing his heavy breathing near her and the glow of the brandy crept gradually over her giving a false strength and warmth When finally she opened her eyes and looked him in the face anger had roused again As her slanting eyebrows rushed down together in a frown Rhetts old smile came back Now you are better I can tell it by your scowl Of course Im all right Rhett Butler you are hateful a skunk if ever I saw one You knew very well what I was going to say as soon as I started talking and you knew you werent going to give me the money And yet you let me go right on You could have spared me Spared you and missed hearing all that Not much I have so few diversions here I dont know when Ive ever heard anything so gratifying He laughed his sudden mocking laugh At the sound she leaped to her feet snatching up her bonnet He suddenly had her by the shoulders Not quite yet Do you feel well enough to talk sense Let me go You are well enough I see Then tell me this Was I the only iron you had in the fire His eyes were keen and alert watching every change in her face What do you mean Was I the only man you were going to try this on Is that any of your business More than you realize Are there any other men on your string Tell me No Incredible I cant imagine you without five or six in reserve Surely someone will turn up to accept your interesting proposition I feel so sure of it that I want to give you a little advice I dont want your advice Nevertheless I will give it Advice seems to be the only thing I can give you at present Listen to it for its good advice When you are trying to get something out of a man dont blurt it out as you did to me Do try to be more subtle more seductive It gets better results You used to know how to perfection But just now when you offered me yourercollateral for my money you looked as hard as nails Ive seen eyes like yours above a dueling pistol twenty paces from me and they arent a pleasant sight They evoke no ardor in the male breast Thats no way to handle men my dear You are forgetting your early training I dont need you to tell me how to behave she said and wearily put on her bonnet She wondered how he could jest so blithely with a rope about his neck and her pitiful circumstances before him She did not even notice that his hands were jammed in his pockets in hard fists as if he were straining at his own impotence Cheer up he said as she tied the bonnet strings You can come to my hanging and it will make you feel lots better Itll even up all your old scores with meeven this one And Ill mention you in my will Thank you but they may not hang you till its too late to pay the taxes she said with a sudden malice that matched his own and she meant it CHAPTER XXXV IT WAS RAINING when she came out of the building and the sky was a dull putty color The soldiers on the square had taken  Page    Gone With The Wind shelter in their huts and the streets were deserted There was no vehicle in sight and she knew she would have to walk the long way home The brandy glow faded as she trudged along The cold wind made her shiver and the chilly needlelike drops drove hard into her face The rain quickly penetrated Aunt Pittys thin cloak until it hung in clammy folds about her She knew the velvet dress was being ruined and as for the tail feathers on the bonnet they were as drooping and draggled as when their former owner had worn them about the wet barn yard of Tara The bricks of the sidewalk were broken and for long stretches completely gone In these spots the mud was ankle deep and her slippers stuck in it as if it were glue even coming completely off her feet Every time she bent over to retrieve them the hem of the dress fell in the mud She did not even try to avoid puddles but stepped dully into them dragging her heavy skirts after her She could feel her wet petticoat and pantalets cold about her ankles but she was beyond caring about the wreck of the costume on which she had gambled so much She was chilled and disheartened and desperate How could she ever go back to Tara and face them after her brave words How could she tell them they must all gosomewhere How could she leave it all the red fields the tall pines the dark swampy bottom lands the quiet burying ground where Ellen lay in the cedars deep shade Hatred of Rhett burned in her heart as she plodded along the slippery way What a blackguard he was She hoped they did hang him so she would never have to face him again with his knowledge of her disgrace and her humiliation Of course he could have gotten the money for her if hed wanted to get it Oh hanging was too good for him Thank God he couldnt see her now with her clothes soaking wet and her hair straggling and her teeth chattering How hideous she must look and how he would laugh The negroes she passed turned insolent grins at her and laughed among themselves as she hurried by slipping and sliding in the mud stopping panting to replace her slippers How dared they laugh the black apes How dared they grin at her Scarlett OHara of Tara Shed like to have them all whipped until the blood ran down their backs What devils the Yankees were to set them free free to jeer at white people As she walked down Washington Street the landscape was as dreary as her own heart Here there was none of the bustle and cheerfulness which she had noted on Peachtree Street Here many handsome homes had once stood but few of them had been rebuilt Smoked foundations and the lonesome blackened chimneys now known as Shermans Sentinels appeared with disheartening frequency Overgrown paths led to what had been housesold lawns thick with dead weeds carriage blocks bearing names she knew so well hitching posts which would never again know the knot of reins Cold wind and rain mud and bare trees silence and desolation How wet her feet were and how long the journey home She heard the splash of hooves behind her and moved farther over on the narrow sidewalk to avoid more mud splotches on Aunt Pittypats cloak A horse and buggy came slowly up the road and she turned to watch it determined to beg a ride if the driver was a white person The rain obscured her vision as the buggy came abreast but she saw the driver peer over the tarpaulin that stretched from the dashboard to his chin There was something familiar about his face and as she stepped out into the road to get a closer view there was an embarrassed little cough from the man and a wellknown voice cried in accents of pleasure and astonishment Surely it cant be Miss Scarlett Oh Mr Kennedy she cried splashing across the road and leaning on the muddy wheel heedless of further damage to the cloak I was never so glad to see anybody in my life He colored with pleasure at the obvious sincerity of her words hastily squirted a stream of tobacco juice from the opposite side of the buggy and leaped spryly to the ground He shook her hand enthusiastically and holding up the tarpaulin assisted her into the buggy Miss Scarlett what are you doing over in this section by yourself Dont you know ifs dangerous these days And you are soaking wet Here wrap the robe around your feet As he fussed over her clucking like a hen she gave herself up to the luxury of being taken care of It was nice to have a man fussing and clucking and scolding even if it was only that old maid in pants Frank Kennedy It was especially soothing after Rhetts brutal treatment And oh how good to see a County face when she was so far from home He was well dressed she noticed and the buggy was new too The horse looked young and well fed but Frank looked far older than his years older than on that Christmas eve when he had been at Tara with his men He was thin and sallow faced and his yellow eyes were watery and sunken in creases of loose flesh His gingercolored beard was scantier than ever streaked with tobacco juice and as ragged as if he clawed at it incessantly But he looked bright and cheerful in contrast with the lines of sorrow and worry and weariness which Scarlett saw in faces everywhere Its a pleasure to see you said Frank warmly I didnt know you were in town I saw Miss Pittypat only last week and she didnt tell me you were coming Diderahemdid anyone else come op from Tara with you He was thinking of Suellen the silly old fool No she said wrapping the warm lap robe about her and trying to pull it up around her neck I came alone I didnt give Aunt Pitty any warning He chirruped to the horse and it plodded off picking its way carefully down the slick road All the folks at Tara well Oh yes soso She must think of something to talk about yet it was so hard to talk Her mind was leaden with defeat and all she wanted was to lie back in this warm blanket and say to herself I wont think of Tara now Ill think of it later when it wont hurt so much If she could just get him started talking on some subject which would hold him all the way home so she would have nothing to do but murmur How nice and You certainly are smart at intervals Mr Kennedy Im so surprised to see you I know Ive been a bad girl not keeping up with old friends but I didnt know you were here in Atlanta I thought somebody told me you were in Marietta I do business in Marietta a lot of business he said Didnt Miss Suellen tell you I had settled in Atlanta Didnt she tell you about my store Vaguely she had a memory of Suellen chattering about Frank and a store but she never paid much heed to anything Suellen said  Page    Gone With The Wind It had been sufficient to know that Frank was alive and would some day take Suellen off her hands No not a word she lied Have you a store How smart you must be He looked a little hurt at hearing that Suellen had not published the news but brightened at the flattery Yes Ive got a store and a pretty good one I think Folks tell me Im a born merchant He laughed pleasedly the tittery cackling laugh which she always found so annoying Conceited old fool she thought Oh you could be a success at anything you turned your hand to Mr Kennedy But how on earth did you ever get started with the store When I saw you Christmas before last you said you didnt have a cent in the world He cleared his throat raspingly clawed at his whiskers and smiled his nervous timid smile Well its a long story Miss Scarlett Thank the Lord she thought Perhaps it will hold him till we get home And aloud Do tell You recall when we came to Tara last hunting for supplies Well not long after that I went into active service I mean real fighting No more commissary for me There wasnt much need for a commissary Miss Scarlett because we couldnt hardly pick up a thing for the army and I thought the place for an ablebodied man was in the fighting line Well I fought along with the cavalry for a spell till I got a minie ball through the shoulder He looked very proud and Scarlett said How dreadful Oh it wasnt so bad just a flesh wound he said deprecatingly I was sent down south to a hospital and when I was just about well the Yankee raiders came through My my but that was a hot time We didnt have much warning and all of us who could walk helped haul out the army stores and the hospital equipment to the train tracks to move it Wed gotten one train about loaded when the Yankees rode in one end of town and out we went the other end as fast as we could go My my that was a mighty sad sight sitting on top of that train and seeing the Yankees burn those supplies we had to leave at the depot Miss Scarlett they burned about a halfmile of stuff we had piled up there along the tracks We just did get away ourselves How dreadful Yes thats the word Dreadful Our men had come back into Atlanta then and so our train was sent here Well Miss Scarlett it wasnt long before the war was over andwell there was a lot of china and cots and mattresses and blankets and nobody claiming them I suppose rightfully they belonged to the Yankees I think those were the terms of the surrender werent they Um said Scarlett absently She was getting warmer now and a little drowsy I dont know till now if I did right he said a little querulously But the way I figured it all that stuff wouldnt do the Yankees a bit of good Theyd probably burn it And our folks had paid good solid money for it and I thought it still ought to belong to the Confederacy or to the Confederates Do you see what I mean Um Im glad you agree with me Miss Scarlett In a way its been on my conscience Lots of folks have told me Oh forget about it Frank but I cant I couldnt hold up my head if I thought Id done what wasnt right Do you think I did right Of course she said wondering what the old fool had been talking about Some struggle with his conscience When a man got as old as Frank Kennedy he ought to have learned not to bother about things that didnt matter But he always was so nervous and fussy and old maidish Im glad to hear you say it After the surrender I had about ten dollars in silver and nothing else in the world You know what they did to Jonesboro and my house and store there I just didnt know what to do But I used the ten dollars to put a roof on an old store down by Five Points and I moved the hospital equipment in and started selling it Everybody needed beds and china and mattresses and I sold them cheap because I figured it was about as much other folks stuff as it was mine But I cleared money on it and bought some more stuff and the store just went along fine I think Ill make a lot of money on it if things pick up At the word money her mind came back to him crystal clear You say youve made money He visibly expanded under her interest Few women except Suellen had ever given him more than perfunctory courtesy and it was very flattering to have a former belle like Scarlett hanging on his words He slowed the horse so they would not reach home before he had finished his story Im not a millionaire Miss Scarlett and considering the money I used to have what Ive got now sounds small But I made a thousand dollars this year Of course five hundred of it went to paying for new stock and repairing the store and paying the rent But Ive made five hundred clear and as things are certainly picking up I ought to clear two thousand next year I can sure use it too for you see Ive got another iron in the fire Interest had sprung up sharply in her at the talk of money She veiled her eyes with thick bristly lashes and moved a little closer to him What does that mean Mr Kennedy He laughed and slapped the reins against the horses back I guess Im boring you talking about business Miss Scarlett A pretty little woman like you doesnt need to know anything about business The old fool Oh I know Im a goose about business but Im so interested Please tell me all about it and you can explain what I dont understand Well my other iron is a sawmill A what A mill to cut up lumber and plane it I havent bought it yet but Im going to Theres a man named Johnson who has one way out Peachtree road and hes anxious to sell it He needs some cash right away so he wants to sell and stay and run it for me at a weekly wage Its one of the few mills in this section Miss Scarlett The Yankees destroyed most of them And anyone who owns a sawmill owns a gold mine for nowadays you can ask your own price for lumber The Yankees burned so many houses here and  Page    Gone With The Wind there arent enough for people to live in and it looks like folks have gone crazy about rebuilding They cant get enough lumber and they cant get it fast enough People are just pouring into Atlanta now all the folks from the country districts who cant make a go of farming without darkies and the Yankees and Carpetbaggers who are swarming in trying to pick our bones a little barer than they already are I tell you Atlantas going to be a big town soon Theyve got to have lumber for their houses so Im going to buy this mill just as soon aswell as soon as some of the bills owing me are paid By this time next year I ought to be breathing easier about money II guess you know why Im so anxious to make money quickly dont you He blushed and cackled again Hes thinking of Suellen Scarlett thought in disgust For a moment she considered asking him to lend her three hundred dollars but wearily she rejected the idea He would be embarrassed he would stammer he would offer excuses but he wouldnt lend it to her He had worked hard for it so he could marry Suellen in the spring and if he parted with it his wedding would be postponed indefinitely Even if she worked on his sympathies and his duty toward his future family and gained his promise of a loan she knew Suellen would never permit it Suellen was getting more and more worried over the fact that she was practically an old maid and she would move heaven and earth to prevent anything from delaying her marriage What was there in that whining complaining girl to make this old fool so anxious to give her a soft nest Suellen didnt deserve a loving husband and the profits of store and a sawmill The minute Sue got her hands on a little money shed give herself unendurable airs and never contribute one cent toward the upkeep of Tara Not Suellen Shed think herself well out of it and not care if Tara went for taxes or burned to the ground so long as she had pretty clothes and a Mrs in front of her name As Scarlett thought of Suellens secure future and the precarious one of herself and Tara anger flamed in her at the unfairness of life Hastily she looked out of the buggy into the muddy street lest Frank should see her expression She was going to lose everything she had while Sue Suddenly a determination was born in her Suellen should not have Frank and his store and his mill Suellen didnt deserve them She was going to have them herself She thought of Tara and remembered Jonas Wilkerson venomous as a rattler at the foot of the front steps and she grasped at the last straw floating above the shipwreck of her life Rhett had failed her but the Lord had provided Frank But can I get him Her fingers clenched as she looked unseeingly into the rain Can I make him forget Sue and propose to me real quick If I could make Rhett almost propose I know I could get Frank Her eyes went over him her lids flickering Certainly hes no beauty she thought coolly and hes got very bad teeth and his breath smells bad and hes old enough to be my father Moreover hes nervous and timid and well meaning and I dont know of any more damning qualities a man can have But at least hes a gentleman and I believe I could stand living with him better than with Rhett Certainly I could manage him easier At any rate beggars cant be choosers That he was Suellens fianc caused her no qualm of conscience After the complete moral collapse which had sent her to Atlanta and to Rhett the appropriation of her sisters betrothed seemed a minor affair and one not to be bothered with at this time With the rousing of fresh hope her spine stiffened and she forgot that her feet were wet and cold She looked at Frank so steadily her eyes narrowing that he became somewhat alarmed and she dropped her gaze swiftly remembering Rhetts words Ive seen eyes like yours above a dueling pistol  They evoke no ardor in the male breast Whats the matter Miss Scarlett You got a chill Yes she answered helplessly Would you mind She hesitated timidly Would you mind if I put my hand in your coat pocket Its so cold and my muff is soaked through Whywhyof course not And you havent any gloves My my what a brute Ive been idling along like this talking my head off when you must be freezing and wanting to get to a fire Giddap Sally By the way Miss Scarlett Ive been so busy talking about myself I havent even asked you what you were doing in this section in this weather I was at the Yankee headquarters she answered before she thought His sandy brows went up in astonishment But Miss Scarlett The soldiers Why Mary Mother of God let me think of a real good lie she prayed hastily It would never do for Frank to suspect she had seen Rhett Frank thought Rhett the blackest of blackguards and unsafe for decent women to speak to I went thereI went there to see ifif any of the officers would buy fancy work from me to send home to their wives I embroider very nicely He sank back against the seat aghast indignation struggling with bewilderment You went to the Yankees But Miss Scarlett You shouldnt Whywhy  Surely your father doesnt know Surely Miss Pittypat Oh I shall die if you tell Aunt Pittypat she cried in real anxiety and burst into tears It was easy to cry because she was so cold and miserable but the effect was startling Frank could not have been more embarrassed or helpless if she had suddenly begun disrobing He clicked his tongue against his teeth several times muttering My My and made futile gestures at her A daring thought went through his mind that he should draw her head onto his shoulder and pat her but he had never done this to any woman and hardly knew how to go about it Scarlett OHara so high spirited and pretty crying here in his buggy Scarlett OHara the proudest of the proud trying to sell needlework to the Yankees His heart burned She sobbed on saying a few words now and then and he gathered that all was not well at Tara Mr OHara was still not himself at all and there wasnt enough food to go around for so many So she had to come to Atlanta to try to make a little money for herself and her boy Frank clicked his tongue again and suddenly he found that her head was on his shoulder He did not quite know how it got there Surely he had not placed it there but there her head was and there was Scarlett helplessly sobbing against his thin chest an exciting and novel sensation for him He patted her shoulder timidly gingerly at first and when she did not rebuff him he became bolder and patted her firmly What a helpless sweet womanly little thing she was And how brave and silly to try her hand at making money by her needle But dealing with the Yankeesthat was too much I wont tell Miss Pittypat but you must promise me Miss Scarlett that you wont do anything like this again The idea of your fathers daughter  Page    Gone With The Wind Her wet green eyes sought his helplessly But Mr Kennedy I must do something I must take care of my poor little boy and there is no one to look after us now You are a brave little woman he pronounced but I wont have you do this sort of thing Your family would die of shame Then what will I do The swimming eyes looked up to him as if she knew he knew everything and was hanging on his words Well I dont know right now But Ill think of something Oh I know you will You are so smartFrank She had never called him by his first name before and the sound came to him as a pleasant shock and surprise The poor girl was probably so upset she didnt even notice her slip He felt very kindly toward her and very protecting If there was anything he could do for Suellen OHaras sister he would certainly do it He pulled out a red bandanna handkerchief and handed it to her and she wiped her eyes and began to smile tremulously Im such a silly little goose she said apologetically Please forgive me You arent a silly little goose Youre a very brave little woman and you are trying to carry too heavy a load Im afraid Miss Pittypat isnt going to be much help to you I hear she lost most of her property and Mr Henry Hamiltons in bad shape himself I only wish I had a home to offer you shelter in But Miss Scarlett you just remember this when Miss Suellen and I are married therell always be a place for you under our roof and for Wade Hampton too Now was the time Surely the saints and angels watched over her to give her such a Heavensent opportunity She managed to look very startled and embarrassed and opened her mouth as if to speak quickly and then shut it with a pop Dont ten me you didnt know I was to be your brotherinlaw this spring he said with nervous jocularity And then seeing her eyes fill up with tears he questioned in alarm Whats the matter Miss Sues not ill is she Oh no No There is something wrong You must tell me Oh I cant I didnt know I thought surely she must have written you Oh how mean Miss Scarlett what is it Oh Frank I didnt mean to let it out but I thought of course you knewthat she had written you Written me what He was trembling Oh to do this to a fine man like you Whats she done She didnt write you Oh I guess she was too ashamed to write you She should be ashamed Oh to have such a mean sister By this time Frank could not even get questions to his lips He sat staring at her gray faced the reins slack in his hands Shes going to marry Tony Fontaine next month Oh Im so sorry Frank So sorry to be the one to tell you She just got tired of waiting and she was afraid shed be an old maid Mammy was standing on the front porch when Frank helped Scarlett out of the buggy She had evidently been standing there for some time for her head rag was damp and the old shawl clutched tightly about her showed rain spots Her wrinkled black face was a study in anger and apprehension and her lip was pushed out farther than Scarlett could ever remember She peered quickly at Frank and when she saw who it was her face changed pleasure bewilderment and something akin to guilt spreading over it She waddled forward to Frank with pleased greetings and grinned and curtsied when he shook her hand It sho is good ter see home folks she said How is you Mist Frank My ain you lookin fine an gran Effen Ahd knowed Miss Scarlett wuz out wid you Ah wouldn worrit so Ahd knowed she wuz tekken keer of Ah come back hyah an fine she gone an Ah been as stracted as a chicken wid its haid off thinkin she runnin roun dis town by

just heard he smiled knowing she was enjoining silence and making him one in a pleasant conspiracy You run up and fix me some dry clothes Mammy she said And some hot tea Lawd yo new dress is plum ruint grumbled Mammy Ah gwine have a time dryin it an brushin it so itll be fit ter be wo ter de weddin ternight She went into the house and Scarlett leaned close to Frank and whispered Do come to supper tonight We are so lonesome And were going to the wedding afterward Do be our escort And please dont say anything to Aunt Pitty aboutabout Suellen It would distress her so much and I cant bear for her to know that my sister Oh I wont I wont Frank said hastily wincing from the very thought Youve been so sweet to me today and done me so much good I feel right brave again She squeezed his hand in parting and turned the full battery of her eyes upon him Mammy who was waiting just inside the door gave her an inscrutable look and followed her puffing up the stairs to the bedroom She was silent while she stripped off the wet clothes and hung them over chairs and tucked Scarlett into bed When she had brought up a cup of hot tea and a hot brick rolled in flannel she looked down at Scarlett and said with the nearest approach to an apology in her voice Scarlett had ever heard Lamb huccome you din tell yo own Mammy whut you wuz upter Den Ah wouldn had ter traipse all dis way up hyah ter Lanta Ah is too ole an too fat fer sech runnin roun What do you mean Honey you kain fool me Ah knows you An Ah seed Mist Franks face jes now an Ah seed yo face an Ah kin read yo mine lak a pahson read a

Melly dat dat rapscallion Butler man had lots of money an Ah doan fergit what Ah hears But Mist Frank he a gempmum even ef he ain so  Page    Gone With The Wind pretty Scarlett gave her a sharp look and Mammy returned the gaze with calm omniscience Well what are you going to do about it Tattle to Suellen Ah is gwine ter hep you pleasure Mist Frank evey way Ah knows how said Mammy tucking the covers about Scarletts neck Scarlett lay quietly for a while as Mammy fussed about the room relief flooding her that there was no need for words between them No explanations were asked no reproaches made Mammy understood and was silent In Mammy Scarlett had found a realist more uncompromising than herself The mottled wise old eyes saw deeply saw clearly with the directness of the savage and the child undeterred by conscience when danger threatened her pet Scarlett was her baby and what her baby wanted even though it belonged to another Mammy was willing to help her obtain The rights of Suellen and Frank Kennedy did not even enter her mind save to cause a grim inward chuckle Scarlett was in trouble and doing the best she could and Scarlett was Miss Ellens child Mammy rallied to her with never a moments hesitation Scarlett felt the silent reinforcement and as the hot brick at her feet warmed her the hope which had flickered faintly on the cold ride home grew into a flame It swept through her making her heart pump the blood through her veins in pounding surges Strength was coming back and a reckless excitement which made her want to laugh aloud Not beaten yet she thought exultantly Hand me the mirror Mammy she said Keep yo shoulders unner dat kivver ordered Mammy passing the hand mirror to her a smile on her thick lips Scarlett looked at herself I look white as a hant

would hant me Git back in baid Ahll go Maybe Ah fine me a sto what dey doan know us That night at Mrs Elsings when Fanny had been duly married and old Levi and the other musicians were tuning up for the dance Scarlett looked about her with gladness It was so exciting to be actually at a party again She was pleased also with the warm reception she had received When she entered the house on Franks arm everyone had rushed to her with cries of pleasure and welcome kissed her shaken her hand told her they had missed her dreadfully and that she must never go back to Tara The men seemed gallantly to have forgotten she had tried her best to break their hearts in other days and the girls that she had done everything in her power to entice their beaux away from them Even Mrs Merriwether Mrs Whiting Mrs Meade and the other dowagers who had been so cool to her during the last days of the war forgot her flighty conduct and their disapproval of it and recalled only that she had suffered in their common defeat and that she was Pittys niece and Charles widow They kissed her and spoke gently with tears in their eyes of her dear mothers passing and asked at length about her father and her sisters Everyone asked about Melanie and Ashley demanding the reason why they too had not come back to Atlanta In spite of her pleasure at the welcome Scarlett felt a slight uneasiness which she tried to conceal an uneasiness about the appearance of her velvet dress It was still damp to the knees and still spotted about the hem despite the frantic efforts of Mammy  Page    Gone With The Wind and Cookie with a steaming kettle a clean hair brush and frantic wavings in front of an open fire Scarlett was afraid someone would notice her bedraggled state and realize that this was her only nice dress She was a little cheered by the fact that many of the dresses of the other guests looked far worse than hers They were so old and had such carefully mended and pressed looks At least her dress was whole and new damp though it wasin fact the only new dress at the gathering with the exception of Fannys whitesatin wedding gown Remembering what Aunt Pitty had told her about the Elsing finances she wondered where the money for the satin dress had been obtained and for the refreshments and decorations and musicians too It must have cost a pretty penny Borrowed money probably or else the whole Elsing clan had contributed to give Fanny this expensive wedding Such a wedding in these hard times seemed to Scarlett an extravagance on a par with the tombstones of the Tarleton boys and she felt the same irritation and lack of sympathy she had felt as she stood in the Tarleton burying ground The days when money could be thrown away carelessly had passed Why did these people persist in making the gestures of the old days when the old days were gone But she shrugged off her momentary annoyance It wasnt her money and she didnt want her evenings pleasure spoiled by irritation at other peoples foolishness She discovered she knew the groom quite well for he was Tommy Wellburn from Sparta and she had nursed him in  when he had a wound in his shoulder He had been a handsome young sixfooter then and had given up his medical studies to go in the cavalry Now he looked like a little old man so bent was he by the wound in his hip He walked with some difficulty and as Aunt Pitty had remarked spraddled in a very vulgar way But he seemed totally unaware of his appearance or unconcerned about it and had the manner of one who asks no odds from any man He had given up all hope of continuing his medical studies and was now a contractor working a labor crew of Irishmen who were building the new hotel Scarlett wondered how he managed so onerous a job in his condition but asked no questions realizing wryly that almost anything was possible when necessity drove Tommy and Hugh Elsing and the little monkeylike Ren Picard stood talking with her while the chairs and furniture were pushed back to the wall in preparation for the dancing Hugh had not changed since Scarlett last saw him in  He was still the thin sensitive boy with the same lock of pale brown hair hanging over his forehead and the same delicate uselesslooking hands she remembered so well But Ren had changed since that furlough when he married Maybelle Merriwether He still had the Gallic twinkle in his black eyes and the Creole zest for living but for all his easy laughter there was something hard about his face which had not been there in the early days of the war And the air of supercilious elegance which had clung about him in his striking Zouave uniform was completely gone Cheeks lak ze rose eyes lak ze emerald he said kissing Scarletts hand and paying tribute to the rouge upon her face Pretty lak wen I first see you at ze bazaar You remembaire Nevaire have I forgot how you toss your wedding ring in my basket Ha but zat was brave But I should nevaire have zink you wait so long to get anothaire ring His eyes sparkled wickedly and he dug his elbow into Hughs ribs And I never thought youd be driving a pie wagon Renny Picard she said Instead of being ashamed at having his degrading occupation thrown in his face he seemed pleased and laughed uproariously slapping Hugh on the back Touch he cried Belle Mre Madame Merriwether she mek me do eet ze first work I do en all my life Ren Picard who was to grow old breeding ze race horse playing ze feedle Now I drive ze pie wagon and I lak eet Madame Belle Mre she can mek a man do annyzing She should have been ze general and we win ze war eh Tommy Well thought Scarlett The idea of liking to drive a pie wagon when his people used to own ten miles along the Mississippi River and a big house in New Orleans too If wed had our mothersinlaw in the ranks wed have beat the Yankees in a week agreed Tommy his eyes straying to the slender indomitable form of his new motherinlaw The only reason we lasted as long as we did was because of the ladies behind us who wouldnt give up Wholl never give up amended Hugh and his smile was proud but a little wry Theres not a lady here tonight who has surrendered no matter what her men folks did at Appomattox Its a lot worse on them than it ever was on us At least we took it out in fighting And they in hating finished Tommy Eh Scarlett It bothers the ladies to see what their men folks have come down to lots more than it bothers us Hugh was to be a judge Ren was to play the fiddle before the crowned heads of Europe He ducked as Ren aimed a blow at him And I was to be a doctor and now Geeve us ze time cried Ren Zen I become ze Pie Prince of ze South And my good Hugh ze King of ze Kindling and you my Tommy you weel own ze Irish slaves instead of ze darky slaves What changeswhat fun And what eet do for you Mees Scarlett and Mees Melly You meelk ze cow peek ze cotton Indeed no said Scarlett coolly unable to understand Rens gay acceptance of hardships Our darkies do that Mees Melly I hear she call her boy Beauregard You tell her I Ren approve and say that except for Jesus there is no bettaire name And though he smiled his eyes glowed proudly at the name of Louisianas dashing hero Well theres Robert Edward Lee  observed Tommy And while Im not trying to lessen Old Beaus reputation my first son is going to be named Bob Lee Wellburn  Ren laughed and shrugged I recount to you a joke but eet eez a true story And you see how Creoles zink of our brave Beauregard and of your General Lee On ze train near New Orleans a man of Virginia a man of General Lee he meet wiz a Creole of ze troops of Beauregard And ze man of Virginia he talk talk talk how General Lee do zis General Lee say zat And ze Creole he look polite and he wreenkle hees forehead lak he try to remembaire and zen he smile and say General Lee Ah oui Now I know General Lee Ze man General Beauregard speak well of Scarlett tried to join politely in the laughter but she did not see any point to the story except that Creoles were just as stuck up as Charleston and Savannah people Moreover she had always thought Ashleys son should have been named after him The musicians after preliminary tunings and whangings broke into Old Dan Tucker and Tommy turned to her  Page    Gone With The Wind Will you dance Scarlett I cant favor you but Hugh or Ren No thank you Im still mourning my mother said Scarlett hastily I will sit them out Her eyes singled out Frank Kennedy and beckoned him from the side of Mrs Elsing Ill sit in that alcove yonder if youll bring me some refreshments and then we can have a nice chat she told Frank as the other three men moved off When he had hurried away to bring her a glass of wine and a paper thin slice of cake Scarlett sat down in the air cove at the end of the drawing room and carefully arranged her skirts so that the worst spots would not show The humiliating events of the morning with Rhett were pushed from her mind by the excitement of seeing so many people and hearing music again Tomorrow she would think of Rhetts conduct and her shame and they would make her writhe again Tomorrow she would wonder if she had made any impression on Franks hurt and bewildered heart But not tonight Tonight she was alive to her finger tips every sense alert with hope her eyes sparkling She looked from the alcove into the huge drawing room and watched the dancers remembering how beautiful this room had been when first she came to Atlanta during the war Then the hardwood floors had shone like glass and overhead the chandelier with its hundreds of tiny prisms had caught and reflected every ray of the dozens of candles it bore flinging them like gleams from diamonds flame and sapphire about the room The old portraits on the walls had been dignified and gracious and had looked down upon guests with an air of mellowed hospitality The rosewood sofas had been soft and inviting and one of them the largest had stood in the place of honor in this same alcove where she now sat It had been Scarletts favorite seat at parties From this point stretched the pleasant vista of drawing room and dining room beyond the oval mahogany table which seated twenty and the twenty slimlegged chairs demurely against the walls the massive sideboard and buffet weighted with heavy silver with sevenbranched candlesticks goblets cruets decanters and shining little glasses Scarlett had sat on that sofa so often in the first years of the war always with some handsome officer beside her and listened to violin and bull fiddle accordion and banjo and heard the exciting swishing noises which dancing feet made on the waxed and polished floor Now the chandelier hung dark It was twisted askew and most of the prisms were broken as if the Yankee occupants had made their beauty a target for their boots Now an oil lamp and a few candles lighted the room and the roaring fire in the wide hearth gave most of the illumination Its flickering light showed how irreparably scarred and splintered the dull old floor was Squares on the faded paper on the wall gave evidence that once the portraits had hung there and wide cracks in the plaster recalled the day during the siege when a shell had exploded on the house and torn off parts of the roof and second floor The heavy old mahogany table spread with cake and decanters still presided in the emptylooking dining room but it was scratched and the broken legs showed signs of clumsy repair The sideboard the silver and the spindly chairs were gone The dullgold damask draperies which had covered the arching French windows at the back of the room were missing and only the remnants of the lace curtains remained clean but obviously mended In place of the curved sofa she had liked so much was a hard bench that was none too comfortable She sat upon it with as good grace as possible wishing her skirts were in such condition that she could dance It would be so good to dance again But of course she could do more with Frank in this sequestered alcove than in a breathless reel and she could listen fascinated to his talk and encourage him to greater flights of foolishness But the music certainly was inviting Her slipper patted longingly in time with old Levis large splayed foot as he twanged a strident banjo and called the figures of the reel Feet swished and scraped and patted as the twin lines danced toward each other retreated whirled and made arches of their arms  Ole Dan Tucker he got drunk Swing yo padners Fell in de fiah an he kick up a chunk Skip tight ladies After the dull and exhausting months at Tara it was good to hear music again and the sound of dancing feet good to see familiar friendly faces laughing in the feeble light calling old jokes and catchwords bantering rallying coquetting It was like coming to life again after being dead It almost seemed that the bright days of five years ago had come back again If she could close her eyes and not see the worn madeover dresses and the patched boots and mended slippers if her mind did not call up the faces of boys missing from the reel she might almost think that nothing had changed But as she looked watching the old men grouped about the decanter in the dining room the matrons lining the walls talking behind fanless hands and the swaying skipping young dancers it came to her suddenly coldly frighteningly that it was all as greatly changed as if these familiar figures were ghosts They looked the same but they were different What was it Was it only that they were five years older No it was something more than the passing of time Something had gone out of them out of their world Five years ago a feeling of security had wrapped them all around so gently they were not even aware of it In its shelter they had flowered Now it was gone and with it had gone the old thrill the old sense of something delightful and exciting just around the corner the old glamour of their way of living She knew she had changed too but not as they had changed and it puzzled her She sat and watched them and she felt herself an alien among them as alien and lonely as if she had come from another world speaking a language they did not understand and she not understanding theirs Then she knew that this feeling was the same one she felt with Ashley With him and with people of his kindand they made up most of her worldshe felt outside of something she could not understand Their faces were little changed and their manners not at all but it seemed to her that these two things were all that remained of her old friends An ageless dignity a timeless gallantry still clung about them and would cling until they died but they would carry undying bitterness to their graves a bitterness too deep for words They were a softspoken fierce tired people who were defeated and would not know defeat broken yet standing determinedly erect They were crushed and helpless citizens of  Page    Gone With The Wind conquered provinces They were looking on the state they loved seeing it trampled by the enemy rascals making a mock of the law their former slaves a menace their men disfranchised their women insulted And they were remembering graves Everything in their old world had changed but the old forms The old usages went on must go on for the forms were all that were left to them They were holding tightly to the things they knew best and loved best in the old days the leisured manners the courtesy the pleasant casualness in human contacts and most of all the protecting attitude of the men toward their women True to the tradition in which they had been reared the men were courteous and tender and they almost succeeded in creating an atmosphere of sheltering their women from all that was harsh and unfit for feminine eyes That thought Scarlett was the height of absurdity for there was little now which even the most cloistered women had not seen and known in the last five years They had nursed the wounded closed dying eyes suffered war and fire and devastation known terror and flight and starvation But no matter what sights they had seen what menial tasks they had done and would have to do they remained ladies and gentlemen royalty in exilebitter aloof incurious kind to one another diamond hard as bright and brittle as the crystals of the broken chandelier over their heads The old days had gone but these people would go their ways as if the old days still existed charming leisurely determined not to rush and scramble for pennies as the Yankees did determined to part with none of the old ways Scarlett knew that she too was greatly changed Otherwise she could not have done the things she had done since she was last in Atlanta otherwise she would not now be contemplating doing what she desperately hoped to do But there was a difference in their hardness and hers and just what the difference was she could not for the moment tell Perhaps it was that there was nothing she would not do and there were so many things these people would rather die than do Perhaps it was that they were without hope but still smiling at life bowing gracefully and passing it by And this Scarlett could not do She could not ignore life She had to live it and it was too brutal too hostile for her even to try to gloss over its harshness with a smile Of the sweetness and courage and unyielding pride of her friends Scarlett saw nothing She saw only a silly stiffneckedness which observed facts but smiled and refused to look them in the face As she stared at the dancers flushed from the reel she wondered if things drove them as she was driven dead lovers maimed husbands children who were hungry acres slipping away beloved roofs that sheltered strangers But of course they were driven She knew their circumstances only a little less thoroughly than she knew her own Their losses had been her losses their privations her privations their problems her same problems Yet they had reacted differently to them The faces she was seeing in the room were not faces they were masks excellent masks which would never drop But if they were suffering as acutely from brutal circumstances as she wasand they werehow could they this air of gaiety and lightness of heart Why indeed should they even try to do it They were beyond her comprehension and vaguely irritating She couldnt be like them She couldnt survey the wreck of the world with an air of casual unconcern She was as hunted as a fox running with a bursting heart trying to reach a burrow before the hounds caught up Suddenly she hated them all because they were different from her because they carried their losses with an air that she could never attain would never wish to attain She hated them these smiling lightfooted strangers these proud fools who took pride in something they had lost seeming to be proud that they had lost it The women bore themselves like ladies and she knew they were ladies though menial tasks were their daily lot and they didnt know where their next dress was coming from Ladies all But she could not feel herself a lady for all her velvet dress and scented hair for all the pride of birth that stood behind her and the pride of wealth that had once been hers Harsh contact with the red earth of Tara had stripped gentility from her and she knew she would never feel like a lady again until her table was weighted with silver and crystal and smoking with rich food until her own horses and carriages stood in her stables until black hands and not white took the cotton from Tara Ah she thought angrily sucking in her breath Thats the difference Even though theyre poor they still feel like ladies and I dont The silly fools dont seem to realize that you cant be a lady without money Even in this flash of revelation she realized vaguely that foolish though they seemed theirs was the right attitude Ellen would have thought so This disturbed her She knew she should feel as these people felt but she could not She knew she should believe devoutly as they did that a born lady remained a lady even if reduced to poverty but she could not make herself believe it now All her life she had heard sneers hurled at the Yankees because their pretensions to gentility were based on wealth not breeding But at this moment heresy though it was she could not help thinking the Yankees were right on this one matter even if wrong in all others It took money to be a lady She knew Ellen would have fainted had she ever heard such words from her daughter No depth of poverty could ever have made Ellen feel ashamed Ashamed Yet that was how Scarlett felt Ashamed that she was poor and reduced to galling shifts and penury and work that negroes should do She shrugged in irritation Perhaps these people were right and she was wrong but just the same these proud fools werent looking forward as she was doing straining every nerve risking even honor and good name to get back what they had lost It was beneath the dignity of any of them to indulge in a scramble for money The times were rude and hard They called for rude and hard struggle if one was to conquer them Scarlett knew that family tradition would forcibly restrain many of these people from such a strugglewith the making of money admittedly its aim They all thought that obvious moneymaking and even talk of money were vulgar in the extreme Of course there were exceptions Mrs Merriwether and her baking and Ren driving the pie wagon And Hugh Elsing cutting and peddling firewood and Tommy contracting And Frank having the gumption to start a store But what of the rank and file of them The planters would scratch a few acres and live in poverty The lawyers and doctors would go back to their professions and wait for clients who might never come And the rest those who had lived in leisure on their incomes What would happen to them But she wasnt going to be poor all her life She wasnt going to sit down and patiently wait for a miracle to help her She was going to rush into life and wrest from it what she could Her father had started as a poor immigrant boy and had won the broad acres of Tara What he had done his daughter could do She wasnt like these people who had gambled everything on a Cause that was gone and were content to be proud of having lost that Cause because it was worth any sacrifice They drew their courage from the past She was drawing hers from the future Frank Kennedy at present was her future At least he had the store and he had cash money And if she could only marry him and get her hands on that money she could make ends meet at Tara for another  Page    Gone With The Wind year And after thatFrank must buy the sawmill She could see for herself how quickly the town was rebuilding and anyone who could establish a lumber business now when there was so little competition would have a gold mine There came to her from the recesses of her mind words Rhett had spoken in the early years of the war about the money he made in the blockade She had not taken the trouble to understand them then but now they seemed perfectly clear and she wondered if it had been only her youth or plain stupidity which had kept her from appreciating them Theres just as much money to be made in the wreck of a civilization as in the upbuilding of one This is the wreck he foresaw she thought and he was right Theres still plenty of money to be made by anyone who isnt afraid to workor to grab She saw Frank coming across the floor toward her with a glass of blackberry wine in his hand and a morsel of cake on a saucer and she pulled her face into a smile It did not occur to her to question whether Tara was worth marrying Frank She knew it was worth it and she never gave the matter a second thought She smiled up at him as she sipped the wine knowing that her cheeks were more attractively pink than any of the dancers She moved her skirts for him to sit by her and waved her handkerchief idly so that the faint sweet smell of the cologne could reach his nose She was proud of the cologne for no other woman in the room was wearing any and Frank had noticed it In a fit of daring he had whispered to her that she was as pink and fragrant as a rose If only he were not so shy He reminded her of a timid old brown field rabbit If only he had the gallantry and ardor of the Tarleton boys or even the coarse impudence of Rhett Butler But if he possessed those qualities hed probably have sense enough to feel the desperation that lurked just beneath her demurely fluttering eyelids As it was he didnt know enough about women even to suspect what she was up to That was her good fortune but it did not increase her respect for him CHAPTER XXXVI SHE MARRIED Frank Kennedy two weeks later after a whirlwind courtship which she blushingly told him left her too breathless to oppose his ardor any longer He did not know that during those two weeks she had walked the floor at night gritting her teeth at the slowness with which he took hints and encouragements praying that no untimely letter from Suellen would reach him and ruin her plans She thanked God that her sister was the poorest of correspondents delighting to receive letters and disliking to write them But there was always a chance always a chance she thought in the long night hours as she padded back and forth across the cold floor of her bedroom with Ellens faded shawl clutched about her nightdress Frank did not know she had received a laconic letter from Will relating that Jonas Wilkerson had paid another call at Tara and finding her gone to Atlanta had stormed about until Will and Ashley threw him bodily off the place Wills letter hammered into her mind the fact she knew only too wellthat time was getting shorter and shorter before the extra taxes must be paid A fierce desperation drove her as she saw the days slipping by and she wished she might grasp the hourglass in her hands and keep the sands from running But so well did she conceal her feelings so well did she enact her role Frank suspected nothing saw no more than what lay on the surfacethe pretty and helpless young widow of Charles Hamilton who greeted him every night in Miss Pittypats parlor and listened breathless with admiration as he told of future plans for his store and how much money he expected to make when he was able to buy the sawmill Her sweet sympathy and her brighteyed interest in every word he uttered were balm upon the wound left by Suellens supposed defection His heart was sore and bewildered at Suellens conduct and his vanity the shy touchy vanity of a middleaged bachelor who knows himself to be unattractive to women was deeply wounded He could not write Suellen upbraiding her for her faithlessness he shrank from the very idea But he could ease his heart by talking about her to Scarlett Without saying a disloyal word about Suellen she could tell him she understood how badly her sister had treated him and what good treatment he merited from a woman who really appreciated him Little Mrs Hamilton was such a pretty pinkcheeked person alternating between melancholy sighs when she thought of her sad plight and laughter as gay and sweet as the tinkling of tiny silver bells when he made small jokes to cheer her Her green gown now neatly cleaned by Mammy showed off her slender figure with its tiny waist to perfection and how bewitching was the faint fragrance which always clung about her handkerchief and her hair It was a shame that such a fine little woman should be alone and helpless in a world so rough that she didnt even understand its harshness No husband nor brother nor even a father now to protect her Frank thought the world too rude a place for a lone woman and in that idea Scarlett silently and heartily concurred He came to call every night for the atmosphere of Pittys house was pleasant and soothing Mammys smile at the front door was the smile reserved for quality folks Pitty served him coffee laced with brandy and fluttered about him and Scarlett hung on his every utterance Sometimes in the afternoons he took Scarlett riding with him in his buggy when he went out on business These rides were merry affairs because she asked so many foolish questionsjust like a woman he told himself approvingly He couldnt help laughing at her ignorance about business matters and she laughed too saying Well of course you cant expect a silly little woman like me to understand mens affairs She made him feel for the first time in his oldmaidish life that he was a strong upstanding man fashioned by God in a nobler mold than other men fashioned to protect silly helpless women When at last they stood together to be married her confiding little hand in his and her downcast lashes throwing thick black crescents on her pink cheeks he still did not know how it all came about He only knew he had done something romantic and exciting for the first time in his life He Frank Kennedy had swept this lovely creature off her feet and into his strong arms That was a heady feeling No friend or relative stood up with them at their marriage The witnesses were strangers called in from the street Scarlett had insisted on that and he had given in though reluctantly for he would have liked his sister and his brotherinlaw from Jonesboro to be with him And a reception with toasts drunk to the bride in Miss Pittys parlor amid happy friends would have been a joy to him But Scarlett would not hear of even Miss Pitty being present  Page    Gone With The Wind Just us two Frank she begged squeezing his arm Like an elopement I always did want to run away and be married Please sweetheart just for me It was that endearing term still so new to his ears and the bright teardrops which edged her pale green eyes as she looked up pleadingly at him that won him over After all a man had to make some concessions to his bride especially about the wedding for women set such a store by sentimental things And before he knew it he was married Frank gave her the three hundred dollars bewildered by her sweet urgency reluctant at first because it meant the end of his hope of buying the sawmill immediately But he could not see her family evicted and his disappointment soon faded at the sight of her radiant happiness disappeared entirely at the loving way she took on over his generosity Frank had never before had a woman take on over him and he came to feel that the money had been well spent after all Scarlett dispatched Mammy to Tara immediately for the triple purpose of giving Will the money announcing her marriage and bringing Wade to Atlanta In two days she had a brief note from Will which she carried about with her and read and reread with mounting joy Will wrote that the taxes had been paid and Jonas Wilkerson acted up pretty bad at the news but had made no other threats so far Will closed by wishing her happiness a laconic formal statement which he qualified in no way She knew Win understood what she had done and why she had done it and neither blamed nor praised But what must Ashley think she wondered feverishly What must he think of me now after what I said to him so short a while ago in the orchard at Tara She also had a letter from Suellen poorly spelled violent abusive tear splotched a letter so full of venom and truthful observations upon her character that she was never to forget it nor forgive the writer But even Suellens words could not dim her happiness that Tara was safe at least from immediate danger It was hard to realize that Atlanta and not Tara was her permanent home now In her desperation to obtain the tax money no thought save Tara and the fate which threatened it had any place in her mind Even at the moment of marriage she had not given a thought to the fact that the price she was paying for the safety of home was permanent exile from it Now that the deed was done she realized this with a wave of homesickness hard to dispel But there it was She had made her bargain and she intended to stand by it And she was so grateful to Frank for saving Tara she felt a warm affection for him and an equally warm determination that he should never regret marrying her The ladies of Atlanta knew their neighbors business only slightly less completely than they knew their own and were far more interested in it They all knew that for years Frank Kennedy had had an understanding with Suellen OHara In fact he had said sheepishly that he expected to get married in the spring So the tumult of gossip surmise and deep suspicion which followed the announcement of his quiet wedding to Scarlett was not surprising Mrs Merriwether who never let her curiosity go long unsatis fied if she could help it asked him pointblank just what he meant by marrying one sister when he was betrothed to the other She reported to Mrs Elsing that all the answer she got for her pains was a silly look Not even Mrs Merriwether doughty soul that she was dared to approach Scarlett on the subject Scarlett seemed demure and sweet enough these days but there was a pleased complacency in her eyes which annoyed people and she carried a chip on her shoulder which no one cared to disturb She knew Atlanta was talking but she did not care After all there wasnt anything immoral in marrying a man Tare was safe Let people talk She had too many other matters to occupy her mind The most important was how to make Frank realize in a tactful manner that his store should bring in more money After the fright Jonas Wilkerson had given her she would never rest easy until she and Frank had some money ahead And even if no emergency developed Frank would need to make more money if she was going to save enough for next years taxes Moreover what Frank had said about the sawmill stuck in her mind Frank could make lots of money out of a mill Anybody could with lumber selling at such outrageous prices She fretted silently because Franks money had not been enough to pay the taxes on Tara and buy the mill as well And she made up her mind that he had to make more money on the store somehow and do it quickly so he could buy that mill before some one else snapped it up She could see it was a bargain If she were a man she would have that mill if she had to mortgage the store to raise the money But when she intimated this delicately to Frank the day after they married he smiled and told her not to bother her sweet pretty little head about business matters It had come as a surprise to him that she even knew what a mortgage was and at first he was amused But this amusement quickly passed and a sense of shock took its place in the early days of their marriage Once incautiously he had told her that people he was careful not to mention names owed him money but could not pay just now and he was of course unwilling to press old friends and gentlefolk Frank regretted ever mentioning it for thereafter she had questioned him about it again and again She had the most charmingly childlike air but she was just curious she said to know who owed him and how much they owed Frank was very evasive about the matter He coughed nervously and waved his hands and repeated his annoying remark about her sweet pretty little head It had begun to dawn on him that this same sweet pretty little head was a good head for figures In fact a much better one than his own and the knowledge was disquieting He was thunderstruck to discover that she could swiftly add a long column of figures in her head when he needed a pencil and paper for more than three figures And fractions presented no difficulties to her at all He felt there was something unbecoming about a woman understanding fractions and business matters and he believed that should a woman be so unfortunate as to have such unladylike comprehension she should pretend not to Now he disliked talking business with her as much as be had enjoyed it before they were married Then he had thought it all beyond her mental grasp and it had been pleasant to explain things to her Now he saw that she understood entirely too well and he felt the usual masculine indignation at the duplicity of women Added to it was the usual masculine disillusionment in discovering that a woman has a brain Just how early in his married life Frank learned of the deception Scarlett had used in marrying him no one ever knew Perhaps the truth dawned on him when Tony Fontaine obviously fancy free came to Atlanta on business Perhaps it was told him more directly in letters from his sister in Jonesboro who was astounded at his marriage Certainly he never learned from Suellen herself She never wrote him and naturally he could not write her and explain What good would explanations do anyway now that he  Page    Gone With The Wind was married He writhed inwardly at the thought that Suellen would never know the truth and would always think he had senselessly jilted her Probably everyone else was thinking this too and criticizing him It certainly put him in an awkward position And he had no way of clearing himself for a man couldnt go about saying he had lost his head about a womanand a gentleman couldnt advertise the fact that his wife had entrapped him with a lie Scarlett was his wife and a wife was entitled to the loyalty of her husband Furthermore he could not bring himself to believe she had married him coldly and with no affection for him at all His masculine vanity would not permit such a thought to stay long in his mind It was more pleasant to think she had fallen so suddenly in love with him she had been willing to lie to get him But it was all very puzzling He knew he was no great catch for a woman half his age and pretty and smart to boot but Frank was a gentleman and he kept his bewilderment to himself Scarlett was his wife and he could not insult her by asking awkward questions which after all would not remedy matters Not that Frank especially wanted to remedy matters for it appeared that his marriage would be a happy one Scarlett was the most charming and exciting of women and he thought her perfect in all thingsexcept that she was so headstrong Frank learned early in his marriage that so long as she had her own way life could be very pleasant but when she was opposed Given her own way she was as gay as a child laughed a good deal made foolish little jokes sat on his knee and tweaked his beard until he vowed he felt twenty years younger She could be unexpectedly sweet and thoughtful having his slippers toasting at the fire when he came home at night fussing affectionately about his wet feet and interminable head colds remembering that he always liked the gizzard of the chicken and three spoonfuls of sugar in his coffee Yes life was very sweet and cozy with Scarlettas long as she had her own way When the marriage was two weeks old Frank contracted the grippe and Dr Meade put him to bed In the first year of the war Frank had spent two months in the hospital with pneumonia and he had lived in dread of another attack since that time so he was only too glad to lie sweating under three blankets and drink the hot concoctions Mammy and Aunt Pitty brought him every hour The illness dragged on and Frank worried more and more about the store as each day passed The place was in charge of the counter boy who came to the house every night to report on the days transactions but Frank was not satisfied He fretted until Scarlett who had only been waiting for such an opportunity laid a cool hand on his forehead and said Now sweetheart I shall be vexed if you take on so Ill go to town and see how things are And she went smiling as she smothered his feeble protests During the three weeks of her new marriage she had been in a fever to see his account books and find out just how money matters stood What luck that he was bedridden The store stood near Five Points its new roof glaring against the smoked bricks of the old walls Wooden awnings covered the sidewalk to the edge of the street and at the long iron bars connecting the uprights horses and mules were hitched their heads bowed against the cold misty rain their backs covered with torn blankets and quilts The inside of the store was almost like Bullards store in Jonesboro except that there were no loungers about the roaring redhot stove whittling and spitting streams of tobacco juice at the sand boxes It was bigger than Bullards store and much darker The wooden awnings cut off most of the winter daylight and the interior was dim and dingy only a trickle of light coming in through the small flyspecked windows high up on the side walls The floor was covered with muddy sawdust and everywhere was dust and dirt There was a semblance of order in the front of the store where tall shelves rose into the gloom stacked with bright bolts of cloth china cooking utensils and notions But in the back behind the partition chaos reigned Here there was no flooring and the assorted jumble of stock was piled helterskelter on the hardpacked earth In the semidarkness she saw boxes and bales of goods plows and harness and saddles and cheap pine coffins Secondhand furniture ranging from cheap gum to mahogany and rosewood reared up in the gloom and the rich but worn brocade and horsehair upholstery gleamed incongruously in the dingy surroundings China chambers and bowl and pitcher sets littered the floor and all around the four walls were deep bins so dark she had to hold the lamp directly over them to discover they contained seeds nails bolts and carpenters tools Id think a man as fussy and old maidish as Frank would keep things tidier she thought scrubbing her grimy hands with her handkerchief This place is a pig pen What a way to run a store If hed only dust up this stuff and put it out in front where folks could see it he could sell things much quicker And if his stock was in such condition what mustnt his accounts be Ill look at his account book now she thought and picking up the lamp she went into the front of the store Willie the counter boy was reluctant to give her the large dirtybacked ledger It was obvious that young as he was he shared Franks opinion that women had no place in business But Scarlett silenced him with a sharp word and sent him out to get his dinner She felt better when he was gone for his disapproval annoyed her and she settled herself in a splitbottomed chair by the roaring stove tucked one foot under her and spread the book across her lap It was dinner time and the streets were deserted No customers called and she had the store to herself She turned the pages slowly narrowly scanning the rows of names and figures written in Franks cramped copperplate hand It was just as she had expected and she frowned as she saw this newest evidence of Franks lack of business sense At least five hundred dollars in debts some of them months old were set down against the names of people she knew well the Merriwethers and the Elsings among other familiar names From Franks deprecatory remarks about the money people owed him she had imagined the sums to be small But this If they cant pay why do they keep on buying she thought irritably And if he knows they cant pay why does he keep on selling them stuff Lots of them could pay if hed just make them do it The Elsings certainly could if they could give Fanny a new satin dress and an expensive wedding Franks just too soft hearted and people take advantage of him Why if hed collected half this money he could have bought the sawmill and easily spared me the tax money too Then she thought Just imagine Frank trying to operate a sawmill Gods nightgown If he runs this store like a charitable institution how could he expect to make money on a mill The sheriff would have it in a month Why I could run this store better than he does And I could run a mill better than he could even if I dont know anything about the lumber business  Page    Gone With The Wind A startling thought this that a woman could handle business matters as well as or better than a man a revolutionary thought to Scarlett who had been reared in the tradition that men were omniscient and women none too bright Of course she had discovered that this was not altogether true but the pleasant fiction still stuck in her mind Never before had she put this remarkable idea into words She sat quite still with the heavy book across her lap her mouth a little open with surprise thinking that during the lean months at Tara she had done a mans work and done it well She had been brought up to believe that a woman alone could accomplish nothing yet she had managed the plantation without men to help her until Will came Why why her mind stuttered I believe women could manage everything in the world without mens helpexcept having babies and God knows no woman in her right mind would have babies if she could help it With the idea that she was as capable as a man came a sudden rush of pride and a violent longing to prove it to make money for herself as men made money Money which would be her own which she would neither have to ask for nor account for to any man I wish I had money enough to buy that mill myself she said aloud and sighed Id sure make it hum And I wouldnt let even one splinter go out on credit She sighed again There was nowhere she could get any money so the idea was out of the question Frank would simply have to collect this money owing him and buy the mill It was a sure way to make money and when he got the mill she would certainly find some way to make him be more businesslike in its operation than he had been with the store She pulled a back page out of the ledger and began copying the list of debtors who had made no payments in several months Shed take the matter up with Frank just as soon as she reached home Shed make him realize that these people had to pay their bills even if they were old friends even if it did embarrass him to press them for money That would probably upset Frank for he was timid and fond of the approbation of his friends He was so thin skinned hed rather lose the money than be businesslike about collecting it And hed probably tell her that no one had any money with which to pay him Well perhaps that was true Poverty was certainly no news to her But nearly everybody had saved some silver or jewelry or was hanging on to a little real estate Frank could take them in lieu of cash She could imagine how Frank would moan when she broached such an idea to him Take the jewelry and property of his friends Well she shrugged he can moan all he likes Im going to tell him that he may be willing to stay poor for friendships sake but Im not Frank will never get anywhere if he doesnt get up some gumption And hes got to get somewhere Hes got to make money even if Ive got to wear the pants in the family to make him do it She was writing busily her face screwed up with the effort her tongue clamped between her teeth when the front door opened and a great draft of cold wind swept the store A tall man came into the dingy room walking with a light Indianlike tread and looking up she saw Rhett Butler He was resplendent in new clothes and a greatcoat with a dashing cape thrown back from his heavy shoulders His tall hat was off in a deep bow when her eyes met his and his hand went to the bosom of a spotless pleated shirt His white teeth gleamed startlingly against his brown face and his bold eyes raked her My dear Mrs Kennedy he said walking toward her My very dear Mrs Kennedy and he broke into a loud merry laugh At first she was as startled as if a ghost had invaded the store and then hastily removing her foot from beneath her she stiffened her spine and gave him a cold stare What are you doing here I called on Miss Pittypat and learned of your marriage and so I hastened here to congratulate you The memory of her humiliation at his hands made her go crimson with shame I dont see how you have the gall to face me she cried On the contrary How have you the gall to face me Oh you are the most Shall we let the bugles sing truce he smiled down at her a wide flashing smile that had impudence in it but no shame for his own actions or condemnation for hers In spite of herself she had to smile too but it was a wry uncomfortable smile What a pity they didnt hang you Others share your feeling I fear Come Scarlett relax You look like youd swallowed a ramrod and it isnt becoming Surely youve had time to recover from myermy little joke Joke Ha Ill never get over it Oh yes you will You are just putting on this indignant front because you think its proper and respectable May I sit down No He sank into a chair beside her and grinned I hear you couldnt even wait two weeks for me he said and gave a mock sigh How fickle is woman When she did not reply he continued Tell me Scarlett just between friendsbetween very old and very intimate friendswouldnt it have been wiser to wait until I got out of jail Or are the charms of wedlock with old Frank Kennedy more alluring than illicit relations with me As always when his mockery aroused wrath within her wrath fought with laughter at his impudence Dont be absurd And would you mind satisfying my curiosity on one point which has bothered me for some time Did you have no womanly repugnance no delicate shrinking from marrying not just one man but two for whom you had no love or even affection Or have I been misinformed about the delicacy of our Southern womanhood Rhett I have my answer I always felt that women had a hardness and endurance unknown to men despite the pretty idea taught me in childhood that women are frail tender sensitive creatures But after all according to the Continental code of etiquette its very bad form for husband and wife to love each other Very bad taste indeed I always felt that the Europeans had the right idea  Page    Gone With The Wind in that matter Marry for convenience and love for pleasure A sensible system dont you think You are closer to the old country than I thought How pleasant it would be to shout at him I did not marry for convenience But unfortunately Rhett had her there and any protest of injured innocence would only bring more barbed remarks from him How you do run on she said coolly Anxious to change the subject she asked How did you ever get out of jail Oh that he answered making an airy gesture Not much trouble They let me out this morning I employed a delicate system of blackmail on a friend in Washington who is quite high in the councils of the Federal government A splendid fellowone of the staunch Union patriots from whom I used to buy muskets and hoop skirts for the Confederacy When my distressing predicament was brought to his attention in the right way he hastened to use his influence and so I was released Influence is everything and guilt or innocence merely an academic question Ill take oath you werent innocent No now that I am free of the toils Ill frankly admit that Im as guilty as Cain I did kill the nigger He was uppity to a lady and what else could a Southern gentleman do And while Im confessing I must admit that I shot a Yankee cavalryman after some words in a barroom I was not charged with that peccadillo so perhaps some other poor devil has been hanged for it long since He was so blithe about his murders her blood chilled Words of moral indignation rose to her lips but suddenly she remembered the Yankee who lay under the tangle of scuppernong vines at Tara He had not been on her conscience any more than a roach upon which she might have stepped She could not sit in judgment on Rhett when she was as guilty as he And as I seem to be making a clean breast of it I must tell you in strictest confidence that means dont tell Miss Pittypat that I did have the money safe in a bank in Liverpool The money Yes the money the Yankees were so curious about Scarlett it wasnt altogether meanness that kept me from giving you the money you wanted If Id drawn a draft they could have traced it somehow and I doubt if youd have gotten a cent My only hope lay in doing nothing I knew the money was pretty safe for if worst came to worst if they had located it and tried to take it away from me I would have named every Yankee patriot who sold me bullets and machinery during the war Then there would have been a stink for some of them are high up in Washington now In fact it was my threat to unbosom my conscience about them that got me out of jail I Do you mean youyou actually have the Confederate gold Not all of it Good Heavens no There must be fifty or more exblockaders who have plenty salted away in Nassau and England and Canada We will be pretty unpopular with the Confederates who werent as slick as we were I have got close to half a million Just think Scarlett a halfmillion dollars if youd only restrained your fiery nature and not rushed into wedlock again A halfmillion dollars She felt a pang of almost physical sickness at the thought of so much money His jeering words passed over her head and she did not even hear them It was hard to believe there was so much money in all this bitter and povertystricken world So much money so very much money and someone else had it someone who took it lightly and didnt need it And she had only a sick elderly husband and this dirty piddling little store between her and a hostile world It wasnt fair that a reprobate like Rhett Butler should have so much and she who carried so heavy a load should have so little She hated him sitting there in his dandified attire taunting her Well she wouldnt swell his conceit by complimenting him on his cleverness She longed viciously for sharp words with which to cut him I suppose you think its honest to keep the Confederate money Well it isnt Its plain out and out stealing and you know it I wouldnt have that on my conscience My How sour the grapes are today he exclaimed screwing up his face And just whom am I stealing from She was silent trying to think just whom indeed After all he had only done what Frank had done on a small scale Half the money is honestly mine he continued honestly made with the aid of honest Union patriots who were willing to sell out the Union behind its backfor onehundredpercent profit on their goods Part I made out of my little investment in cotton at the beginning of the war the cotton I bought cheap and sold for a dollar a pound when the British mills were crying for it Part I got from food speculation Why should I let the Yankees have the fruits of my labor But the rest did belong to the Confederacy It came from Confederate cotton which I managed to run through the blockade and sell in Liverpool at skyhigh prices The cotton was given me in good faith to buy leather and rifles and machinery with And it was taken by me in good faith to buy the same My orders were to leave the gold in English banks under my own name in order that my credit would be good You remember when the blockade tightened I couldnt get a boat out of any Confederate port or into one so there the money stayed in England What should I have done Drawn out all that gold from English banks like a simpleton and tried to run it into Wilmington And let the Yankees capture it Was it my fault that the blockade got too tight Was it my fault that our Cause failed The money belonged to the Confederacy Well there is no Confederacy nowthough youd never know it to hear some people talk Whom shall I give the money to The Yankee government I should so hate for people to think me a thief He removed a leather case from his pocket extracted a long cigar and smelled it approvingly meanwhile watching her with pseudo anxiety as if he hung on her words Plague take him she thought hes always one jump ahead of me There is always something wrong with his arguments but I never can put my finger on just what it is You might she said with dignity distribute it to those who are in need The Confederacy is gone but there are plenty of Confederates and their families who are starving He threw back his head and laughed rudely You are never so charming or so absurd as when you are airing some hypocrisy like that he cried in frank enjoyment Always tell the truth Scarlett You cant lie The Irish are the poorest liars in the world Come now be frank You never gave a damn about the late lamented Confederacy and you care less about the starving Confederates Youd scream in protest if I even  Page    Gone With The Wind suggested giving away all the money unless I started off by giving you the lions share I dont want your money she began trying to be coldly dignified Oh dont you Your palm is itching to beat the band this minute If I showed you a quarter youd leap on it If you have come here to insult me and laugh at my poverty I will wish you good day she retorted trying to rid her lap of the heavy ledger so she might rise and make her words more impressive Instantly he was on his feet bending over her laughing as he pushed her back into her chair When will you ever get over losing your temper when you hear the truth You never mind speaking the truth about other people so why should you mind hearing it about yourself Im not insulting you I think acquisitiveness is a very fine quality She was not sure what acquisitiveness meant but as he praised it she felt slightly mollified I didnt come to gloat over your poverty but to wish you long life and happiness in your marriage By the way what did sister Sue think of your larceny My what Your stealing Frank from under her nose I did not Well we wont quibble about the word What did she say She said nothing said Scarlett His eyes danced as they gave her the lie How unselfish of her Now lets hear about your poverty Surely I have the right to know after your little trip out to the jail not long ago Hasnt Frank as much money as you hoped There was no evading his impudence Either she would have to put up with it or ask him to leave And now she did not want him to leave His words were barbed but they were the barbs of truth He knew what she had done and why she had done it and he did not seem to think the less of her for it And though his questions were unpleasantly blunt they seemed actuated by a friendly interest He was one person to whom she could tell the truth That would be a relief for it had been so long since she had told anyone the truth about herself and her motives Whenever she spoke her mind everyone seemed to be shocked Talking to Rhett was comparable only to one thing the feeling of ease and comfort afforded by a pair of old slippers after dancing in a pair too tight Didnt you get the money for the taxes Dont tell me the wolf is still at the door of Tara There was a different tone in his voice She looked up to meet his dark eyes and caught an expression which startled and puzzled her at first and then made her suddenly smile a sweet and charming smile which was seldom on her face these days What a perverse wretch he was but how nice he could be at times She knew now that the real reason for his call was not to tease her but to make sure she had gotten the money for which she had been so desperate She knew now that he had hurried to her as soon as he was released without the slightest appearance of hurry to tend her the money if she still needed it And yet he would torment and insult her and deny that such was his intent should she accuse him He was quite beyond all comprehension Did he really care about her more than he was willing to admit Or did he have some other motive Probably the latter she thought But who could tell He did such strange things sometimes No she said the wolf isnt at the door any longer II got the money But not without a struggle Ill warrant Did you manage to restrain yourself until you got the wedding ring on your finger She tried not to smile at his accurate summing up of her conduct but she could not help dimpling He seated himself again sprawling his long legs comfortably Well tell me about your poverty Did Frank the brute mislead you about his prospects He should be soundly thrashed for taking advantage of a helpless female Come Scarlett tell me everything You should have no secrets from me Surely I know the worst about you Oh Rhett youre the worstwell I dont know what No he didnt exactly fool me but Suddenly it became a pleasure to unburden herself Rhett if Frank would just collect the money people owe him I wouldnt be worried about anything But Rhett fifty people owe him and he wont press them Hes so thin skinned He says a gentleman cant do that to another gentleman And it may be months and may be never before we get the money Well what of it Havent you enough to eat on until he does collect Yes butwell as a matter of fact I could use a little money right now Her eyes brightened as she thought of the mill Perhaps What for More taxes Is that any of your business Yes because you are getting ready to touch me for a loan Oh I know all the approaches And Ill lend it to youwithout my dear Mrs Kennedy that charming collateral you offered me a short while ago Unless of course you insist You are the coarsest Not at all I merely wanted to set your mind at ease I knew youd be worried about that point Not much worried but a little And Im willing to lend you the money But I do want to know how you are going to spend it I have that right I believe If its to buy you pretty frocks or a carriage take it with my blessing But if its to buy a new pair of breeches for Ashley Wilkes I fear I must decline to lend it She was hot with sudden rage and she stuttered until words came Ashley Wilkes has never taken a cent from me I couldnt make him take a cent if he were starving You dont understand him how honorable how proud he is Of course you cant understand him being what you are Dont lets begin calling names I could call you a few that would match any you could think of for me You forget that I have been keeping up with you through Miss Pittypat and the dear soul tells all she knows to any sympathetic listener I know that Ashley has been at Tara ever since he came home from Rock Island I know that you have even put up with having his wife around which must have been a strain on you  Page    Gone With The Wind Ashley is Oh yes he said waving his hand negligently Ashley is too sublime for my earthy comprehension But please dont forget I was an interested witness to your tender scene with him at Twelve Oaks and something tells me he hasnt changed since then And neither have you He didnt cut so sublime a figure that day if I remember rightly And I dont think the figure he cuts now is much better Why doesnt he take his family and get out and find work And stop living at Tara Of course its just a whim of mine but I dont intend to tend you a cent for Tara to help support him Among men theres a very unpleasant name for men who permit women to support them How dare you say such things Hes been working like a field hand For all her rage her heart was wrung by the memory of Ashley splitting fence rails And worth his weight in gold I dare say What a hand he must be with the manure and Hes Oh yes I know Lets grant that he does the best he can but I dont imagine hes much help Youll never make a farm hand out of a Wilkesor anything else thats useful The breed is purely ornamental Now quiet your ruffled feathers and overlook my boorish remarks about the proud and honorable Ashley Strange how these illusions will persist even in women as hard headed as you are How much money do you want and what do you want it for When she did not answer he repeated What do you want it for And see if you can manage to tell me the truth It will do as well as a lie In fact better for if you lie to me Ill be sure to find it out and think how embarrassing that would be Always remember this Scarlett I can stand anything from you but a lieyour dislike for me your tempers all your vixenish ways but not a lie Now what do you want it for Raging as she was at his attack on Ashley she would have given anything to spit on him and throw his offer of money proudly into his mocking face For a moment she almost did but the cold hand of common sense held her back She swallowed her anger with poor grace and tried to assume an expression of pleasant dignity He leaned back in his chair stretching his legs toward the stove If theres one thing in the world that gives me more amusement than anything else he remarked its the sight of your mental struggles when a matter of principle is laid up against something practical like money Of course I know the practical in you will always win but I keep hanging around to see if your better nature wont triumph some day And when that day comes I shall pack my bag and leave Atlanta forever There are too many women whose better natures are always triumphing  Well lets get back to business How much and what for I dont know quite how much Ill need she said sulkily But I want to buy a sawmilland I think I can get it cheap And Ill need two wagons and two mules I want good mules too And a horse and buggy for my own use A sawmill Yes and if youll lend me the money Ill give you a halfinterest in it Whatever would I do with a sawmill Make money We can make loads of money Or Ill pay you interest on the loanlets see what is good interest Fifty per cent is considered very fine Fiftyoh but you are joking Stop laughing you devil Im serious Thats why Im laughing I wonder if anyone but me realizes what goes on in that head back of your deceptively sweet face Well who cares Listen Rhett and see if this doesnt sound like good business to you Frank told me about this man who has a sawmill a little one out Peachtree road and be wants to sell it Hes got to have cash money pretty quick and hell sell it cheap There arent many sawmills around here now and the way people are rebuildingwhy we could sell lumber sky high The man will stay and run the mill for a wage Frank told me about it Frank would buy the mill himself if he had the money I guess he was intending buying it with the money he gave me for the taxes Poor Frank What is he going to say when you tell him youve bought it yourself right out from under him And how are you going to explain my lending you the money without compromising your reputation Scarlett had given no thought to this so intent was she upon the money the mill would bring in Well I just wont tell him Hell know you didnt pick it off a bush Ill tell himwhy yes Ill tell him I sold you my diamond earbobs And I will give them to you too Thatll be my collatmy whatchucallit I wouldnt take your earbobs I dont want them I dont like them They arent really mine anyway Whose are they Her mind went swiftly back to the still hot noon with the country hush deep about Tara and the dead man in blue sprawled in the hall They were left with meby someone whos dead Theyre mine all right Take them I dont want them Id rather have the money for them Good Lord he cried impatiently Dont you ever think of anything but money No she replied frankly turning hard green eyes upon him And if youd been through what I have you wouldnt either Ive found out that money is the most important thing in the world and as God is my witness I dont ever intend to be without it again She remembered the hot sun the soft red earth under her sick head the niggery smell of the cabin behind the ruins of Twelve Oaks remembered the refrain her heart had beaten Ill never be hungry again Ill never be hungry again Im going to have money some day lots of it so I can have anything I want to eat And then therell never be any hominy or dried peas on my table And Im going to have pretty clothes and all of them are going to be silk All  Page    Gone With The Wind All she said shortly not even troubling to blush at his implication Im going to have money enough so the Yankees can never take Tara away from me And Im going to have a new roof for Tara and a new barn and fine mules for plowing and more cotton than you ever saw And Wade isnt ever going to know what it means to do without the things he needs Never Hes going to have everything in the world And all my family they arent ever going to be hungry again I mean it Every word You dont understand youre such a selfish hound Youve never had the Carpetbaggers trying to drive you out Youve never been cold and ragged and had to break your back to keep from starving He said quietly I was in the Confederate Army for eight months I dont know any better place for starving The army Bah Youve never had to pick cotton and weed corn Youve Dont you laugh at me His hands were on hers again as her voice rose harshly I wasnt laughing at you I was laughing at the difference in what you look and what you really are And I was remembering the first time I ever saw you at the barbecue at the Wilkes You had on a green dress and little green slippers and you were knee deep in men and quite full of yourself Ill wager you didnt know then how many pennies were in a dollar There was only one idea in your whole mind then and that was ensnaring Ash She jerked her hands away from him Rhett if we are to get on at all youll have to stop talking about Ashley Wilkes Well always fall out about him because you cant understand him I suppose you understand him like a book said Rhett maliciously No Scarlett if I am to lend you the money I reserve the right to discuss Ashley Wilkes in any terms I care to I waive the right to collect interest on my loan but not that right And there are a number of things about that young man Id like to know I do not have to discuss him with you she answered shortly Oh but you do I hold the purse strings you see Some day when you are rich you can have the power to do the same to others  Its obvious that you still care about him I do not Oh its so obvious from the way you rush to his defense You I wont stand having my friends sneered at Well well let that pass for the moment Does he still care for you or did Rock Island make him forget Or perhaps hes learned to appreciate what a jewel of a wife he has At the mention of Melanie Scarlett began to breathe hard and could scarcely restrain herself from crying out the whole story that only honor kept Ashley with Melanie She opened her mouth to speak and then closed it Oh So he still hasnt enough sense to appreciate Mrs Wilkes And the rigors of prison didnt dim his ardor for you I see no need to discuss the subject I wish to discuss it said Rhett There was a low note in his voice which Scarlett did not understand but did not like to hear And by God I will discuss it and I expect you to answer me So hes still in love with you Well what if he is cried Scarlett goaded I dont care to discuss him with you because you cant understand him or his kind of love The only kind of love you know about is justwell the kind you carry on with creatures like that Watling woman Oh said Rhett softly So I am only capable of carnal lusts Well you know its true Now I appreciate your hesitance in discussing the matter with me My unclean hands and lips besmirch the purity of his love Well yessomething like that Im interested in this pure love Dont be so nasty Rhett Butler If you are vile enough to think theres ever been anything wrong between us Oh the thought never entered my head really Thats why it all interests me Just why hasnt there been anything wrong between you If you think that Ashley would Ah so its Ashley and not you who has fought the fight for purity Really Scarlett you should not give yourself away so easily Scarlett looked into his smooth unreadable face in confusion and indignation We wont go any further with this and I dont want your money So get out Oh yes you do want my money and as weve gone this far why stop Surely there can be no harm in discussing so chaste an idyllwhen there hasnt been anything wrong So Ashley loves you for your mind your soul your nobility of character Scarlett writhed at his words Of course Ashley loved her for just these things It was this knowledge that made life endurable this knowledge that Ashley bound by honor loved her from afar for beautiful things deep buried in her that he alone could see But they did not seem so beautiful when dragged to the light by Rhett especially in that deceptively smooth voice that covered sarcasm It gives me back my boyish ideals to know that such a love can exist in this naughty world he continued So theres no touch of the flesh in his love for you It would be the same if you were ugly and didnt have that white skin And if you didnt have those green eyes which make a man wonder just what you would do if he took you in his arms And a way of swaying your hips thats an allurement to any man under ninety And those lips which arewell I mustnt let my carnal lusts obtrude Ashley sees none of these things Or if he sees them they move him not at all Unbidden Scarletts mind went back to that day in the orchard when Ashleys arms shook as he held her when his mouth was hot on hers as if he would never let her go She went crimson at the memory and her blush was not lost on Rhett So he said and there was a vibrant note almost like anger in his voice I see He loves you for your mind alone How dare he pry with dirty fingers making the one beautiful sacred thing in her life seem vile Coolly determinedly he was breaking down the last of her reserves and the information he wanted was forthcoming Yes he does she cried pushing back the memory of Ashleys lips  Page    Gone With The Wind My dear he doesnt even know youve got a mind If it was your mind that attracted him he would not need to struggle against you as he must have done to keep this love soshall we say holy He could rest easily for after all a man can admire a womans mind and soul and still be an honorable gentleman and true to his wife But it must be difficult for him to reconcile the honor of the Wilkeses with coveting your body as he does You judge everybodys mind by your own vile one Oh Ive never denied coveting you if thats what you mean But thank God Im not bothered about matters of honor What I want I take if I can get it and so I wrestle neither with angels nor devils What a merry hell you must have made for Ashley Almost I can be sorry for him II make a hell for him Yes you There you are a constant temptation to him but like most of his breed he prefers what passes in these parts as honor to any amount of love And it looks to me as if the poor devil now had neither love nor honor to warm himself He has love  I mean he loves me Does he Then answer me this and we are through for the day and you can take the money and throw it in the gutter for all I care Rhett rose to his feet and threw his halfsmoked cigar into the spittoon There was about his movements the same pagan freedom and leashed power Scarlett had noted that night Atlanta fell something sinister and a little frightening If he loved you then why in hell did he permit you to come to Atlanta to get the tax money Before Id let a woman I loved do that Id He didnt know He had no idea that I Doesnt it occur to you that he should have known There was barely suppressed savagery in his voice Loving you as you say he does he should have known just what you would do when you were desperate He should have killed you rather than let you come up hereand to me of all people God in Heaven But he didnt know If he didnt guess it without being told hell never know anything about you and your precious mind How unfair he was As if Ashley was a mind reader As if Ashley could have stopped her even had he known But she knew suddenly Ashley could have stopped her The faintest intimation from him in the orchard that some day things might be different and she would never have thought of going to Rhett A word of tenderness even a parting caress when she was getting on the train would have held her back But he had only talked of honor Yetwas Rhett right Should Ashley have known her mind Swiftly she put the disloyal thought from her Of course he didnt suspect Ashley would never suspect that she would even think of doing anything so immoral Ashley was too fine to have such thoughts Rhett was just trying to spoil her love He was trying to tear down what was most precious to her Some day she thought viciously when the store was on its feet and the mill doing nicely and she had money she would make Rhett Butler pay for the misery and humiliation he was causing her He was standing over her looking down at her faintly amused The emotion which had stirred him was gone What does it all matter to you anyway she asked Its my business and Ashleys and not yours He shrugged Only this I have a deep and impersonal admiration for your endurance Scarlett and I do not like to see your spirit crushed beneath too many millstones Theres Tara Thats a mansized job in itself Theres your sick father added on Hell never be any help to you And the girls and the darkies And now youve taken on a husband and probably Miss Pittypat too Youve enough burdens without Ashley Wilkes and his family on your hands Hes not on my hands He helps Oh for Gods sake he said impatiently Dont lets have any more of that Hes no help Hes on your hands and hell be on them or on somebodys till he dies Personally Im sick of him as a topic of conversation  How much money do you want Vituperative words rushed to her lips After all his insults after dragging from her those things which were most precious to her and trampling on them he still thought she would take his money But the words were checked unspoken How wonderful it would be to scorn his offer and order him out of the store But only the truly rich and the truly secure could afford this luxury So long as she was poor just so long would she have to endure such scenes as this But when she was richoh what a beautiful warming thought that waswhen she was rich she wouldnt stand anything she didnt like do without anything she desired or even be polite to people unless they pleased her I shall tell them all to go to Halifax she thought and Rhett Butler will be the first one The pleasure in the thought brought a sparkle into her green eyes and a halfsmile to her lips Rhett smiled too Youre a pretty person Scarlett he said Especially when you are meditating devilment And just for the sight of that dimple Ill buy you a bakers dozen of mules if you want them The front door opened and the counter boy entered picking his teeth with a quill Scarlett rose pulled her shawl about her and tied her bonnet strings firmly under her chin Her mind was made up Are you busy this afternoon Can you come with me now she asked Where I want you to drive to the mill with me I promised Frank I wouldnt drive out of town by myself To the mill in this rain Yes I want to buy that mill now before you change your mind He laughed so loudly the boy behind the counter started and looked at him curiously Have you forgotten you are married Mrs Kennedy cant afford to be seen driving out into the country with that Butler reprobate who isnt received in the best parlors Have you forgotten your reputation Reputation fiddledeedee I want that mill before you change your mind or Frank finds out that Im buying it Dont be a slow poke Rhett Whats a little rain Lets hurry That sawmill Frank groaned every time he thought of it cursing himself for ever mentioning it to her It was bad enough for  Page    Gone With The Wind her to sell her earrings to Captain Butler of all people and buy the mill without even consulting her own husband about it but it was worse still that she did not turn it over to him to operate That looked bad As if she did not trust him or his judgment Frank in common with all men he knew felt that a wife should be guided by her husbands superior knowledge should accept his opinions in full and have none of her own He would have given most women their own way Women were such funny little creatures and it never hurt to humor their small whims Mild and gentle by nature it was not in him to deny a wife much He would have enjoyed gratifying the foolish notions of some soft little person and scolding her lovingly for her stupidity and extravagance But the things Scarlett set her mind on were unthinkable That sawmill for example It was the shock of his life when she told him with a sweet smile in answer to his questions that she intended to run it herself Go into the lumber business myself was the way she put it Frank would never forget the horror of that moment Go into business for herself It was unthinkable There were no women in business in Atlanta In fact Frank had never heard of a woman in business anywhere If women were so unfortunate as to be compelled to make a little money to assist their families in these hard times they made it in quiet womanly waysbaking as Mrs Merriwether was doing or painting china and sewing and keeping boarders like Mrs Elsing and Fanny or teaching school like Mrs Meade or giving music lessons like Mrs Bonnell These ladies made money but they kept themselves at home while they did it as a woman should But for a woman to leave the protection of her home and venture out into the rough world of men competing with them in business rubbing shoulders with them being exposed to insult and gossip  Especially when she wasnt forced to do it when she had a husband amply able to provide for her Frank had hoped she was only teasing or playing a joke on him a joke of questionable taste but he soon found she meant what she said She did operate the sawmill She rose earlier than he did to drive out Peachtree road and frequently did not come home until long after he had locked up the store and returned to Aunt Pittys for supper She drove the long miles to the mill with only the disapproving Uncle Peter to protect her and the woods were full of free niggers and Yankee riffraff Frank couldnt go with her the store took all of his time but when he protested she said shortly If I dont keep an eye on that slick scamp Johnson hell steal my lumber and sell it and put the money in his pocket When I can get a good man to run the mill for me then I wont have to go out there so often Then I can spend my time in town selling lumber Selling lumber in town That was worst of all She frequently did take a day off from the mill and peddle lumber and on those days Frank wished he could hide in the dark back room of his store and see no one His wife selling lumber And people were talking terrible about her Probably about him too for permitting her to behave in so unwomanly a fashion It embarrassed him to face his customers over the counter and hear them say I saw Mrs Kennedy a few minutes ago over at  Everyone took pains to tell him what she did Everyone was talking about what happened over where the new hotel was being built Scarlett had driven up just as Tommy Wellburn was buying some lumber from another man and she climbed down out of the buggy among the rough Irish masons who were laying the foundations and told Tommy briefly that he was being cheated She said her lumber was better and cheaper too and to prove it she ran up a long column of figures in her head and gave him an estimate then and there It was bad enough that she had intruded herself among strange rough workmen but it was still worse for a woman to show publicly that she could do mathematics like that When Tommy accepted her estimate and gave her the order Scarlett had not taken her departure speedily and meekly but had idled about talking to Johnnie Gallegher the foreman of the Irish workers a hardbitten little gnome of a man who had a very bad reputation The town talked about it for weeks On top of everything else she was actually making money out of the mill and no man could feel right about a wife who succeeded in so unwomanly an activity Nor did she turn over the money or any part of it to him to use in the store Most of it went to Tara and she wrote interminable letters to Will Benteen telling him just how it should be spent Furthermore she told Frank that if the repairs at Tara could ever be completed she intended to lend out her money on mortgages My My moaned Frank whenever he thought of this A woman had no business even knowing what a mortgage was Scarlett was full of plans these days and each one of them seemed worse to Frank than the previous one She even talked of building a saloon on the property where her warehouse had been until Sherman burned it Frank was no teetotaler but he feverishly protested against the idea Owning saloon property was a bad business an unlucky business almost as bad as renting to a house of prostitution Just why it was bad he could not explain to her and to his lame arguments she said Fiddledeedee Saloons are always good tenants Uncle Henry said so she told him They always pay their rent and look here Frank I could put up a cheap saloon out of poorgrade lumber I cant sell and get good rent for it and with the rent money and the money from the mill and what I could get from mortgages I could buy some more sawmills Sugar you dont need any more sawmills cried Frank appalled What you ought to do is sell the one youve got Its wearing you out and you know what trouble you have keeping free darkies at work there Free darkies are certainly worthless Scarlett agreed completely ignoring his hint that she should sell Mr Johnson says he never knows when he comes to work in the morning whether hell have a full crew or not You just cant depend on the darkies any more They work a day or two and then lay off till theyve spent their wages and the whole crew is like as not to quit overnight The more I see of emancipation the more criminal I think it is Its just ruined the darkies Thousands of them arent working at all and the ones we can get to work at the mill are so lazy and shiftless they arent worth having And if you so much as swear at them much less hit them a few licks for the good of their souls the Freedmens Bureau is down on you like a duck on a June bug Sugar you arent letting Mr Johnson beat those Of course not she returned impatiently Didnt I just say the Yankees would put me in jail if I did Ill bet your pa never hit a darky a lick in his life said Frank Well only one A stable boy who didnt rub down his horse after a days hunt But Frank it was different then Free issue niggers are something else and a good whipping would do some of them a lot of good Frank was not only amazed at his wifes views and her plans but at the change which had come over her in the few months since their marriage This wasnt the soft sweet feminine person he had taken to wife In the brief period of the courtship he thought he had never known a woman more attractively feminine in her reactions to life ignorant timid and helpless Now her  Page    Gone With The Wind reactions were all masculine Despite her pink cheeks and dimples and pretty smiles she talked and acted like a man Her voice was brisk and decisive and she made up her mind instantly and with no girlish shillyshallying She knew what she wanted and she went after it by the shortest route like a man not by the hidden and circuitous routes peculiar to women It was not that Frank had never seen commanding women before this Atlanta like all Southern towns had its share of dowagers whom no one cared to cross No one could be more dominating than stout Mrs Merriwether more imperious than frail Mrs Elsing more artful in securing her own ends than the silverhaired sweetvoiced Mrs Whiting But no matter what devices these ladies employed in order to get their own way they were always feminine devices They made a point of being deferential to mens opinions whether they were guided by them or not They had the politeness to appear to be guided by what men said and that was what mattered But Scarlett was guided by no one but herself and was conducting her affairs in a masculine way which had the whole town talking about her And thought Frank miserably probably talking about me too for letting her act so unwomanly Then there was that Butler man His frequent calls at Aunt Pittys house were the greatest humiliation of all Frank had always disliked him even when he had done business with him before the war He often cursed the day he had brought Rhett to Twelve Oaks and introduced him to his friends He despised him for the coldblooded way he had acted in his speculations during the war and for the fact that he had not been in the army Rhetts eight months service with the Confederacy was known only to Scarlett for Rhett had begged her with mock fear not to reveal his shame to anyone Most of all Frank had contempt for him for holding on to the Confederate gold when honest men like Admiral Bulloch and others confronted with the same situation had turned back thousands to the Federal treasury But whether Frank liked it or not Rhett was a frequent caller Ostensibly it was Miss Pitty he came to see and she had no better sense than to believe it and give herself airs over his visits But Frank had an uncomfortable feeling that Miss Pitty was not the attraction which brought him Little Wade was very fond of him though the boy was shy of most people and even called him Uncle Rhett which annoyed Frank And Frank could not help remembering that Rhett had squired Scarlett about during the war days and there had been talk about them then He imagined there might be even worse talk about them now None of his friends had the courage to mention anything of this sort to Frank for all their outspoken words on Scarletts conduct in the matter of the mill But he could not help noticing that he and Scarlett were less frequently invited to meals and parties and fewer and fewer people came to call on them Scarlett disliked most of her neighbors and was too busy with her mill to care about seeing the ones she did like so the lack of calls did not disturb her But Frank felt it keenly All of his life Frank had been under the domination of the phrase What will the neighbors say and he was defenseless against the shocks of his wifes repeated disregard of the proprieties He felt that everyone disapproved of Scarlett and was contemptuous of him for permitting her to unsex herself She did so many things a husband should not permit according to his views but if he ordered her to stop them argued or even criticized a storm broke on his head My My he thought helplessly She can get mad quicker and stay mad longer than any woman I ever saw Even at the times when things were most pleasant it was amazing how completely and how quickly the teasing affectionate wife who hummed to herself as she went about the house could be transformed into an entirely different person He had only to say Sugar if I were you I wouldnt and the tempest would break Her black brows rushed together to meet in a sharp angle over her nose and Frank cowered almost visibly She had the temper of a Tartar and the rages of a wild cat and at such times she did not seem to care what she said or how much it hurt Clouds of gloom hung over the house on such occasions Frank went early to the store and stayed late Pitty scrambled into her bedroom like a rabbit panting for its burrow Wade and Uncle Peter retired to the carriage house and Cookie kept to her kitchen and forbore to raise her voice to praise the Lord in song Only Mammy endured Scarletts temper with equanimity and Mammy had had many years of training with Gerald OHara and his explosions Scarlett did not mean to be short tempered and she really wanted to make Frank a good wife for she was fond of him and grateful for his help in saving Tara But he did try her patience to the breaking point so often and in so many different ways She could never respect a man who let her run over him and the timid hesitant attitude he displayed in any unpleasant situation with her or with others irritated her unbearably But she could have overlooked these things and even been happy now that some of her money problems were being solved except for her constantly renewed exasperation growing out of the many incidents which showed that Frank was neither a good business man nor did he want her to be a good business man As she expected he had refused to collect the unpaid bills until she prodded him into it and then he had done it apologetically and half heartedly That experience was the final evidence she needed to show her that the Kennedy family would never have more than a bare living unless she personally made the money she was determined to have She knew now that Frank would be contented to dawdle along with his dirty little store for the rest of his life He didnt seem to realize what a slender fingerhold they had on security and how important it was to make more money in these troublous times when money was the only protection against fresh calamities Frank might have been a successful business man in the easy days before the war but he was so annoyingly oldfashioned she thought and so stubborn about wanting to do things in the old ways when the old ways and the old days were gone He was utterly lacking in the aggressiveness needed in these new bitter times Well she had the aggressiveness and she intended to use it whether Frank liked it or not They needed money and she was making money and it was hard work The very least Frank could do in her opinion was not to interfere with her plans which were getting results With her inexperience operating the new mill was no easy job and competition was keener now than it had been at first so she was usually tired and worried and cross when she came home at nights And when Frank would cough apologetically and say Sugar I wouldnt do this or I wouldnt do that Sugar if I were you it was all she could do to restrain herself from flying into a rage and frequently she did not restrain herself If he didnt have the gumption to get out and make some money why was he always finding fault with her And the things he nagged her about were so silly What difference did it make in times like these if she was being unwomanly Especially when her unwomanly sawmill was bringing in money they needed so badly she and the family and Tara and Frank too  Page    Gone With The Wind Frank wanted rest and quiet The war in which he had served so conscientiously had wrecked his health cost him his fortune and made him an old man He regretted none of these things and after four years of war all he asked of life was peace and kindliness loving faces about him and the approval of friends He soon found that domestic peace had its price and that price was letting Scarlett have her own way no matter what she might wish to do So because he was tired he bought peace at her own terms Sometimes he thought it was worth it to have her smiling when she opened the front door in the cold twilights kissing him on the ear or the nose or some other inappropriate place to feel her head snuggling drowsily on his shoulder at night under warm quilts Home life could be so pleasant when Scarlett was having her own way But the peace he gained was hollow only an outward semblance for he had purchased it at the cost of everything he held to be right in married life A woman ought to pay more attention to her home and her family and not be gadding about like a man he thought Now if she just had a baby He smiled when he thought of a baby and he thought of a baby very often Scarlett had been most outspoken about not wanting a child but then babies seldom waited to be invited Frank knew that many women said they didnt want babies but that was all foolishness and fear If Scarlett had a baby she would love it and be content to stay home and tend it like other women Then she would be forced to sell the mill and his problems would be ended All women needed babies to make them completely happy and Frank knew that Scarlett was not happy Ignorant as he was of women he was not so blind that he could not see she was unhappy at times Sometimes he awoke at night and heard the soft sound of tears muffled in the pillow The first time he had waked to feel the bed shaking with her sobbing he had questioned in alarm Sugar what is it and had been rebuked by a passionate cry Oh let me alone Yes a baby would make her happy and would take her mind off things she had no business fooling with Sometimes Frank sighed thinking he had caught a tropic bird all flame and jewel color when a wren would have served him just as well In fact much better  Page    Gone With The Wind CHAPTER XXXVII IT WAS on a wild wet night in April that Tony Fontaine rode in from Jonesboro on a lathered horse that was half dead from exhaustion and came knocking at their door rousing her and Frank from sleep with their hearts in their throats Then for the second time in four months Scarlett was made to feel acutely what Reconstruction in an its implications meant made to understand more completely what was in Wills mind when he said Our troubles have just begun to know that the bleak words of Ashley spoken in the windswept orchard of Tara were true This thats facing all of us is worse than warworse than prisonworse than death The first time she had come face to face with Reconstruction was when she teamed that Jonas Wilkerson with the aid of the Yankees could evict her from Tara But Tonys advent brought it all home to her in a far more terrifying manner Tony came in the dark and the lashing rain and in a few minutes he was gone back into the night forever but in the brief interval between he raised the curtain on a scene of new horror a curtain that she felt hopelessly would never be lowered again That stormy night when the knocker hammered on the door with such hurried urgency she stood on the landing clutching her wrapper to her and looking down into the hall below had one glimpse of Tonys swarthy saturnine face before he leaned forward and blew out the candle in Franks hand She hurried down in the darkness to grasp his cold wet hand and hear him whisper Theyre after megoing to Texasmy horse is about deadand Im about starved Ashley said youd Dont light the candle Dont wake the darkies  I dont want to get you folks in trouble if I can help it With the kitchen blinds drawn and all the shades pulled down to the sills he permitted a light and he talked to Frank in swift jerky sentences as Scarlett hurried about trying to scrape together a meal for him He was without a greatcoat and soaked to the skin He was hatless and his black hair was plastered to his little skin But the merriment of the Fontaine boys a chilling merriment that night was in his little dancing eyes as he gulped down the whisky she brought him Scarlett thanked God that Aunt Pittypat was snoring undisturbed upstairs She would certainly swoon if she saw this apparition One damned bastScalawag less said Tony holding out his glass for another drink Ive ridden hard and itll cost me my skin if I dont get out of here quick but it was worth it By God yes Im going to try to get to Texas and lay low there Ashley was with me in Jonesboro and he told me to come to you all Got to have another horse Frank and some money My horse is nearly deadall the way up here at a dead runand like a fool I went out of the house today like a bat out of hell without a coat or hat or a cent of money Not that theres much money in our house He laughed and applied himself hungrily to the cold corn pone and cold turnip greens on which congealed grease was thick in white flakes You can have my horse said Frank calmly Ive only ten dollars with me but if you can wait till morning Hells afire I cant wait said Tony emphatically but jovially Theyre probably right behind me I didnt get much of a start If it hadnt been for Ashley dragging me out of there and making me get on my horse Id have stayed there like a fool and probably had my neck stretched by now Good fellow Ashley So Ashley was mixed up in this frightening puzzle Scarlett went cold her hand at her throat Did the Yankees have Ashley now Why why didnt Frank ask what it was all about Why did he take it all so coolly so much as a matter of course She struggled to get the question to her lips What she began Who Your fathers old overseerthat damnedJonas Wilkerson Did youis he dead My God Scarlett OHara said Tony peevishly When I start out to cut somebody up you dont think Id be satisfied with scratching him with the blunt side of my knife do you No by God I cut him to ribbons Good said Frank casually I never liked the fellow Scarlett looked at him This was not the meek Frank she knew the nervous beard clawer who she had learned could be bullied with such ease There was an air about him that was crisp and cool and he was meeting the emergency with no unnecessary words He was a man and Tony was a man and this situation of violence was mens business in which a woman had no part But Ashley Did he No He wanted to kill him but I told him it was my right because Sally is my sisterinlaw and he saw reason finally He went into Jonesboro with me in case Wilkerson got me first But I dont think old Ash will get in any trouble about it I hope not Got any jam for this corn pone And can you wrap me up something to take with me I shall scream if you dont tell me everything Wait till Ive gone and then scream if youve got to Ill tell you about it while Frank saddles the horse That damnedWilkerson has caused enough trouble already know how he did you about your taxes Thats just one of his meannesses But the worst thing was the way he kept the darkies stirred up If anybody had told me Id ever live to see the day when Id hate darkies Damn their black souls they believe anything those scoundrels tell them and forget every living thing weve done for them Now the Yankees are talking about letting the darkies vote And they wont let us vote Why theres hardly a handful of Democrats in the whole County who arent barred from voting now that theyve ruled out every man who fought in the Confederate Army And if they give the negroes the vote its the end of us Damn it its our state It doesnt belong to the Yankees By God Scarlett it isnt to be borne And it wont be borne Well do something about it if it means another war Soon well be having nigger judges nigger legislatorsblack apes out of the jungle Pleasehurry tell me What did you do Give me another mite of that pone before you wrap it up Well the word got around that Wilkerson had gone a bit too far with his niggerequality business Oh yes he talks it to those black fools by the hour He had the gallthe Tony spluttered helplessly to say niggers had a right totowhite women Oh Tony no  Page    Gone With The Wind By God yes I dont wonder you look sick But hells afire Scarlett it cant be news to you Theyve been telling it to them here in Atlanta II didnt know Well Frank would have kept it from you Anyway after that we all sort of thought wed call on Mr Wilkerson privately by night and tend to him but before we could You remember that black buck Eustis who used to be our foreman Yes Came to the kitchen door today while Sally was fixing dinner andI dont know what he said to her I guess Ill never know now But he said something and I heard her scream and I ran into the kitchen and there he was drunk as a fiddlers bitchI beg your pardon Scarlett it just slipped out Go on I shot him and when Mother ran in to take care of Sally I got my horse and started to Jonesboro for Wilkerson He was the one to blame The damned black fool would never have thought of it but for him And on the way past Tara I met Ashley and of course he went with me He said to let him do it because of the way Wilkerson acted about Tara and I said No it was my place because Sally was my own dead brothers wife and he went with me arguing the whole way And when we got to town by God Scarlett do you know I hadnt even brought my pistol Id left it in the stable So mad I forgot He paused and gnawed the tough pone and Scarlett shivered The murderous rages of the Fontaines had made County history long before this chapter had opened So I had to take my knife to him I found him in the barroom I got him in a corner with Ashley holding back the others and I told him why before I lit into him Why it was over before I knew it said Tony reflecting First thing I knew Ashley had me on my horse and told me to come to you folks Ashleys a good man in a pinch He keeps his head Frank came in his greatcoat over his arm and handed it to Tony It was his only heavy coat but Scarlett made no protest She seemed so much on the outside of this affair this purely masculine affair But Tonythey need you at home Surely if you went back and explained Frank youve married a fool said Tony with a grin struggling into the coat She thinks the Yankees will reward a man for keeping niggers off his women folks So they will with a drumhead court and a rope Give me a kiss Scarlett Frank wont mind and I may never see you again Texas is a long way off I wont dare write so let the home folks know I got this far in safety She let him kiss her and the two men went out into the driving rain and stood for a moment talking on the back porch Then she heard a sudden splashing of hooves and Tony was gone She opened the door a crack and saw Frank leading a heaving stumbling horse into the carriage house She shut the door again and sat down her knees trembling Now she knew what Reconstruction meant knew as well as if the house were ringed about by naked savages squatting in breech clouts Now there came rushing to her mind many things to which she had given little thought recently conversations she had heard but to which she had not listened masculine talk which had been checked half finished when she came into rooms small incidents in which she had seen no significance at the time Franks futile warnings to her against driving out to the mill with only the feeble Uncle Peter to protect her Now they fitted themselves together into one horrifying picture The negroes were on top and behind them were the Yankee bayonets She could be killed she could be raped and very probably nothing would ever be done about it And anyone who avenged her would be hanged by the Yankees hanged without benefit of trial by judge and jury Yankee officers who knew nothing of law and cared less for the circumstances of the crime could go through the motions of holding a trial and put a rope around a Southerners neck What can we do she thought wringing her hands in an agony of helpless fear What can we do with devils whod hang a nice boy like Tony just for killing a drunken buck and a scoundrelly Scalawag to protect his women folks It isnt to be borne Tony had cried and he was right It couldnt be borne But what could they do except bear it helpless as they were She fell to trembling and for the first time in her life she saw people and events as something apart from herself saw clearly that Scarlett OHara frightened and helpless was not all that mattered There were thousands of women like her all over the South who were frightened and helpless And thousands of men who had laid down their arms at Appomattox had taken them up again and stood ready to risk their necks on a minutes notice to protect those women There had been something in Tonys face which had been mirrored in Franks an expression she had seen recently on the faces of other men in Atlanta a look she had noticed but had not troubled to analyze It was an expression vastly different from the tired helplessness she had seen in the faces of men coming home from the war after the surrender Those men had not cared about anything except getting home Now they were caring about something again numbed nerves were coming back to life and the old spirit was beginning to burn They were caring again with a cold ruthless bitterness And like Tony they were thinking It isnt to be borne She had seen Southern men soft voiced and dangerous in the days before the war reckless and hard in the last despairing days of the fighting But in the faces of the two men who stared at each other across the candle flame so short a while ago there had been something that was different something that heartened her but frightened herfury which could find no words determination which would stop at nothing For the first time she felt a kinship with the people about her felt one with them in their fears their bitterness their determination No it wasnt to be borne The South was too beautiful a place to be let go without a struggle too loved to be trampled by Yankees who hated Southerners enough to enjoy grinding them into the dirt too dear a homeland to be turned over to ignorant negroes drunk with whisky and freedom As she thought of Tonys sudden entrance and swift exit she felt herself akin to him for she remembered the old story how her father had left Ireland left hastily and by night after a murder which was no murder to him or to his family Geralds blood was in her violent blood She remembered her hot joy in shooting the marauding Yankee Violent blood was in them all perilously close to the surface lurking just beneath the kindly courteous exteriors All of them all the men she knew even the drowsyeyed Ashley and fidgety old Frank were like that underneathmurderous violent if the need arose Even Rhett conscienceless scamp that he was had killed a negro for being uppity to a lady  Page    Gone With The Wind Oh Frank how long will it be like this she leaped to her feet As long as the Yankees hate us so Sugar Is there nothing anybody can do Frank passed a tired hand over his wet beard We are doing things What Why talk of them till we have accomplished something It may take years Perhapsperhaps the South will always be like this Oh no Sugar come to bed You must be chilled You are shaking When will it all end When we can all vote again Sugar When every man who fought for the South can put a ballot in the box for a Southerner and a Democrat A ballot she cried despairingly What goods a ballot when the darkies have lost their mindswhen the Yankees have poisoned them against us Frank went on to explain in his patient manner but the idea that ballots could cure the trouble was too complicated for her to follow She was thinking gratefully that Jonas Wilkerson would never again be a menace of Tara and she was thinking about Tony Oh the poor Fontaines she exclaimed Only Alex left and so much to do at Mimosa Why didnt Tony have sense enough toto do it at night when no one would know who it was A sight more good hed do helping with the spring plowing than in Texas Frank put an arm about her Usually he was gingerly when he did this as if he anticipated being impatiently shaken off but tonight there was a faroff look in his eyes and his arm was firm about her waist There are things more important now than plowing Sugar And scaring the darkies and teaching the Scalawags a lesson is one of them As long as there are fine boys like Tony left I guess we wont need to worry about the South too much Come to bed But Frank If we just stand together and dont give an inch to the Yankees well win some day Dont you bother your pretty head about it Sugar You let your men folks worry about it Maybe it wont come in our time but surely it will come some day The Yankees will get tired of pestering us when they see they cant even dent us and then well have a decent world to live in and raise our children in She thought of Wade and the secret she had carried silently for some days No she didnt want her children raised in this welter of hate and uncertainty of bitterness and violence lurking just below the surface of poverty and grinding hardships and insecurity She never wanted children of hers to know what all this was like She wanted a secure and wellordered world in which she could look forward and know there was a safe future ahead for them a world where her children would know only softness and warmth and good clothes and fine food Frank thought this could be accomplished by voting Voting What did votes matter Nice people in the South would never have the vote again There was only one thing in the world that was a certain bulwark against any calamity which fate could bring and that was money She thought feverishly that they must have money lots of it to keep them safe against disaster Abruptly she told him she was going to have a baby For weeks after Tonys escape Aunt Pittys house was subjected to repeated searches by parties of Yankee soldiers They invaded the house at all hours and without warning They swarmed through the rooms asking questions opening closets prodding clothes hampers peering under beds The military authorities had heard that Tony had been advised to go to Miss Pittys house and they were certain he was still hiding there or somewhere in the neighborhood As a result Aunt Pitty was chronically in what Uncle Peter called a state never knowing when her bedroom would be entered by an officer and a squad of men Neither Frank nor Scarlett had mentioned Tonys brief visit so the old lady could have revealed nothing even had she been so inclined She was entirely honest in her fluttery protestations that she had seen Tony Fontaine only once in her life and that was at Christmas time in  And she would add breathlessly to the Yankee soldiers in an effort to be helpful he was quite intoxicated at the time Scarlett sick and miserable in the early stage of pregnancy alternated between a passionate hatred of the bluecoats who invaded her privacy frequently carrying away any little knickknack that appealed to them and an equally passionate fear that Tony might prove the undoing of them all The prisons were full of people who had been arrested for much less reason She knew that if one iota of the truth were proved against them not only she and Frank but the innocent Pitty as well would go to jail For some time there had been an agitation in Washington to confiscate all Rebel property to pay the United States war debt and this agitation had kept Scarlett in a state of anguished apprehension Now in addition to this Atlanta was full of wild rumors about the confiscation of property of offenders against military law and Scarlett quaked lest she and Frank lose not only their freedom but the house the store and the mill And even if their property were not appropriated by the military it would be as good as lost if she and Frank went to jail for who would look after their business in their absence She hated Tony for bringing such trouble upon them How could he have done such a thing to friends And how could Ashley have sent Tony to them Never again would she give aid to anyone if it meant having the Yankees come down on her like a swarm of hornets No she would bar the door against anyone needing help Except of course Ashley For weeks after Tonys brief visit she woke from uneasy dreams at any sound in the road outside fearing it might be Ashley trying to make his escape fleeing to Texas because of the aid he had given Tony She did not know how matters stood with him for they did not dare write to Tara about Tonys midnight visit Their letters might be intercepted by the Yankees and bring trouble upon the plantation as well But when weeks went by and they heard no bad news they knew that Ashley had somehow come clear And finally the Yankees ceased annoying them  Page    Gone With The Wind But even this relief did not free Scarlett from the state of dread which began when Tony came knocking at their door a dread which was worse than the quaking fear of the siege shells worse even than the terror of Shermans men during the last days of the war It was as if Tonys appearance that wild rainy night had stripped merciful blinders from her eyes and forced her to see the true uncertainty of her life Looking about her in that cold spring of  Scarlett realized what was facing her and the whole South She might plan and scheme she might work harder than her slaves had ever worked she might succeed in overcoming all of her hardships she might through dint of determination solve problems for which her earlier life had provided no training at all But for all her labor and sacrifice and resourcefulness her small beginnings purchased at so great a cost might be snatched away from her at any minute And should this happen she had no legal rights no legal redress except those same drumhead courts of which Tony had spoken so bitterly those military courts with their arbitrary powers Only the negroes had rights or redress these days The Yankees had the South prostrate and they intended to keep it so The South had been tilted as by a giant malicious hand and those who had once ruled were now more helpless than their former slaves had ever been Georgia was heavily garrisoned with troops and Atlanta had more than its share The commandants of the Yankee troops in the various cities had complete power even the power of life and death over the civilian population and they used that power They could and did imprison citizens for any cause or no cause seize their property hang them They could and did harass and hamstring them with conflicting regulations about the operation of their business the wages they must pay their servants what they should say in public and private utterances and what they should write in newspapers They regulated how when and where they must dump their garbage and they decided what songs the daughters and wives of exConfederates could sing so that the singing of Dixie or Bonnie Blue Flag became an offense only a little less serious than treason They ruled that no one could get a letter out of the post office without taking the Iron Clad oath and in some instances they even prohibited the issuance of marriage licenses unless the couples had taken the hated oath The newspapers were so muzzled that no public protest could be raised against the injustices or depredations of the military and individual protests were silenced with jail sentences The jails were full of prominent citizens and there they stayed without hope of early trial Trial by jury and the law of habeas corpus were practically suspended The civil courts still functioned after a fashion but they functioned at the pleasure of the military who could and did interfere with their verdicts so that citizens so unfortunate as to get arrested were virtually at the mercy of the military authorities And so many did get arrested The very suspicion of seditious utterances against the government suspected complicity in the Ku Klux Klan or complaint by a negro that a white man had been uppity to him were enough to land a citizen in jail Proof and evidence were not needed The accusation was sufficient And thanks to the incitement of the Freedmens Bureau negroes could always be found who were willing to bring accusations The negroes had not yet been given the right to vote but the North was determined that they should vote and equally determined that their vote should be friendly to the North With this in mind nothing was too good for the negroes The Yankee soldiers backed them up in anything they chose to do and the surest way for a white person to get himself into trouble was to bring a complaint of any kind against a negro The former slaves were now the lords of creation and with the aid of the Yankees the lowest and most ignorant ones were on top The better class of them scorning freedom were suffering as severely as their white masters Thousands of house servants the highest caste in the slave population remained with their white folks doing manual labor which had been beneath them in the old days Many loyal field hands also refused to avail themselves of the new freedom but the hordes of trashy free issue niggers who were causing most of the trouble were drawn largely from the fieldhand class In slave days these lowly blacks had been despised by the house negroes and yard negroes as creatures of small worth Just as Ellen had done other plantation mistresses throughout the South had put the pickaninnies through courses of training and elimination to select the best of them for the positions of greater responsibility Those consigned to the fields were the ones least willing or able to learn the least energetic the least honest and trustworthy the most vicious and brutish And now this class the lowest in the black social order was making life a misery for the South Aided by the unscrupulous adventurers who operated the Freedmens Bureau and urged on by a fervor of Northern hatred almost religious in its fanaticism the former field hands found themselves suddenly elevated to the seats of the mighty There they conducted themselves as creatures of small intelligence might naturally be expected to do Like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects whose value is beyond their comprehension they ran wildeither from perverse pleasure in destruction or simply because of their ignorance To the credit of the negroes including the least intelligent of them few were actuated by malice and those few had usually been mean niggers even in slave days But they were as a class childlike in mentality easily led and from long habit accustomed to taking orders Formerly their white masters had given the orders Now they had a new set of masters the Bureau and the Carpetbaggers and their orders were Youre just as good as any white man so act that way Just as soon as you can vote the Re publican ticket you are going to have the white mans property Its as good as yours now Take it if you can get it Dazzled by these tales freedom became a neverending picnic a barbecue every day of the week a carnival of idleness and theft and insolence Country negroes flocked into the cities leaving the rural districts without labor to make the crops Atlanta was crowded with them and still they came by the hundreds lazy and dangerous as a result of the new doctrines being taught them Packed into squalid cabins smallpox typhoid and tuberculosis broke out among them Accustomed to the care of their mistresses when they were ill in slave days they did not know how to nurse themselves or their sick Relying upon their masters in the old days to care for their aged and their babies they now had no sense of responsibility for their helpless And the Bureau was far too interested in political matters to provide the care the plantation owners had once given Abandoned negro children ran like frightened animals about the town until kindhearted white people took them into their kitchens to raise Aged country darkies deserted by their children bewildered and panic stricken in the bustling town sat on the curbs and cried to the ladies who passed Mistis please Mam write mah old Marster down in Fayette County dat Ahs up hyah Hell come tek dis ole nigger home agin Fo Gawd Ah done got nuff of dis freedom  Page    Gone With The Wind The Freedmens Bureau overwhelmed by the numbers who poured in upon them realized too late a part of the mistake and tried to send them back to their former owners They told the negroes that if they would go back they would go as free workers protected by written contracts specifying wages by the day The old darkies went back to the plantations gladly making a heavier burden than ever on the povertystricken planters who had not the heart to turn them out but the young ones remained in Atlanta They did not want to be workers of any kind anywhere Why work when the belly is full For the first time in their lives the negroes were able to get all the whisky they might want In slave days it was something they never tasted except at Christmas when each one received a drap along with his gift Now they had not only the Bureau agitators and the Carpetbaggers urging them on but the incitement of whisky as well and outrages were inevitable Neither life nor property was safe from them and the white people unprotected by law were terrorized Men were insulted on the streets by drunken blacks houses and barns were burned at night horses and cattle and chickens stolen in broad daylight crimes of all varieties were committed and few of the perpetrators were brought to justice But these ignominies and dangers were as nothing compared with the peril of white women many bereft by the war of male protection who lived alone in the outlying districts and on lonely roads It was the large number of outrages on women and the everpresent fear for the safety of their wives and daughters that drove Southern men to cold and trembling fury and caused the Ku Klux Klan to spring up overnight And it was against this nocturnal organization that the newspapers of the North cried out most loudly never realizing the tragic necessity that brought it into being The North wanted every member of the Ku Klux hunted down and hanged because they had dared take the punishment of crime into their own hands at a time when the ordinary processes of law and order had been overthrown by the invaders Here was the astonishing spectacle of half a nation attempting at the point of bayonet to force upon the other half the rule of negroes many of them scarcely one generation out of the African jungles The vote must be given to them but it must be denied to most of their former owners The South must be kept down and disfranchisement of the whites was one way to keep the South down Most of those who had fought for the Confederacy held office under it or given aid and comfort to it were not allowed to vote had no choice in the selection of their public officials and were wholly under the power of an alien rule Many men thinking soberly of General Lees words and example wished to take the oath become citizens again and forget the past But they were not permitted to take it Others who were permitted to take the oath hotly refused to do so scorning to swear allegiance to a government which was deliberately subjecting them to cruelty and humiliation Scarlett heard over and over until she could have screamed at the repetition Id have taken their damned oath right after the surrender if theyd acted decent I can be restored to the Union but by God I cant be reconstructed into it Through these anxious days and nights Scarlett was torn with fear The everpresent menace of lawless negroes and Yankee soldiers preyed on her mind the danger of confiscation was constantly with her even in her dreams and she dreaded worse terrors to come Depressed by the helplessness of herself and her friends of the whole South it was not strange that she often remembered during these days the words which Tony Fontaine had spoken so passionately God God Scarlett it isnt to be borne And it wont be borne In spite of war fire and Reconstruction Atlanta had again become a boom town In many ways the place resembled the busy young city of the Confederacys early days The only trouble was that the soldiers crowding the streets wore the wrong kind of uniforms the money was in the hands of the wrong people and the negroes were living in leisure while their former masters struggled and starved Underneath the surface were misery and fear but all the outward appearances were those of a thriving town that was rapidly rebuilding from its ruins a bustling hurrying town Atlanta it seemed must always be hurrying no matter what its circumstances might be Savannah Charleston Augusta Richmond New Orleans would never hurry It was ill bred and Yankeefied to hurry But in this period Atlanta was more ill bred and Yankeefied than it had ever been before or would ever be again With new people thronging in from all directions the streets were choked and noisy from morning till night The shiny carriages of Yankee officers wives and newly rich Carpetbaggers splashed mud on the dilapidated buggies of the townspeople and gaudy new homes of wealthy strangers crowded in among the sedate dwellings of older citizens The war had definitely established the importance of Atlanta in the affairs of the South and the hitherto obscure town was now known far and wide The railroads for which Sherman had fought an entire summer and killed thousands of men were again stimulating the life of the city they had brought into being Atlanta was again the center of activities for a wide region as it had been before its destruction and the town was receiving a great influx of new citizens both welcome and unwelcome Invading Carpetbaggers made Atlanta their headquarters and on the streets they jostled against representatives of the oldest families in the South who were likewise newcomers in the town Families from the country districts who had been burned out during Shermans march and who could no longer make a living without the slaves to till the cotton had come to Atlanta to live New settlers were coming in every day from Tennessee and the Carolinas where the hand of Reconstruction lay even heavier than in Georgia Many Irish and Germans who had been bounty men in the Union Army had settled in Atlanta after their discharge The wives and families of the Yankee garrison filled with curiosity about the South after four years of war came to swell the population Adventurers of every kind swarmed in hoping to make their fortunes and the negroes from the country continued to come by the hundreds The town was roaringwide open like a frontier village making no effort to cover its vices and sins Saloons blossomed overnight two and sometimes three in a block and after nightfall the streets were full of drunken men black and white reeling from wall to curb and back again Thugs pickpockets and prostitutes lurked in the unlit alleys and shadowy streets Gambling houses ran full blast and hardly a night passed without its shooting or cutting affray Respectable citizens were scandalized to find that Atlanta had a large and thriving redlight district larger and more thriving than during the war All night long pianos jangled from behind drawn shades and rowdy songs and laughter floated out punctuated by occasional screams and pistol shots The inmates of these houses were bolder than the prostitutes of the war days and brazenly hung out of their windows and called to passersby And on Sunday afternoons the handsome closed carriages of the madams of the district rolled down the main streets  Page    Gone With The Wind filled with girls in their best finery taking the air from behind lowered silk shades Belle Watling was the most notorious of the madams She had opened a new house of her own a large twostory building that made neighboring houses in the district look like shabby rabbit warrens There was a long barroom downstairs elegantly hung with oil paintings and a negro orchestra played every night The upstairs so rumor said was fitted out with the finest of plush upholstered furniture heavy lace curtains and imported mirrors in gilt frames The dozen young ladies with whom the house was furnished were comely if brightly painted and comported themselves more quietly than those of other houses At least the police were seldom summoned to Belles This house was something that the matrons of Atlanta whispered about furtively and ministers preached against in guarded terms as a cesspool of iniquity a hissing and a reproach Everyone knew that a woman of Belles type couldnt have made enough money by herself to set up such a luxurious establishment She had to have a backer and a rich one at that And Rhett Butler had never had the decency to conceal his relations with her so it was obvious that he and no other must be that backer Belle herself presented a prosperous appearance when glimpsed occasionally in her closed carriage driven by an impudent yellow negro When she drove by behind a fine pair of bays all the little boys along the street who could evade their mothers ran to peer at her and whisper excitedly Thats her Thats ole Belle I seen her red hair Shouldering the shellpitted houses patched with bits of old lumber and smokeblackened bricks the fine homes of the Carpetbaggers and war profiteers were rising with mansard roofs gables and turrets stainedglass windows and wide lawns Night after night in these newly built homes the windows were ablaze with gas light and the sound of music and dancing feet drifted out upon the air Women in stiff brightcolored silks strolled about long verandas squired by men in evening clothes Champagne corks popped and on lace tablecloths sevencourse dinners were laid Hams in wine pressed duck pt de foie gras rare fruits in and out of season were spread in profusion Behind the shabby doors of the old houses poverty and hunger livedall the more bitter for the brave gentility with which they were borne all the more pinching for the outward show of proud indifference to material wants Dr Meade could tell unlovely stories of those families who had been driven from mansions to boarding houses and from boarding houses to dingy rooms on back streets He had too many lady patients who were suffering from weak hearts and declines He knew and they knew he knew that slow starvation was the trouble He could tell of consumption making inroads on entire families and of pellagra once found only among poor whites which was now appearing in Atlantas best families And there were babies with thin rickety legs and mothers who could not nurse them Once the old doctor had been wont to thank God reverently for each child he brought into the world Now he did not think life was such a boon It was a hard world for little babies and so many died in their first few months of life Bright lights and wine fiddles and dancing brocade and broadcloth in the showy big houses and just around the corners slow starvation and cold Arrogance and callousness for the conquerors bitter endurance and hatred for the conquered CHAPTER XXXVIII SCARLETT SAW IT ALL lived with it by day took it to bed with her at night dreading always what might happen next She knew that she and Frank were already in the Yankees black books because of Tony and disaster might descend on them at any hour But now of all times she could not afford to be pushed back to her beginningsnot now with a baby coming the mill just commencing to pay and Tara depending on her for money until the cotton came in in the fall Oh suppose she should lose every thing Suppose she should have to start all over again with only her puny weapons against this mad world To have to pit her red lips and green eyes and her shrewd shallow brain against the Yankees and everything the Yankees stood for Weary with dread she felt that she would rather kill herself than try to make a new beginning In the ruin and chaos of that spring of  she single mindedly turned her energies to making the mill pay There was money in Atlanta The wave of rebuilding was giving her the opportunity she wanted and she knew she could make money if only she could stay out of jail But she told herself time and again she would have to walk easily gingerly be meek under insults yielding to injustices never giving offense to anyone black or white who might do her harm She hated the impudent free negroes as much as anyone and her flesh crawled with fury every time she heard their insulting remarks and highpitched laughter as she went by But she never even gave them a glance of contempt She hated the Carpetbaggers and Scalawags who were getting rich with ease while she struggled but she said nothing in condemnation of them No one in Atlanta could have loathed the Yankees more than she for the very sight of a blue uniform made her sick with rage but even in the privacy of her family she kept silent about them I wont be a bigmouthed fool she thought grimly Let others break their hearts over the old days and the men wholl never come back Let others burn with fury over the Yankee rule and losing the ballot Let others go to jail for speaking their minds and get themselves hanged for being in the Ku Klux Klan Oh what a dreaded name that was almost as terrifying to Scarlett as to the negroes Let other women be proud that their husbands belonged Thank God Frank had never been mixed up in it Let others stew and fume and plot and plan about things they could not help What did the past matter compared with the tense present and the dubious future What did the ballot matter when bread a roof and staying out of jail were the real problems And please God just let me stay out of trouble until June Only till June By that month Scarlett knew she would be forced to retire into Aunt Pittys house and remain secluded there until after her child was born Already people were criticizing her for appearing in public when she was in such a condition No lady ever showed herself when she was pregnant Already Frank and Pitty were begging her not to expose herselfand themto embarrassment and she had promised them to stop work in June Only till June By June she must have the mill well enough established for her to leave it By June she must have money enough to give her at least some little protection against misfortune So much to do and so little time to do it She wished for more hours of the day and counted the minutes as she strained forward feverishly in her pursuit of money and still more money Because she nagged the timid Frank the store was doing better now and he was even collecting some of the old bills But it was  Page    Gone With The Wind the sawmill on which her hopes were pinned Atlanta these days was like a giant plant which had been cut to the ground but now was springing up again with sturdier shoots thicker foliage more numerous branches The demand for building materials was far greater than could be supplied Prices of lumber brick and stone soared and Scarlett kept the mill running from dawn until lantern light A part of every day she spent at the mill prying into everything doing her best to check the thievery she felt sure was going on But most of the time she was riding about the town making the rounds of builders contractors and carpenters even calling on strangers she had heard might build at future dates cajoling them into promises of buying from her and her only Soon she was a familiar sight on Atlantas streets sitting in her buggy beside the dignified disapproving old darky driver a lap robe pulled high about her her little mittened hands clasped in her lap Aunt Pitty had made her a pretty green mantelet which hid her figure and a green pancake hat which matched her eyes and she always wore these becoming garments on her business calls A faint dab of rouge on her cheeks and a fainter fragrance of cologne made her a charming picture as long as she did not alight from the buggy and show her figure And there was seldom any need for this for she smiled and beckoned and the men came quickly to the buggy and frequently stood bareheaded in the rain to talk business with her She was not the only one who had seen the opportunities for making money out of lumber but she did not fear her competitors She knew with conscious pride in her own smartness that she was the equal of any of them She was Geralds own daughter and the shrewd trading instinct she had inherited was now sharpened by her needs At first the other dealers had laughed at her laughed with goodnatured contempt at the very idea of a woman in business But now they did not laugh They swore silently as they saw her ride by The fact that she was a woman frequently worked in her favor for she could upon occasion look so helpless and appealing that she melted hearts With no difficulty whatever she could mutely convey the impression of a brave but timid lady forced by brutal circumstance into a distasteful position a helpless little lady who would probably starve if customers didnt buy her lumber But when ladylike airs failed to get results she was coldly businesslike and willingly undersold her competitors at a loss to herself if it would bring her a new customer She was not above selling a poor grade of lumber for the price of good lumber if she thought she would not be detected and she had no scruples about blackguarding the other lumber dealers With every appearance of reluctance at disclosing the unpleasant truth she would sigh and tell prospective customers that her competitors lumber was far too high in price rotten full of knot holes and in general of deplorably poor quality The first time Scarlett lied in this fashion she felt disconcerted and guiltydisconcerted because the lie sprang so easily and naturally to her lips guilty because the thought flashed into her mind What would Mother say There was no doubt what Ellen would say to a daughter who told lies and engaged in sharp practices She would be stunned and incredulous and would speak gentle words that stung despite their gentleness would talk of honor and honesty and truth and duty to ones neighbor Momentarily Scarlett cringed as she pictured the look on her mothers face And then the picture faded blotted out by an impulse hard unscrupulous and greedy which had been born in the lean days at Tara and was now strength ened by the present uncertainty of life So she passed this milestone as she had passed others before itwith a sigh that she was not as Ellen would like her to be a shrug and the repetition of her unfailing charm Ill think of all this later But she never again thought of Ellen in connection with her business practices never again regretted any means she used to take trade away from other lumber dealers She knew she was perfectly safe in lying about them Southern chivalry protected her A Southern lady could lie about a gentleman but a Southern gentleman could not lie about a lady or worse still call the lady a liar Other lumbermen could only fume inwardly and state heatedly in the bosoms of their families that they wished to God Mrs Kennedy was a man for just about five minutes One poor white who operated a mill on the Decatur road did try to fight Scarlett with her own weapons saying openly that she was a liar and a swindler But it hurt him rather than helped for everyone was appalled that even a poor white should say such shocking things about a lady of good family even when the lady was conducting herself in such an unwomanly way Scarlett bore his remarks with silent dignity and as time went by she turned all her attention to him and his customers She undersold him so relentlessly and delivered with secret groans such an excellent quality of lumber to prove her probity that he was soon bankrupt Then to Franks horror she triumphantly bought his mill at her own price Once in her possession there arose the perplexing problem of finding a trustworthy man to put in charge of it She did not want another man like Mr Johnson She knew that despite all her watchfulness he was still selling her lumber behind her back but she thought it would be easy to find the right sort of man Wasnt everybody as poor as Jobs turkey and werent the streets full of men some of them formerly rich who were without work The day never went by that Frank did not give money to some hungry exsoldier or that Pitty and Cookie did not wrap up food for gaunt beggars But Scarlett for some reason she could not understand did not want any of these I dont want men who havent found something to do after a year she thought If they havent adjusted to peace yet they couldnt adjust to me And they all look so hangdog and licked I dont want a man whos licked I want somebody whos smart and energetic like Renny or Tommy Wellburn or Kells Whiting or one of the Simmons boys oror any of that tribe They havent got that Idontcareaboutanything look the soldiers had right after the surrender They look like they cared a heap about a heap of things But to her surprise the Simmons boys who had started a brick kiln and Kells Whiting who was selling a preparation made up in his mothers kitchen that was guaranteed to straighten the lankiest negro hair in six applications smiled politely thanked her and refused It was the same with the dozen others she approached In desperation she raised the wage she was offering but she was still refused One of Mrs Merriwethers nephews observed impertinently that while he didnt especially enjoy driving a dray it was his own dray and he would rather get somewhere under his own steam than Scarletts One afternoon Scarlett pulled up her buggy beside Ren Picards pie wagon and hailed Ren and the crippled Tommy Wellburn who was catching a ride home with his friend Look here Renny why dont you come and work for me Managing a mill is a sight more respectable than driving a pie wagon Id think youd be ashamed  Page    Gone With The Wind Me I am dead to shame grinned Ren Who would be respectable All of my days I was respectable until ze war set me free lak ze darkies Nevaire again must I be deegneefied and full of ennui Free lak ze bird I lak my pie wagon I lak my mule I lak ze dear Yankees who so kindly buy ze pie of Madame Belle Mre No my Scarlett I must be ze King of ze Pies Eet ees my destiny Lak Napoleon I follow my star He flourished his whip dramatically But you werent raised to sell pies any more than Tommy was raised to wrastle with a bunch of wild Irish masons My kind of work is more And I suppose you were raised to run a lumber mill said Tommy the corners of his mouth twitching Yes I can just see little Scarlett at her mothers knee lisping her lesson Never sell good lumber if you can get a better price for bad  Ren roared at this his small monkey eyes dancing with glee as he whacked Tommy on his twisted back Dont be impudent said Scarlett coldly for she saw little humor in Tommys remark Of course I wasnt raised to run a sawmill I didnt mean to be impudent But you are running a sawmill whether you were raised to it or not And running it very well too Well none of us as far as I can see are doing what we intended to do right now but I think well make out just the same Its a poor person and a poor nation that sits down and cries because life isnt precisely what they expected it to be Why dont you pick up some enterprising Carpetbagger to work for you Scarlett The woods are full of them God knows I dont want a Carpetbagger Carpetbaggers will steal anything that isnt red hot or nailed down If they amounted to anything theyd have stayed where they were instead of coming down here to pick our bones I want a nice man from nice folks who is smart and honest and energetic and You dont want much And you wont get it for the wage youre offering All the men of that description barring the badly maimed ones have already got something to do They may be round pegs in square holes but theyve all got something to do Something of their own that theyd rather do than work for a woman Men havent got much sense have they when you get down to rock bottom Maybe not but theyve got a heap of pride said Tommy soberly Pride Pride tastes awfully good especially when the crust is flaky and you put meringue on it said Scarlett tartly The two men laughed a bit unwillingly and it seemed to Scarlett that they drew together in united masculine disapproval of her What Tommy said was true she thought running over in her mind the men she had approached and the ones she intended to approach They were all busy busy at something working hard working harder than they would have dreamed possible in the days before the war They werent doing what they wanted to do perhaps or what was easiest to do or what they had been reared to do but they were doing something Times were too hard for men to be choosy And if they were sorrowing for lost hopes longing for lost ways of living no one knew it but they They were fighting a new war a harder war than the one before And they were caring about life again caring with the same urgency and the same violence that animated them before the war had cut their lives in two Scarlett said Tommy awkwardly I do hate to ask a favor of you after being impudent to you but Im going to ask it just the same Maybe it would help you anyway My brotherinlaw Hugh Elsing isnt doing any too well peddling kindling wood Everybody except the Yankees goes out and collects his own kindling wood And I know things are mighty hard with the whole Elsing family II do what I can but you see Ive got Fanny to support and then too Ive got my mother and two widowed sisters down in Sparta to look after Hugh is nice and you wanted a nice man and hes from nice folks as you know and hes honest Butwell Hugh hasnt got much gumption or else hed make a success of his kindling Tommy shrugged Youve got a hard way of looking at things Scarlett he said But you think Hugh over You could go far and do worse I think his honesty and his willingness will outweigh his lack of gumption Scarlett did not answer for she did not want to be too rude But to her mind there were few if any qualities that outweighed gumption After she had unsuccessfully canvassed the town and refused the importuning of many eager Carpetbaggers she finally decided to take Tommys suggestion and ask Hugh Elsing He had been a dashing and resourceful officer during the war but two severe wounds and four years of fighting seemed to have drained him of all his resourcefulness leaving him to face the rigors of peace as bewildered as a child There was a lostdog look in his eyes these days as he went about peddling his firewood and he was not at all the kind of man she had hoped to get Hes stupid she thought He doesnt know a thing about business and Ill bet he cant add two and two And I doubt if hell ever learn But at least hes honest and wont swindle me Scarlett had little use these days for honesty in herself but the less she valued it in herself the more she was beginning to value it in others Its a pity Johnnie Gallegher is tied up with Tommy Wellburn on that construction work she thought Hes just the kind of man I want Hes hard as nails and slick as a snake but hed be honest if it paid him to be honest I understand him and he understands me and we could do business together very well Maybe I can get him when the hotel is finished and till then Ill have to make out on Hugh and Mr Johnson If I put Hugh in charge of the new mill and leave Mr Johnson at the old one I can stay in town and see to the selling while they handle the milling and hauling Until I can get Johnnie Ill have to risk Mr Johnson robbing me if I stay in town all the time If only he wasnt a thief I believe Ill build a lumber yard on half that lot Charles left me If only Frank didnt holler so loud about me building a saloon on the other half Well I shall build the saloon just as soon as I get enough money ahead no matter how he takes on If only Frank wasnt so thin skinned Oh God if only I wasnt going to have a baby at this of all times In a little while Ill be so big I cant go out Oh God if only I wasnt going to have a baby And oh God if the damned Yankees will only let me alone If If If If There were so many ifs in life never any certainty of anything never any sense of security always the dread of losing everything and being cold and hungry again Of course Frank was making a little more money now but Frank was always ailing  Page    Gone With The Wind with colds and frequently forced to stay in bed for days Suppose he should become an invalid No she could not afford to count on Frank for much She must not count on anything or anybody but herself And what she could earn seemed so pitiably small Oh what would she do if the Yankees came and took it all away from her If If If Half of what she made every month went to Will at Tara part to Rhett to repay his loan and the rest she hoarded No miser ever counted his gold oftener than she and no miser ever had greater fear of losing it She would not put the money in the bank for it might fail or the Yankees might confiscate it So she carried what she could with her tucked into her corset and hid small wads of bills about the house under loose bricks on the hearth in her scrap bag between the pages of the Bible And her temper grew shorter and shorter as the weeks went by for every dollar she saved would be just one more dollar to lose if disaster descended Frank Pitty and the servants bore her outbursts with maddening kindness attributing her bad disposition to her pregnancy never realizing the true cause Frank knew that pregnant women must be humored so he put his pride in his pocket and said nothing more about her running the mills and her going about town at such a time as no lady should do Her conduct was a constant embarrassment to him but he reckoned he could endure it for a while longer After the baby came he knew she would be the same sweet feminine girl he had courted But in spite of everything he did to appease her she continued to have her tantrums and often he thought she acted like one possessed No one seemed to realize what really possessed her what drove her like a mad woman It was a passion to get her affairs in order before she had to retire behind doors to have as much money as possible in case the deluge broke upon her again to have a stout levee of cash against the rising tide of Yankee hate Money was the obsession dominating her mind these days When she thought of the baby at all it was with baffled rage at the untimeliness of it Death and taxes and childbirth Theres never any convenient time for any of them Atlanta had been scandalized enough when Scarlett a woman began operating the sawmill but as time went by the town decided there was no limit to what she would do Her sharp trading was shocking especially when her poor mother had been a Robillard and it was positively indecent the way she kept on going about the streets when everyone knew she was pregnant No respectable white woman and few negroes ever went outside their homes from the moment they first suspected they were with child and Mrs Merriwether declared indignantly that from the way Scarlett was acting she was likely to have the baby on the public streets But all the previous criticism of her conduct was as nothing compared with the buzz of gossip that now went through the town Scarlett was not only trafficking with the Yankees but was giving every appearance of really liking it Mrs Merriwether and many other Southerners were also doing business with the newcomers from the North but the difference was that they did not like it and plainly showed they did not like it And Scarlett did or seemed to which was just as bad She had actually taken tea with the Yankee officers wives in their homes In fact she had done practically everything short of inviting them into her own home and the town guessed she would do even that except for Aunt Pitty and Frank Scarlett knew the town was talking but she did not care could not afford to care She still hated the Yankees with as fierce a hate as on the day when they tried to burn Tara but she could dissemble that hate She knew that if she was going to make money she would have to make it out of the Yankees and she had learned that buttering them up with smiles and kind words was the surest way to get their business for her mill Some day when she was very rich and her money was hidden away where the Yankees could not find it then then she would tell them exactly what she thought of them tell them how she hated and loathed and despised them And what a joy that would be But until that time came it was just plain common sense to get along with them And if that was hypocrisy let Atlanta make the most of it She discovered that making friends with the Yankee officers was as easy as shooting birds on the ground They were lonely exiles in a hostile land and many of them were starved for polite feminine associations in a town where respectable women drew their skirts aside in passing and looked as if they would like to spit on them Only the prostitutes and the negro women had kind words for them But Scarlett was obviously a lady and a lady of family for all that she worked and they thrilled to her flashing smile and the pleasant light in her green eyes Frequently when Scarlett sat in her buggy talking to them and making her dimples play her dislike for them rose so strong that it was hard not to curse them to their faces But she restrained herself and she found that twisting Yankee men around her finger was no more difficult than that same diversion had been with Southern men Only this was no diversion but a grim business The role she enacted was that of a refined sweet Southern lady in distress With an air of dignified reserve she was able to keep her victims at their proper distance but there was nevertheless a graciousness in her manner which left a certain warmth in the Yankee officers memories of Mrs Kennedy This warmth was very profitableas Scarlett had intended it to be Many of the officers of the garrison not knowing how long they would be stationed in Atlanta had sent for their wives and families As the hotels and boarding houses were overflowing they were building small houses and they were glad to buy their lumber from the gracious Mrs Kennedy who treated them more politely than anyone else in town The Carpetbaggers and Scalawags also who were building fine homes and stores and hotels with their new wealth found it more pleasant to do business with her than with the former Confederate soldiers who were courteous but with a courtesy more formal and cold than outspoken hate So because she was pretty and charming and could appear quite helpless and forlorn at times they gladly patronized her lumber yard and also Franks store feeling that they should help a plucky little woman who apparently had only a shiftless husband to support her And Scarlett watching the business grow felt that she was safeguarding not only the present with Yankee money but the future with Yankee friends Keeping her relations with the Yankee officers on the plane she desired was easier man she expected for they all seemed to be in awe of Southern ladies but Scarlett soon found that their wives presented a problem she had not anticipated Contacts with the Yankee women were not of her seeking She would have been glad to avoid them but she could not for the officers wives were determined to meet her They had an avid curiosity about the South and Southern women and Scarlett gave them their first  Page    Gone With The Wind opportunity to satisfy it Other Atlanta women would have nothing to do with them and even refused to bow to them in church so when business brought Scarlett to their homes she was like an answer to prayer Often when Scarlett sat in her buggy in front of a Yankee home talking of uprights and shingles with the man of the house the wife came out to join in the conversation or insist that she come inside for a cup of tea Scarlett seldom refused no matter how distasteful the idea might be for she always hoped to have an opportunity to suggest tactfully that they do their trading at Franks store But her selfcontrol was severely tested many times because of the personal questions they asked and because of the smug and condescending attitude they displayed toward all things Southern Accepting Uncle Toms Cabin as revelation second only to the Bible the Yankee women all wanted to know about the bloodhounds which every Southerner kept to track down runaway slaves And they never believed her when she told them she had only seen one bloodhound in all her life and it was a small mild dog and not a huge ferocious mastiff They wanted to know about the dreadful branding irons which planters used to mark the faces of their slaves and the catoninetails with which they beat them to death and they evidenced what Scarlett felt was a very nasty and illbred interest in slave concubinage Especially did she resent this in view of the enormous increase in mulatto babies in Atlanta since the Yankee soldiers had settled in the town Any other Atlanta woman would have expired in rage at having to listen to such bigoted ignorance but Scarlett managed to control herself Assisting her in this was the fact that they aroused her contempt more than her anger After all they were Yankees and no one expected anything better from Yankees So their unthinking insults to her state her people and their morals glanced off and never struck deep enough to cause her more than a wellconcealed sneer until an incident occurred which made her sick with rage and showed her if she needed any showing how wide was the gap between North and South and how utterly impossible it was to bridge it While driving home with Uncle Peter one afternoon she passed the house into which were crowded the families of three officers who were building their own homes with Scarletts lumber The three wives were standing in the walk as she drove by and they waved to her to stop Coming out to the carriage block they greeted her in accents that always made her feel that one could forgive Yankees almost anything except their voices You are just the person I want to see Mrs Kennedy said a tall thin woman from Maine I want to get some information about this benighted town Scarlett swallowed the insult to Atlanta with the contempt it deserved and smiled her best And what can I tell you My nurse my Bridget has gone back North She said she wouldnt stay another day down here among the naygurs as she calls them And the children are just driving me distracted Do tell me how to go about getting another nurse I do not know where to apply That shouldnt be difficult said Scarlett and laughed If you can find a darky just in from the country who hasnt been spoiled by the Freedmens Bureau youll have the best kind of servant possible Just stand at your gate here and ask every darky woman who passes and Im sure The three women broke into indignant outcries Do you think Id trust my babies to a black nigger cried the Maine woman I want a good Irish girl Im afraid youll find no Irish servants in Atlanta answered Scarlett coolness in her voice Personally Ive never seen a white servant and I shouldnt care to have one in my house And she could not keep a slight note of sarcasm from her words I assure you that darkies arent cannibals and are quite trustworthy Goodness no I wouldnt have one in my house The idea I wouldnt trust them any farther than I could see them and as for letting them handle my babies  Scarlett thought of the kind gnarled hands of Mammy worn rough in Ellens service and hers and Wades What did these strangers know of black hands how dear and comforting they could be how unerringly they knew how to soothe to pat to fondle She laughed shortly Its strange you should feel that way when it was you all who freed them Lor Not I dearie laughed the Maine woman I never saw a nigger till I came South last month and I dont care if I never see another They give me the creeps I wouldnt trust one of them  For some moments Scarlett had been conscious that Uncle Peter was breathing hard and sitting up very straight as he stared steadily at the horses ears Her attention was called to him more forcibly when the Maine woman broke off suddenly with a laugh and pointed him out to her companions Look at that old nigger swell up like a toad she giggled Ill bet hes an old pet of yours isnt he You Southerners dont know how to treat niggers You spoil them to death Peter sucked in his breath and his wrinkled brow showed deep furrows but he kept his eyes straight ahead He had never had the term nigger applied to him by a white person in all his life By other negroes yes But never by a white person And to be called untrustworthy and an old pet he Peter who had been the dignified mainstay of the Hamilton family for years Scarlett felt rather than saw the black chin begin to shake with hurt pride and a killing rage swept over her She had listened with calm contempt while these women had underrated the Confederate Army blackguarded Jeff Davis and accused Southerners of murder and torture of their slaves If it were to her advantage she would have endured insults about her own virtue and honesty But the knowledge that they had hurt the faithful old darky with their stupid remarks fired her like a match in gunpowder For a moment she looked at the big horse pistol in Peters belt and her hands itched for the feel of it They deserved killing these insolent ignorant arrogant conquerors But she bit down on her teeth until her jaw muscles stood out reminding herself that the time had not yet come when she could tell the Yankees just what she thought of them Some day yes My God yes But not yet Uncle Peter is one of our family she said her voice shaking Good afternoon Drive on Peter Peter laid the whip on the horse so suddenly that the startled animal jumped forward and as the buggy jounced off Scarlett heard the Maine woman say with puzzled accents Her family You dont suppose she meant a relative Hes exceedingly black  Page    Gone With The Wind God damn them They ought to be wiped off the face of the earth If ever I get money enough Ill spit in all their faces Ill She glanced at Peter and saw that a tear was trickling down his nose Instantly a passion of tenderness of grief for his humiliation swamped her made her eyes sting It was as though someone had been senselessly brutal to a child Those women had hurt Uncle PeterPeter who had been through the Mexican War with old Colonel Hamilton Peter who had held his master in his arms when he died who had raised Melly and Charles and looked after the feckless foolish Pittypat pertecked her when she refugeed and  quired a horse to bring her back from Macon through a wartorn country after the surrender And they said they wouldnt trust niggers Peter she said her voice breaking as she put her hand on his thin arm Im ashamed of you for crying What do you care They arent anything but damned Yankees Dey talked in front of me lak Ah wuz a mule an couldn unnerstan demlak Ah wuz a Affikun an din know whut dey wuz talkin bout said Peter giving a tremendous sniff An dey call me a nigger an Ah ain never been call a nigger by no wite folks an dey call me a ole pet an say dat niggers ain ter be trused Me not ter be trused Why wen de ole Cunnel wuz dyin he say ter me You Peter You look affer mah chillun Tek keer of yo young Miss Pittypat he say  cause she ain got no mo sense dan a hoppergrass An Ah done tek keer of her good all dese yars Nobody but the Angel Gabriel could have done better said Scarlett soothingly We just couldnt have lived without you Yasm thankee kinely Mam Ah knows it an you knows it but dem Yankee folks doan know it an dey doan want ter know it Huccome dey come mixin in our bizness Miss Scarlett Dey doan unnerstan us Confedruts Scarlett said nothing for she was still burning with the wrath she had not exploded in the Yankee womens faces The two drove home in silence Peters sniffles stopped and his underlip began to protrude gradually until it stuck out alarmingly His indignation was mounting now that the initial hurt was subsiding Scarlett thought What damnably queer people Yankees are Those women seemed to think that because Uncle Peter was black he had no ears to hear with and no feelings as tender as their own to be hurt They did not know that negroes had to be handled gently as though they were children directed praised petted scolded They didnt understand negroes or the relations between the negroes and their former masters Yet they had fought a war to free them And having freed them they didnt want to have anything to do with them except to use them to terrorize Southerners They didnt like them didnt trust them didnt understand them and yet their constant cry was that Southerners didnt know how to get along with them Not trust a darky Scarlett trusted them far more than most white people certainly more than she trusted any Yankee There were qualities of loyalty and tirelessness and love in them that no strain could break no money could buy She thought of the faithful few who remained at Tara in the face of the Yankee invasion when they could have fled or joined the troops for lives of leisure But they had stayed She thought of Dilcey toiling in the cotton fields beside her of Pork risking his life in neighboring hen houses that the family might eat of Mammy coming to Atlanta with her to keep her from doing wrong She thought of the servants of her neighbors who had stood loyally beside their white owners protecting their mistresses while the men were at the front refugeeing with them through the terrors of the war nursing the wounded burying the dead comforting the bereaved working begging stealing to keep food on the tables And even now with the Freedmens Bureau promising all manner of wonders they still stuck with their white folks and worked much harder than they ever worked in slave times But the Yankees didnt understand these things and would never understand them Yet they set you free she said aloud No Mam Dey din sot me free Ah wouldn let no sech trash sot me free said Peter indignantly Ah still blongs ter Miss Pitty an wen Ah dies she gwine lay me in de Hamilton buhyin groun whar Ah blongs  Mah Miss gwine ter be in a state wen Ah tells her bout how you let dem Yankee women sult me I did no such thing cried Scarlett startled You did so Miss Scarlett said Peter pushing out his lip even farther De pint is needer you nor me had no bizness bein wid Yankees so dey could sult me Ef you hadnt talked wid dem dey wouldn had no chance ter treat me lak a mule or a Affikun An you din tek up fer me needer I did too said Scarlett stung by the criticism Didnt I tell them you were one of the family Dat ain tekkin up Dats jes a fac said Peter Miss Scarlett you ain got no bizness havin no truck wid Yankees Ain no other ladies doin it You wouldn ketch Miss Pitty wipin her lil shoes on sech trash An she ain gwine lake it wen she hear bout whut dey said bout me Peters criticism hurt worse than anything Frank or Aunt Pitty or the neighbors had said and it so annoyed her she longed to shake the old darky until his toothless gums clapped together What Peter said was true but she hated to hear it from a negro and a family negro too Not to stand high in the opinion of ones servants was as humiliating a thing as could happen to a Southerner A ole pet Peter grumbled Ah specs Miss Pitty aint gwine want me ter drive you roun no mo after dat No Mam Aunt Pitty will want you to drive me as usual she said sternly so lets hear no more about it Ahll git a mizry in mah back warned Peter darkly Mah back huttin me so bad dis minute Ah kain sceercely set up Mah Miss ain gwine want me ter do no drivin wen Ah got a mizry  Miss Scarlett it ain gwine do you no good ter stan high wid de Yankees an de wite trash ef yo own folks doan prove of you That was as accurate a summing up of the situation as could be made and Scarlett relapsed into infuriated silence Yes the conquerors did approve of her and her family and her neighbors did not She knew all the things the town was saying about her And now even Peter disapproved of her to the point of not caring to be seen in public with her That was the last straw Heretofore she had been careless of public opinion careless and a little contemptuous But Peters words caused fierce resentment to burn in her breast drove her to a defensive position made her suddenly dislike her neighbors as much as she disliked the Yankees Why should they care what I do she thought They must think I enjoy associating with Yankees and working like a field hand Theyre just making a hard job harder for me But I dont care what they think I wont let myself care I cant afford to care  Page    Gone With The Wind now But some daysome day Oh some day When there was security in her world again then she would sit back and fold her hands and be a great lady as Ellen had been She would be helpless and sheltered as a lady should be and then everyone would approve of her Oh how grand she would be when she had money again Then she could permit herself to be kind and gentle as Ellen had been and thoughtful of other people and of the proprieties too She would not be driven by fears day and night and life would be a placid unhurried affair She would have time to play with her children and listen to their lessons There would be long warm afternoons when ladies would call and amid the rustlings of taffeta petticoats and the rhythmic harsh cracklings of palmetto fans she would serve tea and delicious sandwiches and cakes and leisurely gossip the hours away And she would be so kind to those who were suffer ing misfortune take baskets to the poor and soup and jelly to the sick and air those less fortunate in her fine carriage She would be a lady in the true Southern manner as her mother had been And then everyone would love her as they had loved Ellen and they would say how unselfish she was and call her Lady Bountiful Her pleasure in these thoughts of the future was undimmed by any realization that she had no real desire to be unselfish or charitable or kind All she wanted was the reputation for possessing these qualities But the meshes of her brain were too wide too coarse to filter such small differences It was enough that some day when she had money everyone would approve of her Some day But not now Not now in spite of what anyone might say of her Now there was no time to be a great lady Peter was as good as his word Aunt Pitty did get into a state and Peters misery developed overnight to such proportions that he never drove the buggy again Thereafter Scarlett drove alone and the calluses which had begun to leave her palms came back again So the spring months went by the cool rains of April passing into the warm balm of green May weather The weeks were packed with work and worry and the handicaps of increasing pregnancy with old friends growing cooler and her family increasingly more kind more maddeningly solicitous and more completely blind to what was driving her During those days of anxiety and struggle there was only one dependable understanding person in her world and that person was Rhett Butler It was odd that he of all people should appear in this light for he was as unstable as quicksilver and as perverse as a demon fresh from the pit But he gave her sympathy something she had never had from anyone and never expected from him Frequently he was out of town on those mysterious trips to New Orleans which he never explained but which she felt sure in a faintly jealous way were connected with a womanor women But after Uncle Peters refusal to drive her he remained in Atlanta for longer and longer intervals While in town he spent most of his time gambling in the rooms above the Girl of the Period Saloon or in Belle Watlings bar hobnobbing with the wealthier of the Yankees and Carpetbaggers in moneymaking schemes which made the townspeople detest him even more than his cronies He did not call at the house now probably in deference to the feelings of Frank and Pitty who would have been outraged at a male caller while Scarlett was in a delicate condition But she met him by accident almost every day Time and again he came riding up to her buggy when she was passing through lonely stretches of Peachtree road and Decatur road where the mills lay He always drew rein and talked and sometimes he tied his horse to the back of the buggy and drove her on her rounds She tired more easily these days than she liked to admit and she was always silently grateful when he took the reins He always left her before they reached the town again but all Atlanta knew about their meetings and it gave the gossips something new to add to the long list of Scarletts affronts to the proprieties She wondered occasionally if these meetings were not more than accidental They became more and more numerous as the weeks went by and as the tension in town heightened over negro outrages But why did he seek her out now of all times when she looked her worst Certainly he had no designs upon her if he had ever had any and she was beginning to doubt even this It had been months since he made any joking references to their distressing scene at the Yankee jail He never mentioned Ashley and her love for him or made any coarse and illbred remarks about coveting her She thought it best to let sleeping dogs lie so she did not ask for an explanation of their frequent meetings And finally she decided that because he had little to do besides gamble and had few enough nice friends in Atlanta he sought her out solely for companionships sake Whatever his reason might be she found his company most welcome He listened to her moans about lost customers and bad debts the swindling ways of Mr Johnson and the incompetency of Hugh He applauded her triumphs where Frank merely smiled indulgently and Pitty said Dear me in a dazed manner She was sure that rich Yankees and Carpetbaggers intimately but he always denied being helpful She knew him for what he was and she never trusted him but her spirits always rose with pleasure at the sight of him riding around the curve of a shady road on his big black horse When he climbed into the buggy and took the reins from her and threw her some impertinent remark she felt young and gay and attractive again for an her worries and her increasing bulk She could talk to him about almost everything with no care for concealing her motives or her real opinions and she never ran out of things to say as she did with Frankor even with Ashley if she must be honest with herself But of course in all her conversations with Ashley there were so many things which could not be said for honors sake that the sheer force of them inhibited other remarks It was comforting to have a friend like Rhett now that for some unaccountable reason he had decided to be on good behavior with her Very comforting for she had so few friends these days Rhett she asked stormily shortly after Uncle Peters ultimatum why do folks in this town treat me so scurvily and talk about me so Its a tossup who they talk worst about me or the Carpetbaggers Ive minded my own business and havent done anything wrong and If you havent done anything wrong its because you havent had the opportunity and perhaps they dimly realize it Oh do be serious They make me so mad All Ive done is try to make a little money and All youve done is to be different from other women and youve made a little success at it As Ive told you before that is the one unforgivable sin in any society Be different and be damned Scarlett the mere fact that youve made a success of your mill is an insult to every man who hasnt succeeded Remember a wellbred females place is in the home and she should know nothing about this busy brutal world But if I had stayed in my home I wouldnt have had any home left to stay in The inference is that you should have starved genteelly and with pride  Page    Gone With The Wind Oh fiddledeedee But look at Mrs Merriwether Shes selling pies to Yankees and thats worse than running a sawmill and Mrs Elsing takes in sewing and keeps boarders and Fanny paints awfullooking china things that nobody wants and everybody buys to help her and But you miss the point my pet They arent successful and so they arent affronting the hot Southern pride of their men folks The men can still say Poor sweet sillies how hard they try Well Ill let them think theyre helping And besides the ladies you mentioned dont enjoy having to work They let it be known that they are only doing it until some man conies along to relieve them of their unwomanly burdens And so everybody feels sorry for them But obviously you do like to work and obviously you arent going to let any man tend to your business for you and so no one can feel sorry for you And Atlanta is never going to forgive you for that Its so pleasant to feel sorry for people I wish youd be serious sometimes Did you ever hear the Oriental proverb The dogs bark but the caravan passes on Let them bark Scarlett I fear nothing will stop your caravan But why should they mind my making a little money You cant have everything Scarlett You can either make money in your present unladylike manner and meet cold shoulders everywhere you go or you can be poor and genteel and have lots of friends Youve made your choice I wont be poor she said swiftly Butit is the right choice isnt it If its money you want most Yes I want money more than anything else in the world Then youve made the only choice But theres a penalty attached as there is to most things you want Its loneliness That silenced her for a moment It was true When she stopped to think about it she was a little lonelylonely for feminine companionship During the war years she had had Ellen to visit when she felt blue And since Ellens death there had always been Melanie though she and Melanie had nothing in common except the hard work at Tara Now there was no one for Aunt Pitty had no conception of life beyond her small round of gossip I thinkI think she began hesitantly that Ive always been lonely where women were concerned It isnt just my working that makes Atlanta ladies dislike me They just dont like me anyway No woman ever really liked me except Mother Even my sisters I dont know why but even before the war even before I married Charlie ladies didnt seem to approve of anything I did You forget Mrs Wilkes said Rhett and his eyes gleamed maliciously She has always approved of you up to the hilt I daresay shed approve of anything you did short of murder Scarlett thought grimly Shes even approved of murder and she laughed contemptuously Oh Melly she said and then ruefully Its certainly not to my credit that Melly is the only woman who approves of me for she hasnt the sense of a guinea hen If she had any sense She stopped in some confusion If she had any sense shed realize a few things and she couldnt approve Rhett finished Well you know more about that than I do of course Oh damn your memory and your bad manners Ill pass over your unjustified rudeness with the silence it deserves and return to our former subject Make up your mind to this If you are different you are isolated not only from people of your own age but from those of your parents generation and from your childrens generation too Theyll never understand you and theyll be shocked no matter what you do But your grandparents would probably be proud of you and say Theres a chip off the old block and your grandchildren will sigh enviously and say What an old rip Grandma must have been and theyll try to be like you Scarlett laughed with amusement Sometimes you do hit on the truth Now there was my Grandma Robillard Mammy used to hold her over my head whenever I was naughty Grandma was as cold as an icicle and strict about her manners and everybody elses manners but she married three times and had any number of duels fought over her and she wore rouge and the most shockingly lowcut dresses and nowell ernot much under her dresses And you admired her tremendously for all that you tried to be like your mother I had a grandfather on the Butler side who was a pirate Not really A walktheplank kind I daresay he made people walk the plank if there was any money to be made that way At any rate he made enough money to leave my father quite wealthy But the family always referred to him carefully as a sea captain He was killed in a saloon brawl long before I was born His death was needless to say a great relief to his children for the old gentleman was drunk most of the time and when in his cups was apt to forget that he was a retired sea captain and give reminiscences that curled his childrens hair However I admired him and tried to copy him far more than I ever did my father for Father is an amiable gentleman full of honorable habits and pious sawsso you see how it goes Im sure your children wont approve of you Scarlett any more than Mrs Merriwether and Mrs Elsing and their broods approve of you now Your children will probably be soft prissy creatures as the children of hardbitten characters usually are And to make them worse you like every other mother are probably determined that they shall never know the hardships youve known And thats all wrong Hardships make or break people So youll have to wait for approval from your grandchildren I wonder what our grandchildren will be like Are you suggesting by that our that you and I will have mutual grandchildren Fie Mrs Kennedy Scarlett suddenly conscious of her error of speech went red It was more than his joking words that shamed her for she was suddenly aware again of her thickening body In no way had either of them ever hinted at her condition and she had always kept the lap robe high under her armpits when with him even on warm days comforting herself in the usual feminine manner with the belief that she did not show at all when thus covered and she was suddenly sick with quick rage at her own condition and shame that he should know  Page    Gone With The Wind You get out of this buggy you dirtyminded varmint she said her voice shaking Ill do nothing of the kind he returned calmly Itll be dark before you get home and theres a new colony of darkies living in tents and shanties near the next spring mean niggers Ive been told and I see no reason why you should give the impulsive Ku Klux a cause for putting on their nightshirts and riding abroad this evening Get out she cried tugging at the reins and suddenly nausea overwhelmed her He stopped the horse quickly passed her two clean handkerchiefs and held her head over the side of the buggy with some skill The afternoon sun slanting low through the newly leaved trees spun sickeningly for a few moments in a swirl of gold and green When the spell had passed she put her head in her hands and cried from sheer mortification Not only had she vomited before a manin itself as horrible a contretemps as could overtake a womanbut by doing so the humiliating fact of her pregnancy must now be evident She felt that she could never look him in the face again To have this happen with him of all people with Rhett who had no respect for women She cried expecting some coarse and jocular remark from him which she would never be able to forget Dont be a fool he said quietly And you are a fool if you are crying for shame Come Scarlett dont be a child Surely you must know that not being blind I knew you were pregnant She said Oh in a stunned voice and tightened her fingers over her crimson face The word itself horrified her Frank always referred to her pregnancy embarrassedly as your condition Gerald had been wont to say delicately in the family way when he had to mention such matters and ladies genteelly referred to pregnancy as being in a fix You are a child if you thought I didnt know for all your smothering yourself under that hot lap robe Of course I knew Why else do you think Ive been He stopped suddenly and a silence fell between them He picked up the reins and clucked to the horse He went on talking quietly and as his drawl fell pleasantly on her ears some of the color faded from her downtucked face I didnt think you could be so shocked Scarlett I thought you were a sensible person and Im disappointed Can it be possible that modesty still lingers in your breast Im afraid Im not a gentleman to have mentioned the matter And I know Im not a gentleman in view of the fact that pregnant women do not embarrass me as they should I find it possible to treat them as normal creatures and not look at the ground or the sky or anywhere else in the universe except their waist linesand then cast at them those furtive glances Ive always thought the height of indecency Why should I Its a perfectly normal state The Europeans are far more sensible than we are They compliment expectant mothers upon their expectations While I wouldnt advise going that far still its more sensible than our way of trying to ignore it Its a normal state and women should be proud of it instead of hiding behind closed doors as if theyd committed a crime Proud she cried in a strangled voice Proudugh Arent you proud to be having a child Oh dear God no II hate babies You meanFranks baby Noanybodys baby For a moment she went sick again at this new error of speech but his voice went on as easily as though he had not marked it Then were different I like babies You like them she cried looking up so startled at the statement that she forgot her embarrassment What a liar you are I like babies and I like little children till they begin to grow up and acquire adult habits of thought and adult abilities to lie and cheat and be dirty That cant be news to you You know I like Wade Hampton a lot for all that he isnt the boy he ought to be That was true thought Scarlett suddenly marveling He did seem to enjoy playing with Wade and often brought him presents Now that weve brought this dreadful subject into the light and you admit that you expect a baby some time in the not too distant future Ill say something Ive been wanting to say for weekstwo things The first is that its dangerous for you to drive alone You know it Youve been told it often enough If you dont care personally whether or not you are raped you might consider the consequences Because of your obstinacy you may get yourself into a situation where your gallant fellow townsmen will be forced to avenge you by stringing up a few darkies And that will bring the Yankees down on them and someone will probably get hanged Has it ever occurred to you that perhaps one of the reasons the ladies do not like you is that your conduct may cause the neckstretching of their sons and husbands And furthermore if the Ku Klux handles many more negroes the Yankees are going to tighten up on Atlanta in a way that will make Shermans conduct look angelic I know what Im talking about for Im hand in glove with the Yankees Shameful to state they treat me as one of them and I hear them talk openly They mean to stamp out the Ku Klux if it means burning the whole town again and hanging every male over ten That would hurt you Scarlett You might lose money And theres no telling where a prairie fire will stop once it gets started Confiscation of property higher taxes fines for suspected womenIve heard them all suggested The Ku Klux Do you know any Ku Klux Is Tommy Wellburn or Hugh or He shrugged impatiently How should I know Im a renegade a turncoat a Scalawag Would I be likely to know But I do know men who are suspected by the Yankees and one false move from them and they are as good as hanged While I know you would have no regrets at getting your neighbors on the gallows I do believe youd regret losing your mills I see by the stubborn look on your face that you do not believe me and my words are falling on stony ground So all I can say is keep that pistol of yours handyand when Im in town Ill try to be on hand to drive you Rhett do you reallyis it to protect me that you Yes my dear it is my much advertised chivalry that makes me protect you The mocking light began to dance in his black eyes and all signs of earnestness fled from his face And why Because of my deep love for you Mrs Kennedy Yes I have silently hungered and thirsted for you and worshipped you from afar but being an honorable man like Mr Ashley Wilkes I have concealed it from you You are alas Franks wife and honor has forbidden my telling this to you But even as Mr Wilkes honor cracks occasionally so mine is cracking now and I reveal my secret passion and my Oh for Gods sake hush interrupted Scarlett annoyed as usual when he made her look like a conceited fool and not caring  Page    Gone With The Wind to have Ashley and his honor become the subject of further conversation What was the other thing you wanted to tell me What You change the subject when I am baring a loving but lacerated heart Well the other thing is this The mocking light died out of his eyes again and his face was dark and quiet I want you to do something about this horse Hes stubborn and hes got a mouth as tough as iron Tires you to drive him doesnt it Well if he chose to bolt you couldnt possibly stop him And if you turned over in a ditch it might kill your baby and you too You ought to get the heaviest curb bit you can or else let me swap him for a gentle horse with a more sensitive mouth She looked up into his blank smooth face and suddenly her irritation fell away even as her embarrassment had disappeared after the conversation about her pregnancy He had been kind a few moments before to put her at her ease when she was wishing that she were dead And he was being kinder now and very thoughtful about the horse She felt a rush of gratitude to him and she wondered why he could not always be this way The horse is hard to drive she agreed meekly Sometimes my arms ache all night from tugging at him You do what you think best about him Rhett His eyes sparkled wickedly That sounds very sweet and feminine Mrs Kennedy Not in your usual masterful vein at all Well it only takes proper handling to make a clinging vine out of you She scowled and her temper came back You will get out of this buggy this time or I will hit you with the whip I dont know why I put up with youwhy I try to be nice to you You have no manners You have no morals You are nothing but a Well get out I mean it But when he had climbed down and untied his horse from the back of the buggy and stood in the twilight road grinning tantalizingly at her she could not smother her own grin as she drove off Yes he was coarse he was tricky he was unsafe to have dealings with and you never could tell when the dull weapon you put into his hands in an unguarded moment might turn into the keenest of blades But after all he was as stimulating aswell as a surreptitious glass of brandy During these months Scarlett had learned the use of brandy When she came home in the late afternoons damp from the rain cramped and aching from long hours in the buggy nothing sustained her except the thought of the bottle hidden in her top bureau drawer locked against Mammys prying eyes Dr Meade had not thought to warn her that a woman in her condition should not drink for it never occurred to him that a decent woman would drink anything stronger than scuppernong wine Except of course a glass of champagne at a wedding or a hot toddy when confined to bed with a hard cold Of course there were unfortunate women who drank to the eternal disgrace of their families just as there were women who were insane or divorced or who believed with Miss Susan B Anthony that women should have the vote But as much as the doctor disapproved of Scarlett he never suspected her of drinking Scarlett had found that a drink of neat brandy before supper helped immeasurably and she would always chew coffee or gargle cologne to disguise the smell Why were people so silly about women drinking when men could and did get reeling drunk whenever they wanted to Sometimes when Frank lay snoring beside her and sleep would not come when she lay tossing torn with fears of poverty dreading the Yankees homesick for Tara and yearning for Ashley she thought she would go crazy were it not for the brandy bottle And when the pleasant familiar warmth stole through her veins her troubles began to fade After three drinks she could always say to herself Ill think of these things tomorrow when I can stand them better But there were some nights when even brandy would not still the ache in her heart the ache that was even stronger than fear of losing the mills the ache to see Tara again Atlanta with its noises its new buildings its strange faces its narrow streets crowded with horses and wagons and bustling crowds sometimes seemed to stifle her She loved Atlanta butoh for the sweet peace and country quiet of Tara the red fields and the dark pines about it Oh to be back at Tara no matter how hard the life might be And to be near Ashley just to see him to hear him speak to be sustained by the knowledge of his love Each letter from Melanie saying that they were well each brief note from Will reporting about the plowing the planting the growing of the cotton made her long anew to be home again Ill go home in June I cant do anything here after that Ill go home for a couple of months she thought and her heart would rise She did go home in June but not as she longed to go for early in that month came a brief message from Will that Gerald was dead CHAPTER XXXIX THE TRAIN was very late and the long deeply blue twilight of June was settling over the countryside when Scarlett alighted in Jonesboro Yellow gleams of lamplight showed in the stores and houses which remained in the village but they were few Here and there were wide gaps between the buildings on the main street where dwellings had been shelled or burned Ruined houses with shell holes in their roofs and half the walls torn away stared at her silent and dark A few saddle horses and mule teams were hitched outside the wooden awning of Bullards store The dusty red road was empty and lifeless and the only sounds in the village were a few whoops and drunken laughs that floated on the still twilight air from a saloon far down the street The depot had not been rebuilt since it was burned in the battle and in its place was only a wooden shelter with no sides to keep out the weather Scarlett walked under it and sat down on one of the empty kegs that were evidently put there for seats She peered up and down the street for Will Benteen Will should have been here to meet her He should have known she would take the first tram possible after receiving his laconic message that Gerald was dead She had come so hurriedly that she had in her small carpetbag only a nightgown and a tooth brush not even a change of underwear She was uncomfortable in the tight black dress she had borrowed from Mrs Meade for she had had no time to get mourning clothes for herself Mrs Meade was thin now and Scarletts pregnancy being advanced the dress was doubly uncomfortable Even in her sorrow at Geralds death she did not forget the appearance she was making and she looked down at her body with distaste Her figure was completely gone and her face and ankles were puffy Heretofore she had not cared very  Page    Gone With The Wind much how she looked but now that she would see Ashley within the hour she cared greatly Even in her heartbreak she shrank from the thought of facing him when she was carrying another mans child She loved him and he loved her and this unwanted child now seemed to her a proof of infidelity to that love But much as she disliked having him see her with the slenderness gone from her waist and the lightness from her step it was something she could not escape now She patted her foot impatiently Will should have met her Of course she could go over to Bullards and inquire after him or ask someone there to drive her over to Tara should she find he had been unable to come But she did not want to go to Bullards It was Saturday night and probably half the men of the County would be there She did not want to display her condition in this poorly fitting black dress which accentuated rather than hid her figure And she did not want to hear the kindly sympathy that would be poured out about Gerald She did not want sympathy She was afraid she would cry if anyone even mentioned his name to her And she wouldnt cry She knew if she once began it would be like the time she cried into the horses mane that dreadful night when Atlanta fell and Rhett had left her on the dark road outside the town terrible tears that tore her heart and could not be stopped No she wouldnt cry She felt the lump in her throat rising again as it had done so often since the news came but crying wouldnt do any good It would only confuse and weaken her Why oh why hadnt Will or Melanie or the girls written her that Gerald was ailing She would have taken the first train to Tara to care for him brought a doctor from Atlanta if necessary The foolsall of them Couldnt they manage anything without her She couldnt be in two places at once and the good Lord knew she was doing her best for them all in Atlanta She twisted about on the keg becoming nervous and fidgety as Will still did not come Where was he Then she heard the scrunching of cinders on the railroad tracks behind her and twisting her body she saw Alex Fontaine crossing the tracks toward a wagon a sack of oats on his shoulder Good Lord Isnt that you Scarlett he cried dropping the sack and running to take her hand pleasure written all over his bitter swarthy little face Im so glad to see you I saw Will over at the blacksmiths shop getting the horse shod The train was late and he thought hed have time Shall I run fetch him Yes please Alex she said smiling in spite of her sorrow It was good to see a County face again OherScarlett he began awkwardly still holding her hand Im mighty sorry about your father Thank you she replied wishing he had not said it His words brought up Geralds florid face and bellowing voice so clearly If its any comfort to you Scarlett were mighty proud of him around here Alex continued dropping her hand Hewell we figure he died like a soldier and in a soldiers cause Now what did he mean by that she thought confusedly A soldier Had someone shot him Had he gotten into a fight with the Scalawags as Tony had But she mustnt hear more She would cry if she talked about him and she mustnt cry not until she was safely in the wagon with Will and out in the country where no stranger could see her Will wouldnt matter He was just like a brother Alex I dont want to talk about it she said shortly I dont blame you one bit Scarlett said Alex while the dark blood of anger flooded his face If it was my sister Idwell Scarlett Ive never yet said a harsh word about any woman but personally I think somebody ought to take a rawhide whip to Suellen What foolishness was he talking about now she wondered What had Suellen to do with it all Everybody around here feels the same way about her Im sorry to say Wills the only one who takes up for herand of course Miss Melanie but shes a saint and wont see bad in anyone and I said I didnt want to talk about it she said coldly but Alex did not seem rebuffed He looked as though he understood her rudeness and that was annoying She didnt want to hear bad tidings about her own family from an outsider didnt want him to know of her ignorance of what had happened Why hadnt Will sent her the full details She wished Alex wouldnt look at her so hard She felt that he realized her condition and it embarrassed her But what Alex was thinking as he peered at her in the twilight was that her face had changed so completely he wondered how he had ever recognized her Perhaps it was because she was going to have a baby Women did look like the devil at such times And of course she must be feeling badly about old man OHara She had been his pet But no the change was deeper than that She really looked as if she had three square meals a day And the huntedanimal look had partly gone from her eyes Now the eyes which had been fearful and desperate were hard There was an air of command assurance and determination about her even when she smiled Bet she led old Frank a merry life Yes she had changed She was a handsome woman to be sure but all that pretty sweet softness had gone from her face and that flattering way of looking up at a man like he knew more than God Almighty had utterly vanished Well hadnt they all changed Alex looked down at his rough clothes and his face fell into its usual bitter lines Sometimes at night when he lay awake wondering how his mother was going to get that operation and how poor dead Joes little boy was going to get an education and how he was going to get money for another mule he wished the war was still going on wished it had gone on forever They didnt know their luck then There was always something to eat in the army even if it was just corn bread always somebody to give orders and none of this torturing sense of facing problems that couldnt be solvednothing to bother about in the army except getting killed And then there was Dimity Munroe Alex wanted to marry her and he knew he couldnt when so many were already looking to him for support He had loved her for so long and now the roses were fading from her cheeks and the joy from her eyes If only Tony hadnt had to run away to Texas Another man on the place would make all the difference in the world His lovable badtempered little brother penniless somewhere in the West Yes they had all changed And why not He sighed heavily I havent thanked you for what you and Frank did for Tony he said It was you who helped him get away wasnt it It was fine of you I heard in a roundabout way that he was safe in Texas I was afraid to write and ask youbut did you or Frank lend him any money I want to repay Oh Alex please hush Not now cried Scarlett For once money meant nothing to her Alex was silent for a moment  Page    Gone With The Wind Ill get Will for you he said and well all be over tomorrow for the funeral As he picked up the sack of oats and turned away a wobblywheeled wagon swayed out of a side street and creaked up to them Will called from the seat Im sorry Im late Scarlett Climbing awkwardly down from the wagon he stumped toward her and bending kissed her cheek Will had never kissed her before had never failed to precede her name with Miss and while it surprised her it warmed her heart and pleased her very much He lifted her carefully over the wheel and into the wagon and looking down she saw that it was the same old rickety wagon in which she had fled from Atlanta How had it ever held together so long Will must have kept it patched up very well It made her slightly sick to look at it and to remember that night If it took the shoes off her feet or food from Aunt Pittys table shed see that there was a new wagon at Tara and this one burned Will did not speak at first and Scarlett was grateful He threw his battered straw hat into the back of the wagon clucked to the horse and they moved off Will was just the same lank and gangling pink of hair mild of eye patient as a draft animal They left the village behind and turned into the red road to Tara A faint pink still lingered about the edges of the sky and fat feathery clouds were tinged with gold and palest green The stillness of the country twilight came down about them as calming as a prayer How had she ever borne it she thought away for all these months away from the fresh smell of country air the plowed earth and the sweetness of summer nights The moist red earth smelled so good so familiar so friendly she wanted to get out and scoop up a handful The honeysuckle which draped the gullied red sides of the road in tangled greenery was piercingly fragrant as always after rain the sweetest perfume in the world Above their heads a flock of chimney swallows whirled suddenly on swift wings and now and then a rabbit scurried startled across the road his white tail bobbing like an eiderdown powder puff She saw with pleasure that the cotton stood well as they passed between plowed fields where the green bushes reared themselves sturdily out of the red earth How beautiful all this was The soft gray mist in the swampy bottoms the red earth and growing cotton the sloping fields with curving green rows and the black pines rising behind everything like sable walls How had she ever stayed in Atlanta so long Scarlett before I tell you about Mr OHaraand I want to tell you everything before you get homeI want to ask your opinion on a matter I figger youre the head of the house now What is it Will He turned his mild sober gaze on her for a moment I just wanted your approval to my marryin Suellen Scarlett clutched the seat so surprised that she almost fell backwards Marry Suellen Shed never thought of anybody marrying Suellen since she had taken Frank Kennedy from her Who would have Suellen Goodness Will Then I take it you dont mind Mind No but Why Will youve taken my breath away You marry Suellen Will I always thought you were sweet on Carreen Will kept his eyes on the horse and flapped the reins His profile did not change but she thought he sighed slightly Maybe I was he said Well wont she have you I never asked her Oh Will youre a fool Ask her Shes worth two of Suellen Scarlett you dont know a lot of things thats been going on at Tara You aint favored us with much of your attention these last months I havent havent I she flared What do you suppose Ive been doing in Atlanta Riding around in a coach and four and going to balls Havent I sent you money every month Havent I paid the taxes and fixed the roof and bought the new plow and the mules Havent Now dont fly off the handle and get your Irish up he interrupted imperturbably If anybody knows what youve done I do and its been two mens work Slightly mollified she questioned Well then what do you mean Well youve kept the roof over us and food in the pantry and I aint denyin that but you aint given much thought to whats been goin on in anybodys head here at Tara I aint blamin you Scarlett Thats just your way You warnt never very much interested in what was in folks heads But what Im tryin to tell you is that I didnt never ask Miss Carreen because I knew it wouldnt be no use Shes been like a little sister to me and I guess she talks to me plainer than to anybody in the world But she never got over that dead boy and she never will And I might as well tell you now shes aimin to go in a convent over to Charleston Are you joking Well I knew it would take you back and I just want to ask you Scarlett dont you argue with her about it or scold her or laugh at her Let her go Its all she wants now Her hearts broken But Gods nightgown Lots of peoples hearts have been broken and they didnt run off to convents Look at me I lost a husband But your heart warnt broken Will said calmly and picking up a straw from the bottom of the wagon he put it in his mouth and chewed slowly That remark took the wind out of her As always when she heard the truth spoken no matter how unpalatable it was basic honesty forced her to acknowledge it as truth She was silent a moment trying to accustom herself to the idea of Carreen as a nun Promise you wont fuss at her Oh well I promise and then she looked at him with a new understanding and some amazement Will had loved Carreen loved her now enough to take her part and make her retreat easy And yet he wanted to marry Suellen Well whats all this about Suellen You dont care for her do you  Page    Gone With The Wind Oh yes I do in a way he said removing the straw and surveying it as if it were highly interesting Suellen aint as bad as you think Scarlett I think well get along right well The only trouble with Suellen is that she needs a husband and some children and thats just what every woman needs The wagon jolted over the rutty road and for a few minutes while the two sat silent Scarletts mind was busy There must be something more to it than appeared on the surface something deeper more important to make the mild and softspoken Will want to marry a complaining nagger like Suellen You havent told me the real reason Will If Im head of the family Ive got a right to know Thats right said Will and I guess youll understand I cant leave Tara Its home to me Scarlett the only real home I ever knew and I love every stone of it Ive worked on it like it was mine And when you put out work on somethin you come to love it You know what I mean She knew what he meant and her heart went out in a surge of warm affection for him hearing him say he too loved the thing she loved best And I figger it this way With your pa gone and Carreen a nun therell be just me and Suellen left here and of course I couldnt live on at Tara without marryin Suellen You know how folks talk Butbut Will theres Melanie and Ashley At Ashleys name he turned and looked at her his pale eyes unfathomable She had the old feeling that Will knew all about her and Ashley understood all and did not either censure or approve Theyll be goin soon Going Where Tara is their home as well as yours No it aint their home Thats just whats eatin on Ashley It aint his home and he dont feel like hes earnin his keep Hes a mighty pore farmer and he knows it God knows he tries his best but he warnt cut out for farmin and you know it as well as I do If he splits kindlin like as not hell slice off his foot He cant no more keep a plow straight in a furrow than little Beau can and what he dont know about makin things grow would fill a book It aint his fault He just warnt bred for it And it worries him that hes a man livin at Tara on a womans charity and not givin much in return Charity Has he ever said No hes never said a word You know Ashley But I can tell Last night when we were sittin up with your pa I tole him I had asked Suellen and shed said Yes And then Ashley said that relieved him because hed been feelin like a dog stayin on at Tara and he knew he and Miss Melly would have to keep stayin on now that Mr OHara was dead just to keep folks from talkin about me and Suellen So then he told me he was aimin to leave Tara and get work Work What kind Where I dont know exactly what hell do but he said he was goin up North Hes got a Yankee friend in New York who wrote him about workin in a bank up there Oh no cried Scarlett from the bottom of her heart and at the cry Will gave her the same look as before Maybe twould be better all round if he did go North No No I dont think so Her mind was working feverishly Ashley couldnt go North She might never see him again Even though she had not seen him in months had not spoken to him alone since that fateful scene in the orchard there had not been a day when she had not thought of him been glad he was sheltered under her roof She had never sent a dollar to Will that she had not been pleased that it would make Ashleys life easier Of course he wasnt any good as a farmer Ashley was bred for better things she thought proudly He was born to rule to live in a large house ride fine horses read books of poetry and tell negroes what to do That there were no more mansions and horses and negroes and few books did not alter matters Ashley wasnt bred to plow and split rails No wonder he wanted to leave Tara But she could not let him go away from Georgia If necessary she would bully Frank into giving him a job in the store make Frank turn off the boy he now had behind the counter But noAshleys place was no more behind a counter than it was behind a plow A Wilkes a shopkeeper Oh never that There must be somethingwhy her mill of course Her relief at the thought was so great that she smiled But would he accept an offer from her Would he still think it was charity She must manage it so he would think he was doing her a favor She would discharge Mr Johnson and put Ashley in charge of the old mill while Hugh operated the new one She would explain to Ashley how Franks ill health and the pressure of work at the store kept him from helping her and she would plead her condition as another reason why she needed his help She would make him realize somehow that she couldnt do without his aid at this time And she would give him a halfinterest in the mill if he would only take it overanything just to have him near her anything to see that bright smile light up his face anything for the chance of catching an unguarded look in his eyes that showed he still cared But she promised herself never never would she again try to prod him into words of love never again would she try to make him throw away that foolish honor he valued more than love Somehow she must delicately convey to him this new resolution of hers Otherwise he might refuse fearing another scene such as that last terrible one had been I can get him something to do in Atlanta she said Well thats yours and Ashleys business said Will and put the straw back in his mouth Giddap Sherman Now Scarlett theres somethin else Ive got to ask you before I tell you about your pa I wont have you lightin into Suellen What shes done shes done and you snatchin her baldheaded wont bring Mr OHara back Besides she honestly thought she was actin for the best I wanted to ask you about that What is all this about Suellen Alex talked riddles and said she ought to be whipped What has she done Yes folks are pretty riled up about her Everybody I run into this afternoon in Jonesboro was promisin to cut her dead the next time they seen her but maybe theyll get over it Now promise me you wont light into her I wont be havin no quarrelin tonight with Mr OHara layin dead in the parlor  Page    Gone With The Wind He wont be having any quarreling thought Scarlett indignantly He talks like Tara was his already And then she thought of Gerald dead in the parlor and suddenly she began to cry cry in bitter gulping sobs Will put his arm around her drew her comfortably close and said nothing As they jolted slowly down the darkening road her head on his shoulder her bonnet askew she had forgotten the Gerald of the last two years the vague old gentleman who stared at doors waiting for a woman who would never enter She was remembering the vital virile old man with his mane of crisp white hair his bellowing cheerfulness his stamping boots his clumsy jokes his generosity She remembered how as a child he had seemed the most wonderful man in the world this blustering father who carried her before him on his saddle when he jumped fences turned her up and paddled her when she was naughty and then cried when she cried and gave her quarters to get her to hush She remembered him coming home from Charleston and Atlanta laden with gifts that were never appropriate remembered too with a faint smile through tears how he came home in the wee hours from Court Day at Jonesboro drunk as seven earls jumping fences his rollicking voice raised in The Wearin o the Green And how abashed he was facing Ellen on the morning after Well he was with Ellen now Why didnt you write me that he was ill Id have come so fast He warnt ill not a minute Here honey take my handkerchief and Ill tell you all about it She blew her nose on his bandanna for she had come from Atlanta without even a handkerchief and settled back into the crook of Wills arm How nice Will was Nothing ever upset him Well it was this way Scarlett You been sendin us money right along and Ashley and me well weve paid taxes and bought the mule and seeds and whatall and a few hogs and chickens Miss Mellys done mighty well with the hens yes sir she has Shes a fine woman Miss Melly is Well anyway after we bought things for Tara there warnt so much left over for folderols but none of us warnt complainin Except Suellen Miss Melanie and Miss Carreen stay at home and wear their old clothes like theyre proud of them but you know Suellen Scarlett She hasnt never got used to doin without It used to stick in her craw that she had to wear old dresses every time I took her into Jonesboro or over to Fayetteville Specially as some of those Carpetbaggers ladiwomen was always flouncin around in fancy trimmins The wives of those damn Yankees that run the Freedmens Bureau do they dress up Well its kind of been a point of honor with the ladies of the County to wear their worstlookin dresses to town just to show how they didnt care and was proud to wear them But not Suellen And she wanted a hone and carriage too She pointed out that you had one Its not a carriage its an old buggy said Scarlett indignantly Well no matter what I might as well tell you Suellen never has got over your marryin Frank Kennedy and I dont know as I blame her You know that was a kind of scurvy trick to play on a sister Scarlett rose from his shoulder furious as a rattler ready to strike Scurvy trick hey Ill thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head Win Benteen Could I help it if he preferred me to her Youre a smart girl Scarlett and I figger yes you could have helped him preferrin you Girls always can But I guess you kind of coaxed him Youre a mighty takin person when you want to be but all the same he was Suellens beau Why shed had a letter from him a week before you went to Atlanta and he was sweet as sugar about her and talked about how theyd get married when he got a little more money ahead I know because she showed me the letter Scarlett was silent because she knew he was telling the truth and she could think of nothing to say She had never expected Will of all people to sit in judgment on her Moreover the lie she had told Frank had never weighed heavily upon her conscience If a girl couldnt keep a beau she deserved to lose him Now Will dont be mean she said If Suellen had married him do you think shed ever have spent a penny on Tara or any of us I said you could be right takin when you wanted to said Will turning to her with a quiet grin No I dont think wed ever seen a penny of old Franks money But still theres no gettin round it it was a scurvy trick and if you want to justify the end by the means its none of my business and who am I to complain But just the same Suellen has been like a hornet ever since I dont think she cared much about old Frank but it kind of teched her vanity and shes been sayin as how you had good clothes and a carriage and lived in Atlanta while she was buried here at Tara She does love to go callin and to parties you know and wear pretty clothes I aint blamin her Women are like that Well about a month ago I took her into Jonesboro and left her to go callin while I tended to business and when I took her home she was still as a mouse but I could see she was so excited she was ready to bust I thought shed found out somebody was goin to have athat shed heard some gossip that was interestin and I didnt pay her much mind She went around home for about a week all swelled up and excited and didnt have much to say She went over to see Miss Cathleen CalvertScarlett youd cry your eyes out at Miss Cathleen Pore girl shed better be dead than married to that pusillanimous Yankee Hilton You knew hed mortaged the place and lost it and theyre goin to have to leave No I didnt know and I dont want to know I want to know about Pa Well Im gettin to that said Will patiently When she come back from over there she said wed all misjudged Hilton She called him Mr Hilton and she said he was a smart man but we just laughed at her Then she took to takin your pa out to walk in the afternoons and lots of times when I was comin home from the field Id see her sittin with him on the wall round the buryin ground talkin at him hard and wavin her hands And the old gentleman would just look at her sort of puzzledlike and shake his head You know how hes been Scarlett He just got kind of vaguer and vaguer like he didnt hardly know where he was or who we were One time I seen her point to your mas grave and the old gentleman begun to cry And when she come in the house all happy and excited lookin I gave her a talkin to right sharp too and I said Miss Suellen why in hell are you devilin your poor pa and bringin up your ma to him Most of the time he dont realize shes dead and here you are rubbin it in And she just kind of tossed her head and laughed and said Mind your business Some day youll be glad of what Im doin Miss Melanie told me last night that Suellen had told her about her schemes but Miss Melly said she didnt have no notion Suellen was serious She said she didnt tell none of us because she was so upset at the very idea What idea Are you ever going to get to the point Were halfway home now I want to know about Pa  Page    Gone With The Wind Im trying to tell you said Will and were so near home I guess Id better stop right here till Ive finished He drew rein and the horse stopped and snorted They had halted by the wild overgrown mockorange hedge that marked the Macintosh property Glancing under the dark trees Scarlett could just discern the tall ghostly chimneys still rearing above the silent ruin She wished that Will had chosen any other place to stop Well the long and the short of her idea was to make the Yankees pay for the cotton they burned and the stock they drove off and the fences and the barns they tore down The Yankees Havent you heard about it The Yankee governments been payin claims on all destroyed property of Union sympathizers in the South Of course Ive heard about that said Scarlett But whats that got to do with us A heap in Suellens opinion That day I took her to Jonesboro she run into Mrs Macintosh and when they were gossipin along Suellen couldnt help noticin what finelookin clothes Mrs Macintosh had on and she couldnt help askin about them Then Mrs Macintosh gave herself a lot of airs and said as how her husband had put in a claim with the Federal government for destroyin the property of a loyal Union sympathizer who had never given aid and comfort to the Confederacy in any shape or form They never gave aid and comfort to anybody snapped Scarlett ScotchIrish Well maybe thats true I dont know them Anyway the government gave them wellI forget how many thousand dollars A right smart sum it was though That started Suellen She thought about it all week and didnt say nothin to us because she knew wed just laugh But she just had to talk to somebody so she went over to Miss Cathleens and that damned white trash Hilton gave her a passel of new ideas He pointed out that your pa warnt even born in this country that he hadnt fought in the war and hadnt had no sons to fight and hadnt never held no office under the Confederacy He said they could strain a point about Mr OHara bein a loyal Union sympathizer He filled her up with such truck and she come home and begun workin on Mr OHara Scarlett I bet my life your pa didnt even know half the time what she was talkin about That was what she was countin on that he would take the Iron Clad oath and not even know it Pa take the Iron Clad oath cried Scarlett Well hed gotten right feeble in his mind these last months and I guess she was countin on that Mind you none of us sospicioned nothin about it We knew she was cookin up somethin but we didnt know she was usin your dead ma to reproach him for his daughters bein in rags when he could get a hundred and fifty thousand dollars out of the Yankees One hundred and fifty thousand dollars murmured Scarlett her horror at the oath fading What a lot of money that was And to be had for the mere signing of an oath of allegiance to the United States government an oath stating that the signer had always supported the government and never given aid and comfort to its enemies One hundred and fifty thousand dollars That much money for that small a lie Well she couldnt blame Suellen Good heavens Was that what Alex meant by wanting to rawhide her What the County meant by intending to cut her Fools every one of them What couldnt she do with that much money What couldnt any of the folks in the County do with it And what did so small a lie matter After all anything you could get out of the Yankees was fair money no matter how you got it Yesterday about noon when Ashley and me were splittin rails Suellen got this wagon and got your pa in it and off they went to town without a word to anybody Miss Melly had a notion what it was all about but she was prayin somethin would change Suellen so she didnt say nothin to the rest of us She just didnt see how Suellen could do such a thing Today I heard all about what happened That pusillanimous fellow Hilton had some influence with the other Scalawags and Republicans in town and Suellen had agreed to give them some of the moneyI dont know how muchif theyd kind of wink their eye about Mr OHara bein a loyal Union man and play on how he was an Irishman and didnt fight in the army and so on and sign recommendations All your pa had to do was take the oath and sign the paper and off it would go to Washington They rattled off the oath real fast and he didnt say nothin and it went right well till she got him up to the signin of it And then the old gentleman kind of come to himself for a minute and shook his head I dont think he knew what it was all about but he didnt like it and Suellen always did rub him the wrong way Well that just about gave her the nervous fits after all the trouble shed gone to She took him out of the office and rode him up and down the road and talked to him about your ma cryin out of her grave at him for lettin her children suffer when he could provide for them They tell me your pa sat there in the wagon and cried like a baby like he always does when he hears her name Everybody in town saw them and Alex Fontaine went over to see what was the matter but Suellen gave him the rough side of her tongue and told him to mind his own business so he went off mad I dont know where she got the notion but some time in the afternoon she got a bottle of brandy and took Mr OHara back to the office and begun pourin it for him Scarlett we havent had no spirits round Tara for a year just a little blackberry wine and scuppernong wine Dilcey makes and Mr OHara warnt used to it He got real drunk and after Suellen had argued and nagged a couple of hours he gave in and said Yes hed sign anything she wanted They got the oath out again and just as he was about to put pen to paper Suellen made her mistake She said Well now I guess the Slatterys and the Macintoshes wont be givin themselves airs over us You see Scarlett the Slatterys had put in a claim for a big amount for that little shack of theirs that the Yankees burned and Emmies husband had got it through Washington for them They tell me that when Suellen said those names your pa kind of straightened up and squared his shoulders and looked at her sharplike He warnt vague no more and he said Have the Slatterys and the Macintoshes signed somethin like this and Suellen got nervous and said Yes and No and stuttered and he shouted right loud Tell me did that Goddamned Orangeman and that Goddamned poor white sign somethin like this And that feller Hilton spoke up smoothlike and said Yes sir they did and they got a pile of money like youll get And then the old gentleman let out a roar like a bull Alex Fontaine said he heard him from down the street at the saloon And he said with a brogue you could cut with a butterknife And were ye afther thinkin an OHara of Tara would be follyin the dirthy thracks of a Goddamned Orangeman and a Goddamned poor white And he tore the paper in two and threw it in Suellens face and he bellowed Yere no daughter of mine and he was out of the office before you could say Jack Robinson  Page    Gone With The Wind Alex said he saw him come out on the street chargin like a bull He said the old gentleman looked like his old self for the first time since your ma died Said he was reelin drunk and cussin at the top of his lungs Alex said he never heard such fine cussin Alexs horse was standin there and your pa climbed on it without a byyourleave and off he went in a cloud of dust so thick it choked you cussin every breath he drew Well about sundown Ashley and me were sittin on the front step lookin down the road and mighty worried Miss Melly was upstairs cryin on her bed and wouldnt tell us nothin Terrectly we heard a poundin down the road and somebody yellin like they was fox huntin and Ashley said Thats queer That sounds like Mr OHara when he used to ride over to see us before the war And then we seen him way down at the end of the pasture He must have jumped the fence right over there And he come ridin hellforleather up the hill singin at the top of his voice like he didnt have a care in the world I didnt know your pa had such a voice He was singin Peg in a Lowbacked Car and beatin the horse with his hat and the horse was goin like mad He didnt draw rein when he come near the top and we seen he was goin to jump the pasture fence and we hopped up scared to death and then he yelled Look Ellen Watch me take this one But the horse stopped right on his haunches at the fence and wouldnt take the jump and your pa went right over his head He didnt suffer none He was dead time we got to him I guess it broke his neck Will waited a minute for her to speak and when she did not he picked up the reins Giddap Sherman he said and the horse started on toward home CHAPTER XL SCARLETT SLEPT little that night When the dawn had come and the sun was creeping over the black pines on the hills to the east she rose from her tumbled bed and seating herself on a stool by the window laid her tired head on her arm and looked out over the barn yard and orchard of Tara toward the cotton fields Everything was fresh and dewy and silent and green and the sight of the cotton fields brought a measure of balm and comfort to her sore heart Tara at sunrise looked loved well tended and at peace for all that its master lay dead The squatty log chicken house was clay daubed against rats weasels and clean with whitewash and so was the log stable The garden with its rows of corn brightyellow squash butter beans and turnips was well weeded and neatly fenced with splitoak rails The orchard was cleared of underbrush and only daisies grew beneath the long rows of trees The sun picked out with faint glistening the apples and the furred pink peaches half hidden in the green leaves Beyond lay the curving rows of cotton still and green under the gold of the new sky The ducks and chickens were waddling and strutting off toward the fields for under the bushes in the soft plowed earth were found the choicest worms and slugs Scarletts heart swelled with affection and gratitude to Will who had done all of this Even her loyalty to Ashley could not make her believe he had been responsible for much of this wellbeing for Taras bloom was not the work of a planteraristocrat but of the plodding tireless small farmer who loved his land It was a twohorse farm not the lordly plantation of other days with pastures full of mules and fine horses and cotton and corn stretching as far as eye could see But what there was of it was good and the acres that were lying fallow could be reclaimed when times grew better and they would be the more fertile for their rest Will had done more than merely farm a few acres He had kept sternly at bay those two enemies of Georgia planters the seedling pine and the blackberry brambles They had not stealthily taken garden and pasture and cotton field and lawn and reared themselves insolently by the porches of Tara as they were doing on numberless plantations throughout the state Scarletts heart failed a beat when she thought how close Tara had come to going back to wilderness Between herself and Will they had done a good job They had held off the Yankees the Carpetbaggers and the encroachments of Nature And best of all Will had told her that after the cotton came in in the fall she need send no more moneyunless some other Carpetbagger coveted Tara and skyrocketed the taxes Scarlett knew Will would have a hard pull without her help but she admired and respected his independence As long as he was in the position of hired help he would take her money but now that he was to become her brotherinlaw and the man of the house he intended to stand on his own efforts Yes Will was something the Lord had provided Pork had dug the grave the night before close by Ellens grave and he stood spade in hand behind the moist red clay he was soon to shovel back in place Scarlett stood behind him in the patchy shade of a gnarled lowlimbed cedar the hot sun of the June morning dappling her and tried to keep her eyes away from the red trench in front of her Jim Tarleton little Hugh Munroe Alex Fontaine and old man McRaes youngest grandson came slowly and awkwardly down the path from the house bearing Geralds coffin on two lengths of split oak Behind them at a respectful distance followed a large straggling crowd of neighbors and friends shabbily dressed silent As they came down the sunny path through the garden Pork bowed his head upon the top of the spade handle and cried and Scarlett saw with incurious surprise that the kinks on his head so jettily black when she went to Atlanta a few months before were now grizzled She thanked God tiredly that she had cried all her tears the night before so now she could stand erect and dry eyed The sound of Suellens tears put back of her shoulder irritated her unbearably and she had to clench her fists to keep from turning and slapping the swollen face Sue had been the cause of her fathers death whether she intended it or not and she should have the decency to control herself in front of the hostile neighbors Not a single person had spoken to her that morning or given her one look of sympathy They had kissed Scarlett quietly shaken her hand murmured kind words to Carreen and even to Pork but had looked through Suellen as if she were not there To them she had done worse than murder her father She had tried to betray him into disloyalty to the South And to that grim and closeknit community it was as if she had tried to betray the honor of them all She had broken the solid front the County presented to the world By her attempt to get money from the Yankee government she had aligned herself with Carpetbaggers and Scalawags more hated enemies than the Yankee soldiers had ever been She a member of an old and staunchly Confederate family a planters family had gone over to the enemy and by so doing had brought shame on every family in the County  Page    Gone With The Wind The mourners were seething with indignation and downcast with sorrow especially three of themold man McRae who had been Geralds crony since he came to the upcountry from Savannah so many years before Grandma Fontaine who loved him because he was Ellens husband and Mrs Tarleton who had been closer to him than to any of her neighbors because as she often said he was the only man in the County who knew a stallion from a gelding The sight of the stormy faces of these three in the dim parlor where Gerald lay before the funeral had caused Ashley and Will some uneasiness and they had retired to Ellens office for a consultation Some of them are goin to say somethin about Suellen said Will abruptly biting his straw in half They think they got just cause to say somethin Maybe they have It aint for me to say But Ashley whether theyre right or not well have to resent it bein the men of the family and then therell be trouble Cant nobody do nothin with old man McRae because hes deaf as a post and cant hear folks tryin to shut him up And you know there aint nobody in Gods world ever stopped Grandma Fontaine from speakin her mind And as for Mrs Tarletondid you see her roll them russet eyes of hers every time she looked at Sue Shes got her ears laid back and cant hardly wait If they say somethin we got to take it up and we got enough trouble at Tara now without bein at outs with our neighbors Ashley sighed worriedly He knew the tempers of his neighbors better than Will did and he remembered that fully half of the quarrels and some of the shootings of the days before the war had risen from the County custom of saying a few words over the coffins of departed neighbors Generally the words were eulogistic in the extreme but occasionally they were not Sometimes words meant in the utmost respect were misconstrued by overstrung relatives of the dead and scarcely were the last shovels of earth mounded above the coffin before trouble began In the absence of a priest Ashley was to conduct the services with the aid of Carreens Book of Devotions the assistance of the Methodist and Baptist preachers of Jonesboro and Fayetteville having been tactfully refused Carreen more devoutly Catholic than her sisters had been very upset that Scarlett had neglected to bring a priest from Atlanta with her and had only been a little eased by the reminder that when the priest came down to marry Will and Suellen he could read the services over Gerald It was she who objected to the neighboring Protestant preachers and gave the matter into Ashleys hands marking passages in her book for him to read Ashley leaning against the old secretary knew that the responsibility for preventing trouble lay with him and knowing the hairtrigger tempers of the County was at a loss as to how to proceed Theres no help for it Will he said rumpling his bright hair I cant knock Grandma Fontaine down or old man McRae either and I cant hold my hand over Mrs Tarletons mouth And the mildest thing theyll say is that Suellen is a murderess and a traitor and but for her Mr OHara would still be alive Damn this custom of speaking over the dead Its barbarous Look Ash said Will slowly I aint aimin to have nobody say nothin against Suellen no matter what they think You leave it to me When youve finished with the readin and the prayin and you say If anyone would like to say a few words you look right at me so I can speak first But Scarlett watching the pallbearers difficulty in getting the coffin through the narrow entrance into the burying ground had no thought of trouble to come after the funeral She was thinking with a leaden heart that in burying Gerald she was burying one of the last links that joined her to the old days of happiness and irresponsibility Finally the pallbearers set the coffin down near the grave and stood clenching and unclenching their aching fingers Ashley Melanie and Will filed into the enclosure and stood behind the OHara girls All the closer neighbors who could crowd in were behind them and the others stood outside the brick wall Scarlett really seeing them for the first time was surprised and touched by the size of the crowd With transportation so limited it was kind of so many to come There were fifty or sixty people there some of them from so far away she wondered how they had heard in time to come There were whole families from Jonesboro and Fayetteville and Lovejoy and with them a few negro servants Many small farmers from far across the river were present and Crackers from the backwoods and a scattering of swamp folk The swamp men were lean bearded giants in homespun coonskin caps on their heads their rifles easy in the crooks of their arms their wads of tobacco stilled in their cheeks Their women were with them their bare feet sunk in the soft red earth their lower lips full of snuff Their faces beneath their sunbonnets were sallow and malariallooking but shining clean and their freshly ironed calicoes glistened with starch The near neighbors were there in full force Grandma Fontaine withered wrinkled and yellow as an old molted bird was leaning on her cane and behind her were Sally Munroe Fontaine and Young Miss Fontaine They were trying vainly by whispered pleas and jerks at her skirt to make the old lady sit down on the brick wall Grandmas husband the Old Doctor was not there He had died two months before and much of the bright malicious joy of life had gone from her old eyes Cathleen Calvert Hilton stood alone as befitted one whose husband had helped bring about the present tragedy her faded sunbonnet hiding her bowed face Scarlett saw with amazement that her percale dress had grease spots on it and her hands were freckled and unclean There were even black crescents under her fingernails There was nothing of quality folks about Cathleen now She looked Cracker even worse She looked poor white shiftless slovenly trifling Shell be dipping snuff soon if she isnt doing it already thought Scarlett in horror Good Lord What a comedown She shuddered turning her eyes from Cathleen as she realized how narrow was the chasm between quality folk and poor whites There but for a lot of gumption am I she thought and pride surged through her as she realized that she and Cathleen had started with the same equipment after the surrenderempty hands and what they had in their heads I havent done so bad she thought lifting her chin and smiling But she stopped in midsmile as she saw the scandalized eyes of Mrs Tarleton upon her Her eyes were redrimmed from tears and after giving Scarlett a reproving look she turned her gaze back to Suellen a fierce angry gaze that boded ill for her Behind her and her husband were the four Tarleton girls their red locks indecorous notes in the solemn occasion their russet eyes still looking like the eyes of vital young animals spirited and dangerous Feet were stilled hats were removed hands folded and skirts rustled into quietness as Ashley stepped forward with Carreens worn Book of Devotions in his hand He stood for a moment looking down the sun glittering on his golden head A deep silence fell on the crowd so deep that the harsh whisper of the wind in the magnolia leaves came clear to their ears and the faroff  Page    Gone With The Wind repetitious note of a mockingbird sounded unendurably loud and sad Ashley began to read the prayers and all heads bowed as his resonant beautifully modulated voice rolled out the brief and dignified words Oh thought Scarlett her throat constricting How beautiful his voice is If anyone has to do this for Pa Im glad its Ashley Id rather have him than a priest Id rather have Pa buried by one of his own folks than a stranger When Ashley came to the part of the prayers concerning the souls in Purgatory which Carreen had marked for him to read he abruptly closed the book Only Carreen noticed the omission and looked up puzzled as he began the Lords Prayer Ashley knew that half the people present had never heard of Purgatory and those who had would take it as a personal affront if he insinuated even in prayer that so fine a man as Mr OHara had not gone straight to Heaven So in deference to public opinion he skipped all mention of Purgatory The gathering joined heartily in the Lords Prayer but their voices trailed off into embarrassed silence when he began the Hail Mary They had never heard that prayer and they looked furtively at each other as the OHara girls Melanie and the Tara servants gave the response Pray for us now and at the hour of our death Amen Then Ashley raised his head and stood for a moment uncertain The eyes of the neighbors were expectantly upon him as they settled themselves in easier positions for a long harangue They were waiting for him to go on with the service for it did not occur to any of them that he was at the end of the Catholic prayers County funerals were always long The Baptist and Methodist ministers who performed them had no set prayers but extemporized as the circumstances demanded and seldom stopped before all mourners were in tears and the bereaved feminine relatives screaming with grief The neighbors would have been shocked aggrieved and indignant had these brief prayers been all the service over the body of their loved friend and no one knew this better than Ashley The matter would be discussed at dinner tables for weeks and the opinion of the County would be that the OHara girls had not shown proper respect for their father So he threw a quick apologetic glance at Carreen and bowing his head again began reciting from memory the Episcopal burial service which he had often read over slaves buried at Twelve Oaks I am the Resurrection and the Life  and whosoever  believeth in Me shall never die It did not come back to him readily and he spoke slowly occasionally falling silent for a space as he waited for phrases to rise from his memory But this measured delivery made his words more impressive and mourners who had been dryeyed before began now to reach for handkerchiefs Sturdy Baptists and Methodists all they thought it the Catholic ceremony and immediately rearranged their first opinion that the Catholic services were cold and Popish Scarlett and Suellen were equally ignorant and thought the words comforting and beautiful Only Melanie and Carreen realized that a devoutly Catholic Irishman was being laid to rest by the Church of Englands service And Carreen was too stunned by grief and her hurt at Ashleys treachery to interfere When he had finished Ashley opened wide his sad gray eyes and looked about the crowd After a pause his eyes caught those of Will and he said Is there anyone present who would like to say a word Mrs Tarleton twitched nervously but before she could act Will stumped forward and standing at the head of the coffin began to speak Friends he began in his flat voice maybe you think Im gettin above myself speakin firstme who never knew Mr OHara till bout a year ago when you all have known him twenty years or more But this here is my excuse If hed lived a month or so longer Id have had the right to call him Pa A startled ripple went over the crowd They were too well bred to whisper but they shifted on their feet and stared at Carreens bowed head Everyone knew his dumb devotion to her Seeing the direction in which all eyes were cast Will went on as if he had taken no note So bein as how Im to marry Miss Suellen as soon as the priest comes down from Atlanta I thought maybe that gives me the right to speak first The last part of his speech was lost in a faint sibilant buzz that went through the gathering an angry beelike buzz There were indignation and disappointment in the sound Everyone liked Will everyone respected him for what he had done for Tara Everyone knew his affections lay with Carreen so the news that he was to marry the neighborhood pariah instead sat ill upon them Good old Will marrying that nasty sneaking little Suellen OHara For a moment the air was tense Mrs Tarletons eyes began to snap and her lips to shape soundless words In the silence old man McRaes high voice could be heard imploring his grandson to tell him what had been said Will faced them all still mild of face but there was something in his pale blue eyes which dared them to say one word about his future wife For a moment the balance hung between the honest affection everyone had for Will and their contempt for Suellen And Will won He continued as if his pause had been a natural one I never knew Mr OHara in his prime like you all done All I knew personally was a fine old gentleman who was a mite addled But Ive heard tell from you all bout what he used to be like And I want to say this He was a fightin Irishman and a Southern gentleman and as loyal a Confederate as ever lived You cant get no better combination than that And we aint likely to see many more like him because the times that bred men like him are as dead as he is He was born in a furrin country but the man were buryin here today was more of a Georgian than any of us mournin him He lived our life he loved our land and when you come right down to it he died for our Cause same as the soldiers did He was one of us and he had our good points and our bad points and he had our strength and he had our failins He had our good points in that couldnt nothin stop him when his mind was made up and he warnt scared of nothin that walked in shoe leather There warnt nothin that come to him from the outside that could lick him He warnt scared of the English government when they wanted to hang him He just lit out and left home And when he come to this country and was pore that didnt scare him a mite neither He went to work and he made his money And he warnt scared to tackle this section when it was part wild and the Injuns had just been run out of it He made a big plantation out of a wilderness And when the war come on and his money begun to go he warnt scared to be pore again And when the Yankees come through Tara and might of burnt him out or killed him he warnt fazed a bit and he warnt licked neither He just planted his front feet and stood his ground Thats why I say he had our good points There aint nothin from the outside can lick any of us  Page    Gone With The Wind But he had our failins too cause he could be licked from the inside I mean to say that what the whole world couldnt do his own heart could When Mrs OHara died his heart died too and he was licked And what we seen walking round here warnt him Will paused and his eyes went quietly around the circle of faces The crowd stood in the hot sun as if enchanted to the ground and whatever wrath they had felt for Suellen was forgotten Wills eyes rested for a moment on Scarlett and they crinkled slightly at the corners as if he were inwardly smiling comfort to her Scarlett who had been fighting back rising tears did feel comforted Will was talking common sense instead of a lot of tootle about reunions in another and better world and submitting her will to Gods And Scarlett had always found strength and comfort in common sense And I dont want none of you to think the less of him for breakin like he done All you all and me too are like him We got the same weakness and failin There aint nothin that walks can lick us any more than it could lick him not Yankees nor Carpetbaggers nor hard times nor high taxes nor even downright starvation But that weakness thats in our hearts can lick us in the time it takes to bat your eye It aint always losin someone you love that does it like it done Mr OHara Everybodys mainspring is different And I want to say thisfolks whose mainsprings are busted are better dead There aint no place for them in the world these days and theyre happier bein dead  Thats why Im sayin you all aint got no cause to grieve for Mr OHara now The time to grieve was back when Sherman come through and he lost Mrs OHara Now that his bodys gone to join his heart I dont see that we got reason to mourn unless were pretty damned selfish and Im sayin it who loved him like he was my own pa  There wont be no more words said if you folks dont mind The family is too cut up to listen and it wouldnt be no kindness to them Will stopped and turning to Mrs Tarleton he said in a lower voice I wonder couldnt you take Scarlett in the house Mam It aint right for her to be standin in the sun so long And Grandma Fontaine dont look any too peart neither meanin no disrespect Startled at the abrupt switching from the eulogy to herself Scarlett went red with embarrassment as all eyes turned toward her Why should Will advertise her already obvious pregnancy She gave him a shamed indignant look but Wills placid gaze bore her down Please his look said I know what Im doin Already he was the man of the house and not wishing to make a scene Scarlett turned helplessly to Mrs Tarleton That lady suddenly diverted as Will had intended from thoughts of Suellen to the always fascinating matter of breeding be it animal or human took Scarletts arm Come in the house honey Her face took on a look of kind absorbed interest and Scarlett suffered herself to be led through the crowd that gave way and made a narrow path for her There was a sympathetic murmuring as she passed and several hands went out to pat her comfortingly When she came abreast Grandma Fontaine the old lady put out a skinny claw and said Give me your arm child and added with a fierce glance at Sally and Young Miss No dont you come I dont want you They passed slowly through the crowd which closed behind them and went up the shady path toward the house Mrs Tarletons eager helping hand so strong under Scarletts elbow that she was almost lifted from the ground at each step Now why did Will do that cried Scarlett heatedly when they were out of earshot He practically said Look at her Shes going to have a baby  Well sakes alive you are arent you said Mrs Tarleton Will did right It was foolish of you to stand in the hot sun when you might have fainted and had a miscarriage Will wasnt bothered about her miscarrying said Grandma a little breathless as she labored across the front yard toward the steps There was a grim knowing smile on her face Wills smart He didnt want either you or me Beetrice at the graveside He was scared of what wed say and he knew this was the only way to get rid of us  And it was more than that He didnt want Scarlett to hear the clods dropping on the coffin And hes right Just remember Scarlett as long as you dont hear that sound folks arent actually dead to you But once you hear it  Well its the most dreadfully final sound in the world  Help me up the steps child and give me a hand Beetrice Scarlett dont any more need your arm than she needs crutches and Im not so peart as Will observed  Will knew you were your fathers pet and he didnt want to make it worse for you than it already was He figured it wouldnt be so bad for your sisters Suellen has her shame to sustain her and Carreen her God But youve got nothing to sustain you have you child No answered Scarlett helping the old lady up the Steps faintly surprised at the truth that sounded in the reedy old voice Ive never had anything to sustain meexcept Mother But when you lost her you found you could stand alone didnt you Well some folks cant Your pa was one Wills right Dont you grieve He couldnt get along without Ellen and hes happier where he is Just like Ill be happier when I join the Old Doctor She spoke without any desire for sympathy and the two gave her none She spoke as briskly and naturally as if her husband were alive and in Jonesboro and a short buggy ride would bring them together Grandma was too old and had seen too much to fear death Butyou can stand alone too said Scarlett Yes but its powerful uncomfortable at times Look here Grandma interrupted Mrs Tarleton you ought not to talk to Scarlett like that Shes upset enough already What with her trip down here and that tight dress and her grief and the heat shes got enough to make her miscarry without your adding to it talking grief and sorrow Gods nightgown cried Scarlett in irritation Im not upset And Im not one of those sickly miscarrying fools You never can tell said Mrs Tarleton omnisciently I lost my first when I saw a bull gore one of our darkies andyou remember my red mare Nellie Now there was the healthiestlooking mare you ever saw but she was nervous and high strung and if I didnt watch her shed  Page    Gone With The Wind Beatrice hush said Grandma Scarlett wouldnt miscarry on a bet Lets us sit here in the hall where its cool Theres a nice draft through here Now you go fetch us a glass of buttermilk Beetrice if theres any in the kitchen Or look in the pantry and see if theres any wine I could do with a glass Well sit here till the folks come up to say goodby Scarlett ought to be in bed insisted Mrs Tarleton running her eyes over her with the expert air of one who calculated a pregnancy to the lastminute of its length Get going said Grandma giving her a prod with her cane and Mrs Tarleton went toward the kitchen throwing her hat carelessly on the sideboard and running her hands through her damp red hair Scarlett lay back in her chair and unbuttoned the two top buttons of her tight basque it was cool and dim in the highceilinged hall and the vagrant draft that went from back to front of the house was refreshing after the heat of the sun She looked across the hall into the parlor where Gerald had lain and wrenching her thoughts from him looked up at the portrait of Grandma Robillard hanging above the fireplace The bayonetscarred portrait with its highpiled hair halfexposed breasts and cool insolence had as always a tonic effect upon her I dont know which hit Beetrice Tarleton worse losing her boys or her horses said Grandma Fontaine She never did pay much mind to Jim or her girls you know Shes one of those folks Will was talking about Her mainsprings busted Sometimes I wonder if she wont go the way your pa went She wasnt ever happy unless horses or humans were breeding right in her face and none of her girls are married or got any prospects of catching husbands in this county so shes got nothing to occupy her mind If she wasnt such a lady at heart shed be downright common  Was Will telling the truth about marrying Suellen Yes said Scarlett looking the old lady full in the eye Goodness she could remember the time when she was scared to death of Grandma Fontaine Well shed grown up since then and shed just as soon as not tell her to go to the devil if she meddled in affairs at Tara He could do better said Grandma candidly Indeed said Scarlett haughtily Come off your high horse Miss said the old lady tartly I shant attack your precious sister though I might have if Id stayed at the burying ground What I mean is with the scarcity of men in the neighborhood Will could marry most any of the girls Theres Beatrices four wild cats and the Munroe girls and the McRae Hes going to marry Sue and thats that Shes lucky to get him Tara is lucky to get him You love this place dont you Yes So much that you dont mind your sister marrying out of her class as long as you have a man around to care for Tara Class said Scarlett startled at the idea Class What does class matter now so long as a girl gets a husband who can take care of her Thats a debatable question said Old Miss Some folks would say you were talking common sense Others would say you were letting down bars that ought never be lowered one inch Wills certainly not quality folks and some of your people were Her sharp old eyes went to the portrait of Grandma Robillard Scarlett thought of Will lank unimpressive mild eternally chewing a straw his whole appearance deceptively devoid of energy like that of most Crackers He did not have behind him a long line of ancestors of wealth prominence and blood The first of Wills family to set foot on Georgia soil might even have been one of Oglethorpes debtors or a bond servant Will had not been to college In fact four years in a backwoods school was all the education he had ever had He was honest and he was loyal he was patient and he was hard working but certainly he was not quality Undoubtedly by Robillard standards Suellen was coming down in the world So you approve of Will coming into your family Yes answered Scarlett fiercely ready to pounce upon the old lady at the first words of condemnation You may kiss me said Grandma surprisingly and she smiled in her most approving manner I never liked you much till now Scarlett You were always hard as a hickory nut even as a child and I dont like hard females barring myself But I do like the way you meet things You dont make a fuss about things that cant be helped even if they are disagreeable You take your fences cleanly like a good hunter Scarlett smiled uncertainly and pecked obediently at the withered cheek presented to her It was pleasant to hear approving words again even if she had little idea what they meant Theres plenty of folks hereabouts wholl have something to say about you letting Sue marry a Crackerfor all that everybody likes Will Theyll say in one breath what a fine man he is and how terrible it is for an OHara girl to marry beneath her But dont you let it bother you Ive never bothered about what people said So Ive heard There was a hint of acid in the old voice Well dont bother about what folks say Itll probably be a very successful marriage Of course Wills always going to look like a Cracker and marriage wont improve his grammar any And even if he makes a mint of money hell never lend any shine and sparkle to Tara like your father did Crackers are short on sparkle But Wills a gentleman at heart Hes got the right instincts Nobody but a born gentleman could have put his finger on what is wrong with us as accurately as he just did down there at the burying The whole world cant lick us but we can lick ourselves by longing too hard for things we havent got any moreand by remembering too much Yes Will will do well by Suellen and by Tara Then you approve of me letting him marry her God no The old voice was tired and bitter but vigorous Approve of Crackers marrying into old families Bah Would I approve of breeding scrub stock to thoroughbreds Oh Crackers are good and solid and honest but But you said you thought it would be a successful match cried Scarlett bewildered  Page    Gone With The Wind Oh I think its good for Suellen to marry Willto marry anybody for that matter because she needs a husband bad And where else could she get one And where else could you get as good a manager for Tara But that doesnt mean I like the situation any better than you do But I do like it thought Scarlett trying to grasp the old ladys meaning Im glad Will is going to marry her Why should she think I minded Shes taking it for granted that I do mind just like her She felt puzzled and a little ashamed as always when people attributed to her emotions and motives they possessed and thought she shared Grandma fanned herself with her palmetto leaf and went on briskly I dont approve of the match any more than you do but Im practical and so are you And when it comes to something thats unpleasant but cant be helped I dont see any sense in screaming and kicking about it Thats no way to meet the ups and downs of life I know because my family and the Old Doctors family have had more than our share of ups and downs And if we folks have a motto its this Dont hollersmile and bide your time Weve survived a passel of things that way smiling and biding our time and weve gotten to be experts at surviving We had to be Weve always bet on the wrong horses Run out of France with the Huguenots run out of England with the Cavaliers run out of Scotland with Bonnie Prince Charlie run out of Haiti by the niggers and now licked by the Yankees But we always turn up on top in a few years You know why She cocked her head and Scarlett thought she looked like nothing so much as an old knowing parrot No I dont know Im sure she answered politely But she was heartily bored even as she had been the day when Grandma launched on her memories of the Creek uprising Well this is the reason We bow to the inevitable Were not wheat were buckwheat When a storm comes along it flattens ripe wheat because its dry and cant bend with the wind But ripe buckwheats got sap in it and it bends And when the wind has passed it springs up almost as straight and strong as before We arent a stiffnecked tribe Were mighty limber when a hard winds blowing because we know it pays to be limber When trouble comes we bow to the inevitable without any mouthing and we work and we smile and we bide our time And we play along with lesser folks and we take what we can get from them And when were strong enough we kick the folks whose necks weve climbed over That my child is the secret of the survival And after a pause she added I pass it on to you The old lady cackled as if she were amused by her words despite the venom in them She looked as if she expected some comment from Scarlett but the words had made little sense to her and she could think of nothing to say No sir Old Miss went on our folks get flattened out but they rise up again and thats more than I can say for plenty of people not so far away from here Look at Cathleen Calvert You can see what shes come to Poor white And a heap lower than the man she married Look at the McRae family Flat to the ground helpless dont know what to do dont know how to do anything Wont even try They spend their time whining about the good old days And look atwell look at nearly anybody in this County except my Alex and my Sally and you and Jim Tarleton and his girls and some others The rest have gone under because they didnt have any sap in them because they didnt have the gumption to rise up again There never was anything to those folks but money and darkies and now that the money and darkies are gone those folks will be Cracker in another generation You forgot the Wilkes No I didnt forget them I just thought Id be polite and not mention them seeing that Ashleys a guest under this roof But seeing as how youve brought up their nameslook at them Theres India who from all I hear is a driedup old maid already giving herself all kinds of widowed airs because Stu Tarleton was killed and not making any effort to forget him and try to catch another man Of course shes old but she could catch some widower with a big family if she tried And poor Honey was always a mancrazy fool with no more sense than a guinea hen And as for Ashley look at him Ashley is a very fine man began Scarlett hotly I never said he wasnt but hes as helpless as a turtle on his back If the Wilkes family pulls through these hard times itll be Melly who pulls them through Not Ashley Melly Lord Grandma What are you talking about Ive lived with Melly long enough to know shes sickly and scared and hasnt the gumption to say Boo to a goose Now why on earth should anyone want to say Boo to a goose It always sounded like a waste of time to me She might not say Boo to a goose but shed say Boo to the world or the Yankee government or anything else that threatened her precious Ashley or her boy or her notions of gentility Her way isnt your way Scarlett or my way Its the way your mother would have acted if shed lived Melly puts me in mind of your mother when she was young  And maybe shell pull the Wilkes family through Oh Mellys a wellmeaning little ninny But you are very unjust to Ashley Hes Oh foot Ashley was bred to read books and nothing else That doesnt help a man pull himself out of a tough fix like were all in now From what I hear hes the worst plow hand in the County Now you just compare him with my Alex Before the war Alex was the most worthless dandy in the world and he never had a thought beyond a new cravat and getting drunk and shooting somebody and chasing girls who were no better than they should be But look at him now He learned farming because he had to learn Hed have starved and so would all of us Now he raises the best cotton in the Countyyes Miss Its a heap better than Tara cottonand he knows what to do with hogs and chickens Ha Hes a fine boy for all his bad temper He knows how to bide his time and change with changing ways and when all this Reconstruction misery is over youre going to see my Alex as rich a man as his father and his grandfather were But Ashley Scarlett was smarting at the slight to Ashley It all sounds like tootle to me she said coldly Well it shouldnt said Grandma fastening a sharp eye upon her For its just exactly the course youve been following since you went to Atlanta Oh yes We hear of your didoes even if we are buried down here in the country Youve changed with the changing times too We hear how you suck up to the Yankees and the white trash and the newrich Carpetbaggers to get money out of them Butter doesnt melt in your mouth from all I can hear Well go to it I say And get every cent out of them you  Page    Gone With The Wind can but when youve got enough money kick them in the face because they cant serve you any longer Be sure you do that and do it properly for trash hanging onto your coat tails can ruin you Scarlett looked at her her brow wrinkling with the effort to digest the words They still didnt make much sense and she was still angry at Ashley being called a turtle on his back I think youre wrong about Ashley she said abruptly Scarlett you just arent smart Thats your opinion said Scarlett rudely wishing it were permissible to smack old ladies jaws Oh youre smart enough about dollars and cents Thats a mans way of being smart But you arent smart at all like a woman You arent a speck smart about folks Scarletts eyes began to snap fire and her hands to clench and unclench Ive made you good and mad havent I asked the old lady smiling Well I aimed to do just that Oh you did did you And why pray I had good and plenty reasons Grandma sank back in her chair and Scarlett suddenly realized that she looked very tired and incredibly old The tiny clawlike hands folded over the fan were yellow and waxy as a dead persons The anger went out of Scarletts heart as a thought came to her She leaned over and took one of the hands in hers Youre a mighty sweet old liar she said You didnt mean a word of all this rigmarole Youve just been talking to keep my mind off Pa havent you Dont fiddle with me said Old Miss grumpily Jerking away her hand Partly for that reason partly because what Ive been telling you is the truth and youre just too stupid to realize it But she smiled a little and took the sting from her words Scarletts heart emptied itself of wrath about Ashley It was nice to know Grandma hadnt meant any of it Thank you just the same It was nice of you to talk to meand Im glad to know youre with me about Will and Suellen even ifeven if a lot of other people do disapprove Mrs Tarleton came down the hall carrying two glasses of buttermilk She did all domestic things badly and the glasses were slopping over I had to go clear to the spring house to get it she said Drink it quick because the folks are coming up from the burying ground Scarlett are you really going to let Suellen marry Will Not that he isnt a sight too good for her but you know he is a Cracker and Scarletts eyes met those of Grandma There was a wicked sparkle in the old eyes that found an answer in her own CHAPTER XLI WHEN THE LAST GOODBY had been said and the last sound of wheels and hooves died away Scarlett went into Ellens office and removed a gleaming object from where she had hidden it the night before between the yellowed papers in the pigeonholes of the secretary Hearing Pork sniffling in the dining room as he went about laying the table for dinner she called to him He came to her his black face as forlorn as a lost and masterless hound Pork she said sternly you cry just once more and IllIll cry too Youve got to stop Yasm Ah try but evey time Ah try Ah thinks of Mist Gerald an Well dont think I can stand everybody elses tears but not yours There she broke off gently dont you see I cant stand yours because I know how you loved him Blow your nose

house Lawd Gawd Miss Scarlett Ah ain never Well you did so dont lie to me about it at this late date You remember I said I was going to give you a watch for being so faithful Yasm Ah members Ah

he was sick and feeble Did he bathe him and dress him and shave him Did he stick by him when the Yankees came Did he steal for him Dont be a fool Pork If ever anyone deserved a watch you do and I know Pa would approve Here She picked up the black hand and laid the watch in the palm Pork gazed at it reverently and slowly delight spread over his face Fer me truly Miss Scarlett Yes indeed Wellmthankee

Ef you wuz jes half as nice ter wite folks as you is ter niggers Ah spec de worl would treat you better It treats me well enough she said Now go find Mr Ashley and tell him I want to see him here right away Ashley sat on Ellens little writing chair his long body dwarfing the frail bit of furniture while Scarlett offered him a halfinterest in the mill Not once did his eyes meet hers and he spoke no word of interruption He sat looking down at his hands turning them over slowly inspecting first palms and then backs as though he had never seen them before Despite hard work they were still slender and sensitive looking and remarkably well tended for a farmers hands His bowed head and silence disturbed her a little and she redoubled her efforts to make the mill sound attractive She brought to bear too all the charm of smile and glance she possessed but they were wasted for he did not raise his eyes If he would only look at her She made no mention of the information Will had given her of Ashleys determination to go North and spoke with the outward assumption that no obstacle stood in the way of his agreement with her plan Still he did not speak and finally her words trailed into silence There was a determined squareness about his slender shoulders that alarmed her Surely he wouldnt refuse What earthly reason could he have for refusing Ashley she began again and paused She had not intended using her pregnancy as an argument had shrunk from the thought of Ashley even seeing her so bloated and ugly but as her other persuasions seemed to have made no impression she decided to use it and her helplessness as a last card You must come to Atlanta I do need your help so badly now because I cant look after the mills It may be months before I can becauseyou seewell because  Please he said roughly Good God Scarlett He rose and went abruptly to the window and stood with his back to her watching the solemn single file of ducks parade across the barnyard Is thatis that why you wont look at me she questioned forlornly I know I look He swung around in a flash and his gray eyes met hers with an intensity that made her hands go to her throat Damn your looks he said with a swift violence You know you always look beautiful to me Happiness flooded her until her eyes were liquid with tears How sweet of you to say that For I was so ashamed to let you see me You ashamed Why should you be ashamed Im the one to feel shame and I do If it hadnt been for my stupidity you wouldnt be in this fix Youd never have married Frank I should never have let you leave Tara last winter Oh fool that I was I should have known youknown you were desperate so desperate that youdI should haveI should have His face went haggard Scarletts heart beat wildly He was regretting that he had not run away with her The least I could have done was go out and commit highway robbery or murder to get the tax money for you when you had taken us in as beggars Oh I messed it up all the way around Her heart contracted with disappointment and some of the happiness went from her for these were not the words she hoped to hear I would have gone anyway she said tiredly I couldnt have let you do anything like that And anyway its done now Yes its done now he said with slow bitterness You wouldnt have let me do anything dishonorable but you would sell yourself to a man you didnt loveand bear his child so that my family and I wouldnt starve It was kind of you to shelter my helplessness The edge in his voice spoke of a raw unhealed wound that ached within him and his words brought shame to her eyes He was swift to see it and his face changed to gentleness You didnt think I was blaming you Dear God Scarlett No You are the bravest woman Ive ever known Its myself Im blaming He turned and looked out of the window again and the shoulders presented to her gaze did not look quite so square Scarlett waited a long moment in silence hoping that Ashley would return to the mood in which he spoke of her beauty hoping he would say more words that she could treasure It had been so long since she had seen him and she had lived on memories until they were worn thin She knew he still loved her That fact was evident in every line of him in every bitter selfcondemnatory word in his resentment at her bearing Franks child She so longed to hear him say it in words longed to speak words herself that would provoke a confession but she dared not She remembered her promise given last winter in the orchard that she would never again throw herself at his head Sadly she knew that promise must be kept if Ashley were to remain near her One cry from her of love and longing one look that pleaded for his arms and the matter would be settled forever Ashley would surely go to New York And he must not go away Oh Ashley dont blame yourself How could it be your fault You will come to Atlanta and help me wont you No But Ashley her voice was beginning to break with anguish and disappointment But Id counted on you I do need you so Frank cant help me Hes so busy with the store and if you dont come I dont know where I can get a man Everybody in Atlanta who is smart is busy with his own affairs and the others are so incompetent and  Page    Gone With The Wind Its no use Scarlett You mean youd rather go to New York and live among Yankees than come to Atlanta Who told you that He turned and faced her faint annoyance wrinkling his forehead Will Yes Ive decided to go North An old friend who made the Grand Tour with me before the war has offered me a position in his fathers bank Its better so Scarlett Id be no good to you I know nothing of the lumber business But you know less about banking and its much harder And I know Id make far more allowances for your inexperience than Yankees would He winced and she knew she had said the wrong thing He turned and looked out of the window again I dont want allowances made for me I want to stand on my own feet for what Im worth What have I done with my life up till now Its time I made something of myselfor went down through my own fault Ive been your pensioner too long already But Im offering you a halfinterest in the mill Ashley You would be standing on your own feet becauseyou see it would be your own business It would amount to the same thing Id not be buying the halfinterest Id be taking it as a gift And Ive taken too many gifts from you already Scarlettfood and shelter and even clothes for myself and Melanie and the baby And Ive given you nothing in return Oh but you have Will couldnt have I can split kindling very nicely now Oh Ashley she cried despairingly tears in her eyes at the jeering note in his voice What has happened to you since Ive been gone You sound so hard and bitter You didnt used to be this way Whats happened A very remarkable thing Scarlett Ive been thinking I dont believe I really thought from the time of the surrender until you went away from here I was in a state of suspended animation and it was enough that I had something to eat and a bed to lie on But when you went to Atlanta shouldering a mans burden I saw myself as much less than a manmuch less indeed than a woman Such thoughts arent pleasant to live with and I do not intend to live with them any longer Other men came out of the war with less than I had and look at them now So Im going to New York ButI dont understand If its work you want why wont Atlanta do as well as New York And my mill No Scarlett This is my last chance Ill go North If I go to Atlanta and work for you Im lost forever The word lostlostlost dinged frighteningly in her heart like a death bell sounding Her eyes went quickly to his but they were wide and crystal gray and they were looking through her and beyond her at some fate she could not see could not understand Lost Do you meanhave you done something the Atlanta Yankees can get you for I mean about helping Tony get away oror Oh Ashley you arent in the Ku Klux are you His remote eyes came back to her swiftly and he smiled a brief smile that never reached his eyes I had forgotten you were so literal No its not the Yankees Im afraid of I mean if I go to Atlanta and take help from you again I bury forever any hope of ever standing alone Oh she sighed in quick relief if its only that Yes and he smiled again the smile more wintry than before Only that Only my masculine pride my selfrespect and if you choose to so call it my immortal soul But she swung around on another tack you could gradually buy the mill from me and it would be your own and then Scarlett he interrupted fiercely I tell you no There are other reasons What reasons You know my reasons better than anyone in the world Ohthat Butthatll be all right she assured swiftly I promised you know out in the orchard last winter and Ill keep my promise and Then you are surer of yourself than I am I could not count on myself to keep such a promise I should not have said that but I had to make you understand Scarlett I will not talk of this any more Its finished When Will and Suellen marry I am going to New York His eyes wide and stormy met hers for an instant and then he went swiftly across the room His hand was on the door knob Scarlett stared at him in agony The interview was ended and she had lost Suddenly weak from the strain and sorrow of the last day and the present disappointment her nerves broke abruptly and she screamed Oh Ashley And flinging herself down on the sagging sofa she burst into wild crying She heard his uncertain footsteps leaving the door and his helpless voice saying her name over and over above her head There was a swift pattering of feet racing up the hall from the kitchen and Melanie burst into the room her eyes wide with alarm Scarlett  the baby isnt   Scarlett burrowed her head in the dusty upholstery and screamed again Ashleyhes so mean So doggoned meanso hateful Oh Ashley what have you done to her Melanie threw herself on the floor beside the sofa and gathered Scarlett into her arms What have you said How could you You might bring on the baby There my darling put your head on Melanies shoulder What is wrong Ashleyhes soso bullheaded and hateful Ashley Im surprised at you Upsetting her so much and in her condition and Mr OHara hardly in his grave Dont you fuss at him cried Scarlett illogically raising her head abruptly from Melanies shoulder her coarse black hair tumbling out from its net and her face streaked with tears Hes got a right to do as he pleases Melanie said Ashley his face white let me explain Scarlett was kind enough to offer me a position in Atlanta as manager of one of her mills  Page    Gone With The Wind Manager cried Scarlett indignantly I offered him a halfinterest and he And I told her I had already made arrangements for us to go North and she Oh cried Scarlett beginning to sob again I told him and told him how much I needed himhow I couldnt get anybody to manage the millhow I was going to have this babyand he refused to come And nownow Ill have to sell the mill and I know I cant get anything like a good price for it and Ill lose money and I guess maybe well starve but he wont care Hes so mean She burrowed her head back into Melanies thin shoulder and some of the real anguish went from her as a flicker of hope woke in her She could sense that in Melanies devoted heart she had an ally feel Melanies indignation that anyone even her beloved husband should make Scarlett cry Melanie flew at Ashley like a small determined dove and pecked him for the first time in her life Ashley how could you refuse her And after all shes done for us How ungrateful you make us appear And she so helpless now with the bab How unchivalrous of you She helped us when we needed help and now you deny her when she needs you Scarlett peeped slyly at Ashley and saw surprise and uncertainty plain in his face as he looked into Melanies dark indignant eyes Scarlett was surprised too at the vigor of Melanies attack for she knew Melanie considered her husband beyond wifely reproaches and thought his decisions second only to Gods Melanie  he began and then threw out his hands helplessly Ashley how can you hesitate Think what shes done for usfor me Id have died in Atlanta when Beau came if it hadnt been for her And sheyes she killed a Yankee defending us Did you know that She killed a man for us And she worked and slaved before you and Will came home just to keep food in our mouths And when I think of her plowing and picking cotton I could just Oh my darling And she swooped her head and kissed Scarletts tumbled hair in fierce loyalty And now the first time she asks us to do something for her You dont need to tell me what she has done for us And Ashley just think Besides helping her just think what itll mean for us to live in Atlanta among our own people and not have to live with Yankees Therell be Auntie and Uncle Henry and all our friends and Beau can have lots of playmates and go to school If we went North we couldnt let him go to school and associate with Yankee children and have pickaninnies in his class Wed have to have a governess and I dont see how wed afford Melanie said Ashley and his voice was deadly quiet do you really want to go to Atlanta so badly You never said so when we talked about going to New York You never intimated Oh but when we talked about going to New York I thought there was nothing for you in Atlanta and besides it wasnt my place to say anything Its a wifes duty to go where her husband goes But now that Scarlett needs us so and has a position that only you can fill we can go home Home Her voice was rapturous as she squeezed Scarlett And Ill see Five Points again and Peachtree road and and Oh how Ive missed them all And maybe we could have a little home of our own I wouldnt care how little and tacky it was buta home of our own Her eyes blazed with enthusiasm and happiness and the two stared at her Ashley with a queer stunned look Scarlett with surprise mingled with shame It had never occurred to her that Melanie missed Atlanta so much and longed to be back longed for a home of her own She had seemed so contented at Tara it came to Scarlett as a shock that she was homesick Oh Scarlett how good of you to plan all this for us You knew how I longed for home As usual when confronted by Melanies habit of attributing worthy motives where no worth existed Scarlett was ashamed and irritated and suddenly she could not meet either Ashleys or Melanies eyes We could get a little house of our own Do you realize that weve been married five years and never had a home You can stay with us at Aunt Pittys Thats your home mumbled Scarlett toying with a pillow and keeping her eyes down to hide dawning triumph in them as she felt the tide turning her way No but thank you just the same darling That would crowd us so Well get a house Oh Ashley do say Yes Scarlett said Ashley and his voice was toneless look at me Startled she looked up and met gray eyes that were bitter and full of tired futility Scarlett I will come to Atlanta  I cannot fight you both He turned and walked out of the room Some of the triumph in her heart was dulled by a nagging fear The look in his eyes when he spoke had been the same as when he said he would be lost forever if he came to Atlanta After Suellen and Will married and Carreen went off to Charleston to the convent Ashley Melanie and Beau came to Atlanta bringing Dilcey with them to cook and nurse Prissy and Pork were left at Tara until such a time as Will could get other darkies to help him in the fields and then they too would come to town The little brick house that Ashley took for his family was on Ivy Street directly behind Aunt Pittys house and the two back yards ran together divided only by a ragged overgrown privet hedge Melanie had chosen it especially for this reason She said on the first morning of her return to Atlanta as she laughed and cried and embraced Scarlett and Aunt Pitty she had been separated from her loved ones for so long that she could never be close enough to them again The house had originally been two stories high but the upper floor had been destroyed by shells during the siege and the owner returning after the surrender had lacked the money to replace it He had contented himself with putting a flat roof on the remaining first floor which gave the building the squat disproportionate look of a childs playhouse built of shoe boxes The house was high from the ground built over a large cellar and the long sweeping flight of stairs which reached it made it look slightly ridiculous But the flat squashed look of the place was partly redeemed by the two fine old oaks which shaded it and a dustyleaved magnolia splotched with white blossoms standing beside the front steps The lawn was wide and green with thick clover and bordering it was a straggling unkempt privet hedge interlaced with sweetsmelling honeysuckle vines Here and there in the grass roses threw out sprangles from crushed old stems and pink and white crpe myrtle bloomed as valiantly as if war had not passed over their heads and Yankee horses gnawed their boughs  Page    Gone With The Wind Scarlett thought it quite the ugliest dwelling she had ever seen but to Melanie Twelve Oaks in all its grandeur had not been more beautiful It was home and she and Ashley and Beau were at last together under their own roof India Wilkes came back from Macon where she and Honey had lived since  and took up her residence with her brother crowding the occupants of the little house But Ashley and Melanie welcomed her Times had changed money was scarce but nothing had altered the rule of Southern life that families always made room gladly for indigent or unmarried female relatives Honey had married and so India said married beneath her a coarse Westerner from Mississippi who had settled in Macon He had a red face and a loud voice and jolly ways India had not approved of the match and not approving had not been happy in her brotherinlaws home She welcomed the news that Ashley now had a home of his own so she could remove herself from uncongenial surroundings and also from the distressing sight of her sister so fatuously happy with a man unworthy of her The rest of the family privately thought that the giggling and simpleminded Honey had done far better than could be expected and they marveled that she had caught any man Her husband was a gentleman and a man of some means but to India born in Georgia and reared in Virginia traditions anyone not from the eastern seaboard was a boor and a barbarian Probably Honeys husband was as happy to be relieved of her company as she was to leave him for India was not easy to live with these days The mantle of spinsterhood was definitely on her shoulders now She was twentyfive and looked it and so there was no longer any need for her to try to be attractive Her pale lashless eyes looked directly and uncompromisingly upon the world and her thin lips were ever set in haughty tightness There was an air of dignity and pride about her now that oddly enough became her better than the determined girlish sweetness of her days at Twelve Oaks The position she held was almost that of a widow Everyone knew that Stuart Tarleton would have married her had he not been killed at Gettysburg and so she was accorded the respect due a woman who had been wanted if not wed The six rooms of the little house on Ivy Street were soon scantily furnished with the cheapest pine and oak furniture in Franks store for as Ashley was penniless and forced to buy on credit he refused anything except the least expensive and bought only the barest necessities This embarrassed Frank who was fond of Ashley and it distressed Scarlett Both she and Frank would willingly have given without any charge the finest mahogany and carved rosewood in the store but the Wilkeses obstinately refused Their house was painfully ugly and bare and Scarlett hated to see Ashley living in the uncarpeted uncurtained rooms But he did not seem to notice his surroundings and Melanie having her own home for the first time since her marriage was so happy she was actually proud of the place Scarlett would have suffered agonies of humiliation at having friends find her without draperies and carpets and cushions and the proper number of chairs and teacups and spoons But Melanie did the honors of her house as though plush curtains and brocade sofas were hers For all her obvious happiness Melanie was not well Little Beau had cost her her health and the hard work she had done at Tara since his birth had taken further toll of her strength She was so thin that her small bones seemed ready to come through her white skin Seen from a distance romping about the back yard with her child she looked like a little girl for her waist was unbelievably tiny and she had practically no figure She had no bust and her hips were as flat as little Beaus and as she had neither the pride nor the good sense so Scarlett thought to sew ruffles in the bosom of her basque or pads on the back of her corsets her thinness was very obvious Like her body her face was too thin and too pale and her silky brows arched and delicate as a butterflys feelers stood out too blackly against her colorless skin In her small face her eyes were too large for beauty the dark smudges under them making them appear enormous but the expression in them had not altered since the days of her unworried girlhood War and constant pain and hard work had been powerless against their sweet tranquility They were the eyes of a happy woman a woman around whom storms might blow without ever ruffling the serene core of her being How did she keep her eyes that way thought Scarlett looking at her enviously She knew her own eyes sometimes had the look of a hungry cat What was it Rhett had said once about Melanies eyessome foolishness about them being like candles Oh yes like two good deeds in a naughty world Yes they were like candles candles shielded from every wind two soft lights glowing with happiness at being home again among her friends The little house was always full of company Melanie had been a favorite even as a child and the town flocked to welcome her home again Everyone brought presents for the house bricabrac pictures a silver spoon or two linen pillow cases napkins rag rugs small articles which they had saved from Sherman and treasured but which they now swore were of no earthly use to them Old men who had campaigned in Mexico with her father came to see her bringing visitors to meet old Colonel Hamiltons sweet daughter Her mothers old friends clustered about her for Melanie had a respectful deference to her elders that was very soothing to dowagers in these wild days when young people seemed to have forgotten all their manners Her contemporaries the young wives mothers and widows loved her because she had suffered what they had suffered had not become embittered and always lent them a sympathetic ear The young people came as young people always come simply because they had a good time at her home and met there the friends they wanted to meet Around Melanies tactful and selfeffacing person there rapidly grew up a clique of young and old who represented what was left of the best of Atlantas antebellum society all poor in purse all proud in family diehards of the stoutest variety It was as if Atlanta society scattered and wrecked by war depleted by death bewildered by change had found in her an unyielding nucleus about which it could reform Melanie was young but she had in her all the qualities this embattled remnant prized poverty and pride in poverty uncomplaining courage gaiety hospitality kindness and above all loyalty to all the old traditions Melanie refused to change refused even to admit that there was any reason to change in a changing world Under her roof the old days seemed to come back again and people took heart and felt even more contemptuous of the tide of wild life and high living that was sweeping the Carpetbaggers and newly rich Republicans along When they looked into her young face and saw there the inflexible loyalty to the old days they could forget for a moment the traitors within their own class who were causing fury fear and heartbreak And there were many such There were men of good family driven to desperation by poverty who had gone over to the enemy become Republicans and accepted positions from the conquerors so their families would not be on charity There were young exsoldiers who lacked the courage to face the long years necessary to build up fortunes These youngsters following the lead of Rhett Butter went hand in hand with the  Page    Gone With The Wind Carpetbaggers in moneymaking schemes of unsavory kinds Worst of all the traitors were the daughters of some of Atlantas most prominent families These girls who had come to maturity since the surrender had only childish memories of the war and lacked the bitterness that animated their elders They had lost no husbands no lovers They had few recollections of past wealth and splendor and the Yankee officers were so handsome and finely dressed and so carefree And they gave such splendid balls and drove such fine horses and simply worshiped Southern girls They treated them like queens and were so careful not to injure their touchy pride and after allwhy not associate with them They were so much more attractive than the town swains who dressed so shabbily and were so serious and worked so hard that they had little time to play So there had been a number of elopements with Yankee officers which broke the hearts of Atlanta families There were brothers who passed sisters on the streets and did not speak and mothers and fathers who never mentioned daughters names Remembering these tragedies a cold dread ran in the veins of those whose motto was No surrendera dread which the very sight of Melanies soft but unyielding face dispelled She was as the dowagers said such an excellent and wholesome example to the young girls of the town And because she made no parade of her virtues the young girls did not resent her It never occurred to Melanie that she was becoming the leader of a new society She only thought the people were nice to come to see her and to want her in their little sewing circles cotillion clubs and musical societies Atlanta had always been musical and loved good music despite the sneering comments of sister cities of the South concerning the towns lack of culture and there was now an enthusiastic resurrection of interest that grew stronger as the times grew harder and more tense It was easier to forget the impudent black faces in the streets and the blue uniforms of the garrison while they were listening to music Melanie was a little embarrassed to find herself at the head of the newly formed Saturday Night Musical Circle She could not account for her elevation to this position except by the fact that she could accompany anyone on the piano even the Misses McLure who were tone deaf but who would sing duets The truth of the matter was that Melanie had diplomatically managed to amalgamate the Lady Harpists the Gentlemens Glee Club and the Young Ladies Mandolin and Guitar Society with the Saturday Night Musical Circle so that now Atlanta had music worth listening to In fact the Circles rendition of The Bohemian Girl was said by many to be far superior to professional performances heard in New York and New Orleans It was after she had maneuvered the Lady Harpists into the fold that Mrs Merriwether said to Mrs Meade and Mrs Whiting that they must have Melanie at the head of the Circle If she could get on with the Harpists she could get on with anyone Mrs Merriwether declared That lady herself played the organ for the choir at the Methodist Church and as an organist had scant respect for harps or harpists Melanie had also been made secretary for both the Association for the Beautification of the Graves of Our Glorious Dead and the Sewing Circle for the Widows and Orphans of the Confederacy This new honor came to her after an exciting joint meeting of those societies which threatened to end in violence and the severance of lifelong ties of friendship The question had arisen at the meeting as to whether or not weeds should be removed from the graves of the Union soldiers near those of Confederate soldiers The appearance of the scraggly Yankee mounds defeated all the efforts of the ladies to beautify those of their own dead Immediately the fires which smoldered beneath tight basques flamed wildly and the two organizations split up and glared hostilely The Sewing Circle was in favor of the removal of the weeds the Ladies of the Beautification were violently opposed Mrs Meade expressed the views of the latter group when she said Dig up the weeds off Yankee graves For two cents Id dig up all the Yankees and throw them in the city dump At these ringing words the two associations arose and every lady spoke her mind and no one listened The meeting was being held in Mrs Merriwethers parlor and Grandpa Merriwether who had been banished to the kitchen reported afterwards that the noise sounded just like the opening guns of the battle of Franklin And he added he guessed it was a dinged sight safer to be present at the battle of Franklin than at the ladies meeting Somehow Melanie made her way to the center of the excited throng and somehow made her usually soft voice heard above the tumult Her heart was in her throat with fright at daring to address the indignant gathering and her voice shook but she kept crying Ladies Please till the din died down I want to sayI mean Ive thought for a long time thatthat not only should we pull up the weeds but we should plant flowers on II dont care what you think but every time I go to take flowers to dear Charlies grave I always put some on the grave of an unknown Yankee which is near by Itit looks so forlorn The excitement broke out again in louder words and this time the two organizations merged and spoke as one On Yankee graves Oh Melly how could you And they killed Charlie They almost killed you Why the Yankees might have killed Beau when he was born They tried to burn you out of Tara Melanie held onto the back of her chair for support almost crumpling beneath the weight of a disapproval she had never known before Oh ladies she cried pleading Please let me finish I know I havent the right to speak on this matter for none of my loved ones were killed except Charlie and I know where he lies thank God But there are so many among us today who do not know where their sons and husbands and brothers are buried and She choked and there was a dead silence in the room Mrs Meades flaming eyes went somber She had made the long trip to Gettysburg after the battle to bring back Darcys body but no one had been able to tell her where he was buried Somewhere in some hastily dug trench in the enemys country And Mrs Allans mouth quivered Her husband and brother had been on that illstarred raid Morgan made into Ohio and the last information she had of them was that they fell on the banks of the river just as the Yankee cavalry stormed up She did not know where they lay Mrs Allisons son had died in a Northern prison camp and she the poorest of the poor was unable to bring his body home There were others who had read on casualty lists Missingbelieved dead and in those words had learned the last news they were ever to learn of men they had seen march away They turned to Melanie with eyes that said Why do you open these wounds again These are the wounds that never healthe  Page    Gone With The Wind wounds of not knowing where they lie Melanies voice gathered strength in the stillness of the room Their graves are somewhere up in the Yankees country just like the Yankee graves are here and oh how awful it would be to know that some Yankee woman said to dig them up and Mrs Meade made a small dreadful sound But how nice it would be to know that some good Yankee woman And there must be some good Yankee women I dont care what people say they cant all be bad How nice it would be to know that they pulled weeds off our mens graves and brought flowers to them even if they were enemies If Charlie were dead in the North it would comfort me to know that someone And I dont care what you ladies think of me her voice broke again I will withdraw from both clubs and IllIll pull up every weed off every Yankees grave I can find and Ill plant flowers tooandI just dare anyone to stop me With this final defiance Melanie burst into tears and tried to make her stumbling way to the door Grandpa Merriwether safe in the masculine confines of the Girl of the Period Saloon an hour later reported to Uncle Henry Hamilton that after these words everybody cried and embraced Melanie and it all ended up in a love feast and Melanie was made secretary of both organizations And they are going to pull up the weeds The hell of it is Dolly said Id be only too pleased to help do it cause I didnt have anything much else to do I got nothing against the Yankees and I think Miss Melly was right and the rest of those lady wild cats wrong But the idea of me pulling weeds at my time of life and with my lumbago Melanie was on the board of lady managers of the Orphans Home and assisted in the collection of books for the newly formed Young Mens Library Association Even the Thespians who gave amateur plays once a month clamored for her She was too timid to appear behind the kerosenelamp footlights but she could make costumes out of croker sacks if they were the only material available It was she who cast the deciding vote at the Shakespeare Reading Circle that the bards works should be varied with those of Mr Dickens and Mr BulwerLytton and not the poems of Lord Byron as had been suggested by a young and Melanie privately feared very fast bachelor member of the Circle In the nights of the late summer her small feebly lighted house was always full of guests There were never enough chairs to go around and frequently ladies sat on the steps of the front porch with men grouped about them on the banisters on packing boxes or on the lawn below Sometimes when Scarlett saw guests sitting on the grass sipping tea the only refreshment the Wilkeses could afford she wondered how Melanie could bring herself to expose her poverty so shamelessly Until Scarlett was able to furnish Aunt Pittys house as it had been before the war and serve her guests good wine and juleps and baked ham and cold haunches of venison she had no intention of having guests in her houseespecially prominent guests such as Melanie had General John B Gordon Georgias great hero was frequently there with his family Father Ryan the poetpriest of the Confederacy never failed to call when passing through Atlanta He charmed gatherings there with his wit and seldom needed much urging to recite his Sword of Lee or his deathless Conquered Banner which never failed to make the ladies cry Alex Stephens late VicePresident of the Confederacy visited whenever in town and when the word went about that he was at Melanies the house was filled and people sat for hours under the spell of the frail invalid with the ringing voice Usually there were a dozen children present nodding sleepily in their parents arms up hours after their normal bedtime No family wanted its children to miss being able to say in after years that they had been kissed by the great VicePresident or had shaken the hand that helped to guide the Cause Every person of importance who came to town found his way to the Wilkes home and often they spent the night there It crowded the little flattopped house forced India to sleep on a pallet in the cubbyhole that was Beaus nursery and sent Dilcey speeding through the back hedge to borrow breakfast eggs from Aunt Pittys Cookie but Melanie entertained them as graciously as if hers was a mansion No it did not occur to Melanie that people rallied round her as round a worn and loved standard And so she was both astounded and embarrassed when Dr Meade after a pleasant evening at her house where he acquitted himself nobly in reading the part of Macbeth kissed her hand and made observations in the voice he once used in speaking of Our Glorious Cause My dear Miss Melly it is always a privilege and a pleasure to be in your home for youand ladies like youare the hearts of all of us all that we have left They have taken the flower of our manhood and the laughter of our young women They have broken our health uprooted our lives and unsettled our habits They have ruined our prosperity set us back fifty years and placed too heavy a burden on the shoulders of our boys who should be in school and our old men who should be sleeping in the sun But we will build back because we have hearts like yours to build upon And as long as we have them the Yankees can have the rest Until Scarletts figure reached such proportions that even Aunt Pittys big black shawl did not conceal her condition she and Frank frequently slipped through the back hedge to join the summernight gatherings on Melanies porch Scarlett always sat well out of the light hidden in the protecting shadows where she was not only inconspicuous but could unobserved watch Ashleys face to her hearts content It was only Ashley who drew her to the house for the conversations bored and saddened her They always followed a set patternfirst hard times next the political situation and then inevitably the war The ladies bewailed the high prices of everything and asked the gentlemen if they thought good times would ever come back And the omniscient gentlemen always said indeed they would Merely a matter of time Hard times were just temporary The ladies knew the gentlemen were lying and the gentlemen knew the ladies knew they were lying But they lied cheerfully just the same and the ladies pretended to believe them Everyone knew hard times were here to stay Once the hard times were disposed of the ladies spoke of the increasing impudence of the negroes and the outrages of the Carpetbaggers and the humiliation of having the Yankee soldiers loafing on every corner Did the gentlemen think the Yankees would ever get through with reconstructing Georgia The reassuring gentlemen thought Reconstruction would be over in no timethat is just as soon as the Democrats could vote again The ladies were considerate enough not to ask when this would be And having finished with politics the talk about the war began  Page    Gone With The Wind Whenever two former Confederates met anywhere there was never but one topic of conversation and where a dozen or more gathered together it was a foregone conclusion that the war would be spiritedly refought And always the word if had the most prominent part in the talk If England had recognized us If Jeff Davis had commandeered all the cotton and gotten it to England before the blockade tightened If Longstreet had obeyed orders at Gettysburg If Jeb Stuart hadnt been away on that raid when Marse Bob needed him If we hadnt lost Stonewall Jackson If Vicksburg hadnt fallen If we could have held on another year And always If they hadnt replaced Johnston with Hood or If theyd put Hood in command at Dalton instead of Johnston If If The soft drawling voices quickened with an old excitement as they talked in the quiet darknessinfantryman cavalryman cannoneer evoking memories of the days when life was ever at high tide recalling the fierce heat of their midsummer in this forlorn sunset of their winter They dont talk of anything else thought Scarlett Nothing but the war Always the war And theyll never talk of anything but the war No not until they die She looked about seeing little boys lying in the crooks of their fathers arms breath coming fast eyes glowing as they heard of midnight stories and wild cavalry dashes and flags planted on enemy breastworks They were hearing drums and bugles and the Rebel yell seeing footsore men going by in the rain with torn flags slanting And these children will never talk of anything else either Theyll think it was wonderful and glorious to fight the Yankees and come home blind and crippledor not come home at all They all like to remember the war to talk about it But I dont I dont even like to think about it Id forget it all if I couldoh if I only could She listened with flesh crawling as Melanie told tales of Tara making Scarlett a heroine as she faced the invaders and saved Charles sword bragging how Scarlett had put out the fire Scarlett took no pleasure or pride in the memory of these things She did not want to think of them at all Oh why cant they forget Why cant they look forward and not back We were fools to fight that war And the sooner we forget it the better well be But no one wanted to forget no one it seemed except herself so Scarlett was glad when she could truthfully tell Melanie that she was embarrassed at appearing even in the darkness This explanation was readily understood by Melanie who was hypersensitive about all matters relating to childbirth Melanie wanted another baby badly but both Dr Meade and Dr Fontaine had said another child would cost her her life So only half resigned to her fate she spent most of her time with Scarlett vicariously enjoying a pregnancy not her own To Scarlett scarcely wanting her coming child and irritated at its untimeliness this attitude seemed the height of sentimental stupidity But she had a guilty sense of pleasure that the doctors edict had made impossible any real intimacy between Ashley and his wife Scarlett saw Ashley frequently now but she never saw him alone He came by the house every night on his way home from the mill to report on the days work but Frank and Pitty were usually present or worse still Melanie and India She could only ask businesslike questions and make suggestions and then say It was nice of you to come by Good night If only she wasnt having a baby Here was a Godgiven opportunity to ride out to the mill with him every morning through the lonely woods far from prying eyes where they could imagine themselves back In the County again in the unhurried days before the war No she wouldnt try to make him say one word of love She wouldnt refer to love in any way Shed sworn an oath to herself that she would never do that again But perhaps if she were alone with him once more he might drop that mask of impersonal courtesy he had worn since coming to Atlanta Perhaps he might be his old self again be the Ashley she had known before the barbecue before any word of love had been spoken between them If they could not be lovers they could be friends again and she could warm her cold and lonely heart in the glow of his friendship If only I could get this baby over and done with she thought impatiently then I could ride with him every day and we could talk It was not only the desire to be with him that made her writhe with helpless impatience at her confinement The mills needed her The mills had been losing money ever since she retired from active supervision leaving Hugh and Ashley in charge Hugh was so incompetent for all that he tried so hard He was a poor trader and a poorer boss of labor Anyone could Jew him down on prices If any slick contractor chose to say that the lumber was of an inferior grade and not worth the price asked Hugh felt that all a gentleman could do was to apologize and take a lower price When she heard of the price he received for a thousand feet of flooring she burst into angry tears The best grade of flooring the mill had ever turned out and he had practically given it away And he couldnt manage his labor crews The negroes insisted on being paid every day and they frequently got drunk on their wages and did not turn up for work the next morning On these occasions Hugh was forced to hunt up new workmen and the mill was late in starting With these difficulties Hugh didnt get into town to sell the lumber for days on end Seeing the profits slip from Hughs fingers Scarlett became frenzied at her impotence and his stupidity Just as soon as the baby was born and she could go back to work she would get rid of Hugh and hire some one else Anyone would do better And she would never fool with free niggers again How could anyone get any work done with free niggers quitting all the time Frank she said after a stormy interview with Hugh over his missing workmen Ive about made up my mind that Ill lease convicts to work the mills A while back I was talking to Johnnie Gallegher Tommy Wellburns foreman about the trouble we were having getting any work out of the darkies and he asked me why I didnt get convicts It sounds like a good idea to me He said I could sublease them for next to nothing and feed them dirt cheap And he said I could get work out of them in any way I liked without having the Freedmans Bureau swarming down on me like hornets sticking their bills into things that arent any of their business And just as soon as Johnnie Galleghers contract with Tommy is up Im going to hire him to run Hughs mill Any man who can get work out of that bunch of wild Irish he bosses can certainly get plenty of work out of convicts Convicts Frank was speechless Leasing convicts was the very worst of all the wild schemes Scarlett had ever suggested worse even than her notion of building a saloon  Page    Gone With The Wind At least it seemed worse to Frank and the conservative circles in which he moved This new system of leasing convicts had come into being because of the poverty of the state after the war Unable to support the convicts the State was hiring them out to those needing large labor crews in the building of railroads in turpentine forests and lumber camps While Frank and his quiet churchgoing friends realized the necessity of the system they deplored it just the same Many of them had not even believed in slavery and they thought this was far worse than slavery had ever been And Scarlett wanted to lease convicts Frank knew that if she did he could never hold up his head again This was far worse than owning and operating the mills herself or anything else she had done His past objections had always been coupled with the question What will people say But thisthis went deeper than fear of public opinion He felt that it was a traffic in human bodies on a par with prostitution a sin that would be on his soul if he permitted her to do it From this conviction of wrongness Frank gathered courage to forbid Scarlett to do such a thing and so strong were his remarks that she startled relapsed into silence Finally to quiet him she said meekly she hadnt really meant it She was just so outdone with Hugh and the free niggers she had lost her temper Secretly she still thought about it and with some longing Convict labor would settle one of her hardest problems but if Frank was going to take on so about it She sighed If even one of the mills were making money she could stand it But Ashley was faring little better with his mill than Hugh At first Scarlett was shocked and disappointed that Ashley did not immediately take hold and make the mill pay double what it had paid under her management He was so smart and he had read so many books and there was no reason at all why he should not make a brilliant success and lots of money But he was no more successful than Hugh His inexperience his errors his utter lack of business judgment and his scruples about close dealing were the same as Hughs Scarletts love hastily found excuses for him and she did not consider the two men in the same light Hugh was just hopelessly stupid while Ashley was merely new at the business Still unbidden came the thought that Ashley could never make a quick estimate in his head and give a price that was correct as she could And she sometimes wondered if hed ever learn to distinguish between planking and sills And because he was a gentleman and himself trustworthy he trusted every scoundrel who came along and several times would have lost money for her if she had not tactfully intervened And if he liked a personand he seemed to like so many peoplehe sold them lumber on credit without ever thinking to find out if they had money in the bank or property He was as bad as Frank in that respect But surely he would learn And while he was learning she had a fond and maternal indulgence and patience for his errors Every evening when he called at her house weary and discouraged she was tireless in her tactful helpful suggestions But for all her encouragement and cheer there was a queer dead look in his eyes She could not understand it and it frightened her He was different so different from the man he used to be If only she could see him alone perhaps she could discover the reason The situation gave her many sleepless nights She worried about Ashley both because she knew he was unhappy and because she knew his unhappiness wasnt helping him to become a good lumber dealer It was a torture to have her mills in the hands of two men with no more business sense than Hugh and Ashley heartbreaking to see her competitors taking her best customers away when she had worked so hard and planned so carefully for these helpless months Oh if she could only get back to work again She would take Ashley in hand and then he would certainly learn And Johnnie Gallegher could run the other mill and she could handle the selling and then everything would be fine As for Hugh he could drive a delivery wagon if he still wanted to work for her That was all he was good for Of course Gallegher looked like an unscrupulous man for all of his smartness butwho else could she get Why had the other men who were both smart and honest been so perverse about working for her If she only had one of them working for her now in place of Hugh she wouldnt have to worry so much but Tommy Wellburn in spite of his crippled back was the busiest contractor in town and coining money so people said Mrs Merriwether and Ren were prospering and now had opened a bakery downtown Ren was managing it with true French thrift and Grandpa Merriwether glad to escape from his chimney corner was driving Rens pie wagon The Simmons boys were so busy they were operating their brick kiln with three shifts of labor a day And Kells Whiting was cleaning up money with his hair straightener because he told the negroes they wouldnt ever be permitted to vote the Republican ticket if they had kinky hair It was the same with all the smart young men she knew the doctors the lawyers the storekeepers The apathy which had clutched them immediately after the war had completely disappeared and they were too busy building their own fortunes to help her build hers The ones who were not busy were the men of Hughs typeor Ashleys What a mess it was to try to run a business and have a baby too Ill never have another one she decided firmly Im not going to be like other women and have a baby every year Good Lord that would mean six months out of the year when Id have to be away from the mills And I see now I cant afford to be away from them even one day I shall simply tell Frank that I wont have any more children Frank wanted a big family but she could manage Frank somehow Her mind was made up This was her last child The mills were far more important CHAPTER XLII SCARLETTS CHILD was a girl a small baldheaded mite ugly as a hairless monkey and absurdly like Frank No one except the doting father could see anything beautiful about her but the neighbors were charitable enough to say that all ugly babies turned out pretty eventually She was named Ella Lorena Ella for her grandmother Ellen and Lorena because it was the most fashionable name of the day for girls even as Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson were popular for boys and Abraham Lincoln and Emancipation for negro children She was born in the middle of a week when frenzied excitement gripped Atlanta and the air was tense with expectation of disaster A negro who had boasted of rape had actually been arrested but before he could be brought to trial the jail had been raided by the Ku Klux Klan and he had been quietly hanged The Klan had acted to save the as yet unnamed victim from having  Page    Gone With The Wind to testify in open court Rather than have her appear and advertise her shame her father and brother would have shot her so lynching the negro seemed a sensible solution to the townspeople in fact the only decent solution possible But the military authorities were in a fury They saw no reason why the girl should mind testifying publicly The soldiers made arrests right and left swearing to wipe out the Klan if they had to put every white man in Atlanta in jail The negroes frightened and sullen muttered of retaliatory house burnings The air was thick with rumors of wholesale hangings by the Yankees should the guilty parties be found and of a concerted uprising against the whites by the negroes The people of the town stayed at home behind locked doors and shuttered windows the men fearing to go to their businesses and leave their women and children unprotected Scarlett lying exhausted in bed feebly and silently thanked God that Ashley had too much sense to belong to the Klan and Frank was too old and poor spirited How dreadful it would be to know that the Yankees might swoop down and arrest them at any minute Why didnt the crackbrained young fools in the Klan leave bad enough alone and not stir up the Yankees like this Probably the girl hadnt been raped after all Probably shed just been frightened silly and because of her a lot of men might lose their lives In this atmosphere as nerve straining as watching a slow fuse burn toward a barrel of gunpowder Scarlett came rapidly back to strength The healthy vigor which had carried her through the hard days at Tara stood her in good stead now and within two weeks of Ella Lorenas birth she was strong enough to sit up and chafe at her inactivity In three weeks she was up declaring she had to see to the mills They were standing idle because both Hugh and Ashley feared to leave their families alone all day Then the blow fell Frank full of the pride of new fatherhood summoned up courage enough to forbid Scarlett leaving the house while conditions were so dangerous His commands would not have worried her at all and she would have gone about her business in spite of them if he had not put her horse and buggy in the livery stable and ordered that they should not be surrendered to anyone except himself To make matters worse he and Mammy had patiently searched the house while she was ill and unearthed her hidden store of money And Frank had deposited it in the bank in his own name so now she could not even hire a rig Scarlett raged at both Frank and Mammy then was reduced to begging and finally cried all one morning like a furious thwarted child But for all her pains she heard only There Sugar Youre just a sick little girl And Miss Scarlett ef you doan quit cahyin on so you gwine sour yo milk an de baby have colic sho as guns iron In a furious temper Scarlett charged through her back yard to Melanies house and there unburdened herself at the top of her voice declaring she would walk to the mills she would go about Atlanta telling everyone what a varmint she had married she would not be treated like a naughty simpleminded child She would carry a pistol and shoot anyone who threatened her She had shot one man and she would love yes love to shoot another She would Melanie who feared to venture onto her own front porch was appalled by such threats Oh you must not risk yourself I should die if anything happened to you Oh please I will I will I will walk Melanie looked at her and saw that this was not the hysteria of a woman still weak from childbirth There was the same breakneck headlong determination in Scarletts face that Melanie had often seen in Gerald OHaras face when his mind was made up She put her arms around Scarletts waist and held her tightly Its all my fault for not being brave like you and for keeping Ashley at home with me all this time when he should have been at the mill Oh dear Im such a ninny Darling Ill tell Ashley Im not a bit frightened and Ill come over and stay with you and Aunt Pitty and he can go back to work and Not even to herself would Scarlett admit that she did not think Ashley could cope with the situation alone and she shouted Youll do nothing of the kind What earthly good would Ashley do at work if he was worried about you every minute Everybody is just so hateful Even Uncle Peter refuses to go out with me But I dont care Ill go alone Ill walk every step of the way and pick up a crew of darkies somewhere Oh no You mustnt do that Something dreadful might happen to you They say that Shantytown settlement on the Decatur road is just full of mean darkies and youd have to pass right by it Let me think Darling promise me you wont do anything today and Ill think of something Promise me youll go home and lie down You look right peaked Promise me Because she was too exhausted by her anger to do otherwise Scarlett sulkily promised and went home haughtily refusing any overtures of peace from her household That afternoon a strange figure stumped through Melanies hedge and across Pittys back yard Obviously he was one of those men whom Mammy and Dilcey referred to as de riffraff whut Miss Melly pick up off de streets an let sleep in her cellar There were three rooms in the basement of Melanies house which formerly had been servants quarters and a wine room Now Dilcey occupied one and the other two were in constant use by a stream of miserable and ragged transients No one but Melanie knew whence they came or where they were going and no one but she knew where she collected them Perhaps the negroes were right and she did pick them up from the streets But even as the great and the near great gravitated to her small parlor so unfortunates found their way to her cellar where they were fed bedded and sent on their way with packages of food Usually the occupants of the rooms were former Confederate soldiers of the rougher illiterate type homeless men men without families beating their way about the country in hope of finding work Frequently brown and withered country women with broods of towhaired silent children spent the night there women widowed by the war dispossessed of their farms seeking relatives who were scattered and lost Sometimes the neighborhood was scandalized by the presence of foreigners speaking little or no English who had been drawn South by glowing tales of fortunes easily made Once a Republican had slept there At least Mammy insisted he was a Republican saying she could smell a Republican same as a horse could smell a rattlesnake but no one believed Mammys story for there must be some limit even to Melanies charity At least everyone hoped so Yes thought Scarlett sitting on the side porch in the pale November sunshine with the baby on her lap he is one of Melanies lame dogs And hes really lame at that  Page    Gone With The Wind The man who was making his way across the back yard stumped like Will Benteen on a wooden leg He was a tall thin old man with a bald head which shone pinkishly dirty and a grizzled beard so long he could tuck it in his belt He was over sixty to judge by his hard seamed face but there was no sag of age to his body He was lank and ungainly but even with his wooden peg he moved as swiftly as a snake He mounted the steps and came toward her and even before he spoke revealing in his tones a twang and a burring of r s unusual in the lowlands Scarlett knew that he was mountain born For all his dirty ragged clothes there was about him as about most mountaineers an air of fierce silent pride that permitted no liberties and tolerated no foolishness His beard was stained with tobacco juice and a large wad in his jaw made his face look deformed His nose was thin and craggy his eyebrows bushy and twisted into witches locks and a lush growth of hair sprang from his ears giving them the tufted look of a lynxs ears Beneath his brow was one hollow socket from which a scar ran down his cheek carving a diagonal line through his beard The other eye was small pale and cold an unwinking and remorseless eye There was a heavy pistol openly in his trouser band and from the top of his tattered boot protruded the hilt of a bowie knife He returned Scarletts stare coldly and spat across the rail of the banister before he spoke There was contempt in his one eye not a personal contempt for her but for her whole sex Miz Wilkes sont me to work for you he said shortly He spoke rustily as one unaccustomed to speaking the words coming slowly and almost with difficulty M names Archie Im sorry but I have no work for you Mr Archie Archies mfuss name I beg your pardon What is your last name He spat again I reckon thats my bizness he said Archiell do I dont care what your last name is I have nothing for you to do I reckon you have Miz Wilkes was upsot about yore wantin to run aroun like a fool by yoreself and she sont me over here to drive aroun with you Indeed cried Scarlett indignant both at the mans rudeness and Mellys meddling His one eye met hers with an impersonal animosity Yes A womans got no bizness botherin her men folks when theyre tryin to take keer of her If youre bound to gad about Ill drive you I hates niggersYankees too He shifted his wad of tobacco to the other cheek and without waiting for an invitation sat down on the top step I aint sayin I like drivin women aroun but Miz Wilkes been good to me lettin me sleep in her cellar and she sont me to drive you But began Scarlett helplessly and then she stopped and looked at him After a moment she began to smile She didnt like the looks of this elderly desperado but his presence would simplify matters With him beside her she could go to town drive to the mills call on customers No one could doubt her safety with him and his very appearance was enough to keep from giving rise to scandal Its a bargain she said That is if my husband agrees After a private conversation with Archie Frank gave his reluctant approval and sent word to the livery stable to release the horse and buggy He was hurt and disappointed that motherhood had not changed Scarlett as he had hoped it would but if she was determined to go back to her damnable mills then Archie was a godsend So began the relationship that at first startled Atlanta Archie and Scarlett were a queerly assorted pair the truculent dirty old man with his wooden peg sticking stiffly out over the dashboard and the pretty neatly dressed young woman with forehead puckered in an abstracted frown They could be seen at all hours and at all places in and near Atlanta seldom speaking to each other obviously disliking each other but bound together by mutual need he of money she of protection At least said the ladies of the town its better than riding around so brazenly with that Butler man They wondered curiously where Rhett was these days for he had abruptly left town three months before and no one not even Scarlett knew where he was Archie was a silent man never speaking unless spoken to and usually answering with grunts Every morning he came from Melanies cellar and sat on the front steps of Pittys house chewing and spitting until Scarlett came out and Peter brought the buggy from the stable Uncle Peter feared him only a little less than the devil or the Ku Klux and even Mammy walked silently and timorously around him He hated negroes and they knew it and feared him He reinforced his pistol and knife with another pistol and his fame spread far among the black population He never once had to draw a pistol or even lay his hand on his belt The moral effect was sufficient No negro dared even laugh while Archie was in hearing Once Scarlett asked him curiously why he hated negroes and was surprised when he answered for generally all questions were answered by I reckon thats my bizness I hates them like all mountain folks hates them We never liked them and we never owned none It was them niggers that started the war I hates them for that too But you fought in the war I reckon thats a mans privilege I hates Yankees too moren I hates niggers Most as much as I hates talkative women It was such outspoken rudeness as this that threw Scarlett into silent furies and made her long to be rid of him But how could she do without him In what other way could she obtain such freedom He was rude and dirty and occasionally very odorous but he served his purpose He drove her to and from the mills and on her round of customers spitting and staring off into space while she talked and gave orders If she climbed down from the buggy he climbed after her and dogged her footsteps When she was among rough laborers negroes or Yankee soldiers he was seldom more than a pace from her elbow Soon Atlanta became accustomed to seeing Scarlett and her bodyguard and from being accustomed the ladies grew to envy her her freedom of movement Since the Ku Klux lynching the ladies had been practically immured not even going to town to shop unless there were half a dozen in their group Naturally social minded they became restless and putting their pride in their pockets they began to beg the loan of Archie from Scarlett And whenever she did not need him she was gracious enough to spare him for the use of other ladies Soon Archie became an Atlanta institution and the ladies competed for his free time There was seldom a morning when a child  Page    Gone With The Wind or a negro servant did not arrive at breakfast time with a note saying If you arent using Archie this afternoon do let me have him I want to drive to the cemetery with flowers I must go to the milliners I should like Archie to drive Aunt Nelly for an airing I must go calling on Peters Street and Grandpa is not feeling well enough to take me Could Archie He drove them all maids matrons and widows and toward all he evidenced the same uncompromising contempt It was obvious that he did not like women Melanie excepted any better than he liked negroes and Yankees Shocked at first by his rudeness the ladies finally became accustomed to him and as he was so silent except for intermittent explosions of tobacco juice they took him as much for granted as the horses he drove and forgot his very existence In fact Mrs Merriwether related to Mrs Meade the complete details of her nieces confinement before she even remembered Archies presence on the front seat of the carriage At no other time than this could such a situation have been possible Before the war he would not have been permitted even in the ladies kitchens They would have handed him food through the back door and sent him about his business But now they welcomed his reassuring presence Rude illiterate dirty he was a bulwark between the ladies and the terrors of Reconstruction He was neither friend nor servant He was a hired bodyguard protecting the women while their men worked by day or were absent from home at night It seemed to Scarlett that after Archie came to work for her Frank was away at night very frequently He said the books at the store had to be balanced and business was brisk enough now to give him little time to attend to this in working hours And there were sick friends with whom he had to sit Then there was the organization of Democrats who forgathered every Wednesday night to devise ways of regaining the ballot and Frank never missed a meeting Scarlett thought this organization did little else except argue the merits of General John B Gordon over every otter general except General Lee and refight the war Certainly she could observe no progress in the direction of the recovery of the ballot But Frank evidently enjoyed the meetings for he stayed out until all hours on those nights Ashley also sat up with the sick and he too attended the Democratic meetings and he was usually away on the same nights as Frank On these nights Archie escorted Pitty Scarlett Wade and little Ella though the back yard to Melanies house and the two families spent the evenings together The ladies sewed while Archie lay full length on the parlor sofa snoring his gray whiskers fluttering at each rumble No one had invited him to dispose himself on the sofa and as it was the finest piece of furniture in the house the ladies secretly moaned every time he lay down on it planting his boot on the pretty upholstery But none of them had the courage to remonstrate with him Especially after he remarked that it was lucky he went to sleep easy for otherwise the sound of women clattering like a flock of guinea hens would certainly drive him crazy Scarlett sometimes wondered where Archie had come from and what his life had been before he came to live in Mellys cellar but she asked no questions There was that about his grim oneeyed face which discouraged curiosity All she knew was that his voice bespoke the mountains to the north and that he had been in the army and had lost both leg and eye shortly before the surrender It was words spoken in a fit of anger against Hugh Elsing which brought out the truth of Archies past One morning the old man had driven her to Hughs mill and she had found it idle the negroes gone and Hugh sitting despondently under a tree His crew had not made their appearance that morning and he was at a loss as to what to do Scarlett was in a furious temper and did not scruple to expend it on Hugh for she had just received an order for a large amount of lumbera rush order at that She had used energy and charm and bargaining to get that order and now the mill was quiet Drive me out to the other mill she directed Archie Yes I know itll take a long time and we wont get any dinner but what am I paying you for Ill have to make Mr Wilkes stop what hes doing and run me off this lumber Like as not his crew wont be working either Great balls of fire I never saw such a nincompoop as Hugh Elsing Im going to get rid of him just as soon as that Johnnie Gallegher finishes the stores hes building What do I care if Gallegher was in the Yankee Army Hell work I never saw a lazy Irishman yet And Im through with free issue darkies You just cant depend on them Im going to get Johnnie Gallegher and lease me some convicts Hell get work out of them Hell Archie turned to her his eye malevolent and when he spoke there was cold anger in his rusty voice The day you gits convicts is the day I quits you he said Scarlett was startled Good heavens Why I knows about convict leasin I calls it convict murderin Buyin men like they was mules Treatin them worse than mules ever was treated Beatin them starvin them killin them And who cares The State dont care Its got the lease money The folks that gits the convicts they dont care All they want is to feed them cheap and git all the work they can out of them Hell Mam I never thought much of women and I think less of them now Is it any of your business I reckon said Archie laconically and after a pause I was a convict for nigh on to forty years Scarlett gasped and for a moment shrank back against the cushions This then was the answer to the riddle of Archie his unwillingness to tell his last name or the place of his birth or any scrap of his past life the answer to the difficulty with which he spoke and his cold hatred of the world Forty years He must have gone into prison a young man Forty years Whyhe must have been a life prisoner and lifers were Was itmurder Yes answered Archie briefly as he flapped the reins M wife Scarletts eyelids batted rapidly with fright The mouth beneath the beard seemed to move as if he were smiling grimly at her fear I aint goin to kill you Mam if thats whats frettin you Thar aint but one reason for killin a woman You killed your wife She was layin with my brother He got away I aint sorry none that I kilt her Loose women ought to be kilt The law aint got no right to put a man in jail for that but I was sont Buthow did you get out Did you escape Were you pardoned You might call it a pardon His thick gray brows writhed together as though the effort of stringing words together was difficult  Page    Gone With The Wind  Long in sixtyfour when Sherman come through I was at Milledgeville jail like I had been for forty years And the warden he called all us prisoners together and he says the Yankees are acomin aburnin and akillin Now if thats one thing I hates worse than a nigger or a woman its a Yankee Why Had you Did you ever know any Yankees Nom But Id beam tell of them Id beam tell they couldnt never mind their own bizness I hates folks who cant mind their own bizness What was they doin in Georgia freein our niggers and burnin our houses and killin our stock Well the warden he said the army needed more soldiers bad and any of us whod jine up would be free at the end of the warif we come out alive But us lifersus murderers the warden he said the army didnt want us We was to be sont somewheres else to another jail But I said to the warden I aint like most lifers Im just in for killin my wife and she needed killin And I wants to fight the Yankees And the warden he saw my side of it and he slipped me out with the other prisoners He paused and grunted Huh That was right funny They put me in jail for killin and they let me out with a gun in my hand and a free pardon to do more killin It shore was good to be a free man with a rifle in my hand again Us men from Milledgeville did good fightin and killinand a lot of us was kilt I never knowed one who deserted And when the surrender come we was free I lost this here leg and this here eye But I aint sorry Oh said Scarlett weakly She tried to remember what she had heard about the releasing of the Milledgeville convicts in that last desperate effort to stem the tide of Shermans army Frank had mentioned it that Christmas of  What had he said But her memories of that time were too chaotic Again she felt the wild terror of those days heard the siege guns saw the line of wagons dripping blood into the red roads saw the Home Guard marching off the little cadets and the children like Phil Meade and the old men like Uncle Henry and Grandpa Merriwether And the convicts had marched out too to die in the twilight of the Confederacy to freeze in the snow and sleet of that last campaign in Tennessee For a brief moment she thought what a fool this old man was to fight for a state which had taken forty years from his life Georgia had taken his youth and his middle years for a crime that was no crime to him yet he had freely given a leg and an eye to Georgia The bitter words Rhett had spoken in the early days of the war came back to her and she remembered him saying he would never fight for a society that had made him an outcast But when the emergency had arisen he had gone off to fight for that same society even as Archie had done It seemed to her that all Southern men high or low were sentimental fools and cared less for their hides than for words which had no meaning She looked at Archies gnarled old hands his two pistols and his knife and fear pricked her again Were there other exconvicts at large like Archie murderers desperadoes thieves pardoned for their crimes in the name of the Confederacy Why any stranger on the street might be a murderer If Frank ever learned the truth about Archie there would be the devil to pay Or if Aunt Pittybut the shock would kill Pitty And as for MelanieScarlett almost wished she could tell Melanie the truth about Archie It would serve her right for picking up trash and foisting it off on her friends and relatives ImIm glad you told me Archie II wont tell anyone It would be a great shock to Mrs Wilkes and the other ladies if they knew Huh Miz Wilkes knows I told her the night she fuss let me sleep in her cellar You dont think Id let a nice lady like her take me into her house not knowin Saints preserve us cried Scarlet aghast Melanie knew this man was a murderer and a woman murderer at that and she hadnt ejected him from her house She had trusted her son with him and her aunt and sisterinlaw and all her friends And she the most timid of females had not been frightened to be alone with him in her house Miz Wilkes is right sensible for a woman She lowed that I was all right She lowed that a liar allus kept on lyin and a thief kept on stealin but folks dont do moren one murder in a lifetime And she reckoned as how anybody whod fought for the Confederacy had wiped out anything bad theyd done Though I dont hold that I done nothin bad killin my wife  Yes Miz Wilkes is right sensible for a woman  And Im tellin you the day you leases convicts is the day I quits you Scarlett made no reply but she thought The sooner you quit me the better it will suit me A murderer How could Melly have been soso Well there was no word for Melanies action in taking in this old ruffian and not telling her friends he Was a jailbird So service in the army wiped out past sins Melanie had that mixed up with baptism But then Melly was utterly silly about the Confederacy its veterans and anything pertaining to them Scarlett silently damned the Yankees and added another mark on her score against them They were responsible for a situation that forced a woman to keep a murderer at her side to protect her Driving home with Archie in the chill twilight Scarlett saw a clutter of saddle horses buggies and wagons outside the Girl of the Period Saloon Ashley was sitting on his horse a strained alert look on his face the Simmons boys were leaning from their buggy making emphatic gestures Hugh Elsing his lock of brown hair falling in his eyes was waving his hands Grandpa Merriwethers pie wagon was in the center of the tangle and as she came closer Scarlett saw that Tommy Wellburn and Uncle Henry Hamilton were crowded on the seat with him I wish thought Scarlett irritably that Uncle Henry wouldnt ride home in that contraption He ought to be ashamed to be seen in it It isnt as though he didnt have a horse of his own He just does it so he and Grandpa can go to the saloon together every night As she came abreast the crowd something of their tenseness reached her insensitive though she was and made fear clutch at her heart Oh she thought I hope no one else has been raped If the Ku Klux lynch just one more darky the Yankees will wipe us out And she spoke to Archie Pull up Somethings wrong  Page    Gone With The Wind You aint goin to stop outside a saloon said Archie You heard me Pull up Good evening everybody AshleyUncle Henryis something wrong You all look so The crowd turned to her ripping their hats and smiling but there was a driving excitement in their eyes Somethings right and somethings wrong barked Uncle Henry Depends on how you look at it The way I figure is the legislature couldnt have done different The legislature thought Scarlett in relief She had little interest in the legislature feeling that its doings could hardly affect her It was the prospect of the Yankee soldiers on a rampage again that frightened her Whats the legislature been up to now Theyve flatly refused to ratify the amendment said Grandpa Merriwether and there was pride in his voice Thatll show the Yankees And therell be hell to pay for itI beg your pardon Scarlett said Ashley Oh the amendment questioned Scarlett trying to look intelligent Politics were beyond her and she seldom wasted time thinking about them There had been a Thirteenth Amendment ratified sometime before or maybe it had been the Sixteenth Amendment but what ratification meant she had no idea Men were always getting excited about such things Something of her lack of comprehension showed in her face and Ashley smiled Its the amendment letting the darkies vote you know he explained It was submitted to the legislature and they refused to ratify it How silly of them You know the Yankees are going to force it down our throats Thats what I meant by saying thered be hell to pay said Ashley Im proud of the legislature proud of their gumption shouted Uncle Henry The Yankees cant force it down our throats if we wont have it They can and they will Ashleys voice was calm but there was worry in his eyes And itll make things just that much harder for us Oh Ashley surely not Things couldnt be any harder than they are now Yes things can get worse even worse than they are now Suppose we have a darky legislature A darky governor Suppose we have a worse military rule than we now have Scarletts eyes grew large with fear as some understanding entered her mind Ive been trying to think what would be best for Georgia best for all of us Ashleys face was drawn Whether its wisest to fight this thing like the legislature has done rouse the North against us and bring the whole Yankee Army on us to cram the darky vote down us whether we want it or not Orswallow our pride as best we can submit gracefully and get the whole matter over with as easily as possible It will amount to the same thing in the end Were helpless Weve got to take the dose theyre deter mined to give us Maybe it would be better for us to take it without kicking Scarlett hardly heard his words certainly their full import went over her head She knew that Ashley as usual was seeing both sides of a question She was seeing only one sidehow this slap in the Yankees faces might affect her Going to turn Radical and vote the Republican ticket Ashley jeered Grandpa Merriwether harshly There was a tense silence Scarlett saw Archies hand make a swift move toward his pistol and then stop Archie thought and frequently said that Grandpa was an old bag of wind and Archie had no intention of letting him insult Miss Melanies husband even if Miss Melanies husband was talking like a fool The perplexity vanished suddenly from Ashleys eyes and hot anger flared But before he could speak Uncle Henry charged Grandpa You Godyou blast I beg your pardon Scarlett Grandpa you jackass dont you say that to Ashley Ashley can take care of himself without you defending him said Grandpa coldly And he is talking like a Scalawag Submit hell I beg your pardon Scarlett I didnt believe in secession said Ashley and his voice shook with anger But when Georgia seceded I went with her And I didnt believe in war but I fought in the war And I dont believe in making the Yankees madder than they already are But if the legislature has decided to do it Ill stand by the legislature I Archie said Uncle Henry abruptly drive Miss Scarlett on home This isnt any place for her Politics arent for women folks anyway and theres going to be cussing in a minute Go on Archie Good night Scarlett As they drove off down Peachtree Street Scarletts heart was beating fast with fear Would this foolish action of the legislature have any effect on her safety Would it so enrage the Yankees that she might lose her mills Well sir rumbled Archie Ive hearn tell of rabbits spittin in bulldogs faces but I aint never seen it till now Them legislatures might just as well have hollered Hurray for Jeff Davis and the Southern Confederacy for all the good itll do themand us Them niggerlovin Yankees have made up their mind to make the niggers our bosses But you got to admire them legislatures sperrit Admire them Great balls of fire Admire them They ought to be shot Itll bring the Yankees down on us like a duck on a June bug Why couldnt they have ratiradiwhatever they were supposed to do to it and smoothed the Yankees down instead of stirring them up again Theyre going to make us knuckle under and we may as well knuckle now as later Archie fixed her with a cold eye Knuckle under without a fight Women aint got no more pride than goats When Scarlett leased ten convicts five for each of her mills Archie made good his threat and refused to have anything further to do with her Not all Melanies pleading or Franks promises of higher pay would induce him to take up the reins again He willingly escorted Melanie and Pitty and India and their friends about the town but not Scarlett He would not even drive for the other ladies if Scarlett was in the carriage It was an embarrassing situation having the old desperado sitting in judgment upon her and it was still more embarrassing to know that her family and friends agreed with the old man  Page    Gone With The Wind Frank pleaded with her against taking the step Ashley at first refused to work convicts and was persuaded against his will only after tears and supplications and promises that when times were better she would hire free darkies Neighbors were so outspoken in their disapproval that Frank Pitty and Melanie found it hard to hold up their heads Even Peter and Mammy declared that it was bad luck to work convicts and no good would come of it Everyone said it was wrong to take advantage of the miseries and misfortunes of others You didnt have any objections to working slaves Scarlett cried indignantly Ah but that was different Slaves were neither miserable nor unfortunate The negroes were far better off under slavery than they were now under freedom and if she didnt believe it just look about her But as usual opposition had the effect of making Scarlett more determined on her course She removed Hugh from the management of the mill put him to driving a lumber wagon and closed the final details of hiring Johnnie Gallegher He seemed to be the only person she knew who approved of the convicts He nodded his bullet head briefly and said it was a smart move Scarlett looking at the little exjockey planted firmly on his short bowed legs his gnomish face hard and businesslike thought Whoever let him ride their horses didnt care much for horse flesh I wouldnt let him get within ten feet of any horse of mine But she had no qualms in trusting him with a convict gang And Im to have a free hand with the gang he questioned his eyes as cold as gray agates A free hand All I ask is that you keep that mill running and deliver my lumber when I want it and as much as I want Im your man said Johnnie shortly Ill tell Mr Wellburn Im leaving him As he rolled off through the crowd of masons and carpenters and hod carriers Scarlett felt relieved and her spirits rose Johnnie was indeed her man He was tough and hard and there was no nonsense about him Shanty Irish on the make Frank had contemptuously called him but for that very reason Scarlett valued him She knew that an Irishman with a determination to get somewhere was a valuable man to have regardless of what his personal characteristics might be And she felt a closer kinship with him than with many men of her own class for Johnnie knew the value of money The first week he took over the mill he justified all her hopes for he accomplished more with five convicts than Hugh had ever done with his crew of ten free negroes More than that he gave Scarlett greater leisure than she had had since she came to Atlanta the year before because he had no liking for her presence at the mill and said so frankly You tend to your end of selling and let me tend to my end of lumbering he said shortly A convict camp aint any place for a lady and if nobody elsell tell you so Johnnie Galleghers telling you now Im delivering your lumber aint I Well Ive got no notion to be pestered every day like Mr Wilkes He needs pestering I dont So Scarlett reluctantly stayed away from Johnnies mill fearing that if she came too often he might quit and that would be ruinous His remark that Ashley needed pestering stung her for there was more truth in it than she liked to admit Ashley was doing little better with convicts than he had done with free labor although why he was unable to tell Moreover he looked as if he were ashamed to be working convicts and he had little to say to her these days Scarlett was worried by the change that was coming over him There were gray hairs in his bright head now and a tired slump in his shoulders And he seldom smiled He no longer looked the debonair Ashley who had caught her fancy so many years before He looked like a man secretly gnawed by a scarcely endurable pain and there was a grim tight look about his mouth that baffled and hurt her She wanted to drag his head fiercely down on her shoulder stroke the graying hair and cry Tell me whats worrying you Ill fix it Ill make it right for you But his formal remote air kept her at arms length CHAPTER XLIII IT WAS ONE of those rare December days when the sun was almost as warm as Indian summer Dry red leaves still clung to the oak in Aunt Pittys yard and a faint yellow green still persisted in the dying grass Scarlett with the baby in her arms stepped out onto the side porch and sat down in a rocking chair in a patch of sunshine She was wearing a new green challis dress trimmed with yards and yards of black rickrack braid and a new lace house cap which Aunt Pitty had made for her Both were very becoming to her and she knew it and took great pleasure in them How good it was to look pretty again after the long months of looking so dreadful As she sat rocking the baby and humming to herself she heard the sound of hooves coming up the side street and peering curiously through the tangle of dead vines on the porch she saw Rhett Butler riding toward the house He had been away from Atlanta for months since just after Gerald died since long before Ella Lorena was born She had missed him but she now wished ardently that there was some way to avoid seeing him In fact the sight of his dark face brought a feeling of guilty panic to her breast A matter in which Ashley was concerned lay on her conscience and she did not wish to discuss it with Rhett but she knew he would force the discussion no matter how disinclined she might be He drew up at the gate and swung lightly to the ground and she thought staring nervously at him that he looked just like an illustration in a book Wade was always pestering her to read aloud All he needs is earrings and a cutlass between his teeth she thought Well pirate or no hes not going to cut my throat today if I can help it As he came up the walk she called a greeting to him summoning her sweetest smile How lucky that she had on her new dress and the becoming cap and looked so pretty As his eyes went swiftly over her she knew he thought her pretty too A new baby Why Scarlett this is a surprise he laughed leaning down to push the blanket away from Ella Lorenas small ugly face Dont be silly she said blushing How are you Rhett Youve been away a long time So I have Let me hold the baby Scarlett Oh I know how to hold babies I have many strange accomplishments Well he certainly looks like Frank All except the whiskers but give him time  Page    Gone With The Wind I hope not Its a girl A girl Thats better still Boys are such nuisances Dont ever have any more boys Scarlett It was on the tip of her tongue to reply tartly that she never intended to have any more babies boys or girls but she caught herself in time and smiled casting about quickly in her mind for some topic of conversation that would put off the bad moment when the subject she feared would come up for discussion Did you have a nice trip Rhett Where did you go this time OhCubaNew Orleansother places Here Scarlett take the baby Shes beginning to slobber and I cant get to my handkerchief Shes a fine baby Im sure but shes wetting my shirt bosom She took the child back into her lap and Rhett settled himself lazily on the banister and took a cigar from a silver case You are always going to New Orleans she said and pouted a little And you never will tell me what you do there I am a hardworking man Scarlett and perhaps my business takes me there Hardworking You she laughed impertinently You never worked in your life Youre too lazy All you ever do is finance Carpetbaggers in their thieving and take half the profits and bribe Yankee officials to let you in on schemes to rob us taxpayers He threw back his head and laughed And how you would love to have money enough to bribe officials so you could do likewise The very idea She began to ruffle But perhaps you will make enough money to get into bribery on a large scale some day Maybe youll get rich off those convicts you leased Oh she said a little disconcerted how did you find out about my gang so soon I arrived last night and spent the evening in the Girl of the Period Saloon where one hears all the news of the town Its a clearing house for gossip Better than a ladies sewing circle Everyone told me that youd leased a gang and put that little plugugly Gallegher in charge to work them to death Thats a lie she said angrily He wont work them to death Ill see to that Will you Of course I will How can you even insinuate such things Oh I do beg your pardon Mrs Kennedy I know your motives are always above reproach However Johnnie Gallegher is a cold little bully if I ever saw one Better watch him or youll be having trouble when the inspector comes around You tend to your business and Ill tend to mine she said indignantly And I dont want to talk about convicts any more Everybodys been hateful about them My gang is my own business And you havent told me yet what you do in New Orleans You go there so often that everybody says She paused She had not intended to say so much What do they say Wellthat you have a sweetheart there That you are going to get married Are you Rhett She had been curious about this for so long that she could not refrain from asking the pointblank question A queer little pang of jealousy jabbed at her at the thought of Rhett getting married although why that should be she did not know His bland eyes grew suddenly alert and he caught her gaze and held it until a little blush crept up into her cheeks Would it matter much to you Well I should hate to lose your friendship she said primly and with an attempt at disinterestedness bent down to pull the blanket closer about Ella Lorenas head He laughed suddenly shortly and said Look at me Scarlett She looked up unwillingly her blush deepening You can tell your curious friends that when I marry it will be because I couldnt get the woman I wanted in any other way And Ive never yet wanted a woman bad enough to marry her Now she was indeed confused and embarrassed for she remembered the night on this very porch during the siege when he had said I am not a marrying man and casually suggested that she become his mistressremembered too the terrible day when he was in jail and was shamed by the memory A slow malicious smile went over his face as he read her eyes But I will satisfy your vulgar curiosity since you ask such pointed questions It isnt a sweetheart that takes me to New Orleans Its a child a little boy A little boy The shock of this unexpected information wiped out her confusion Yes he is my legal ward and I am responsible for him Hes in school in New Orleans I go there frequently to see him And take him presents So she thought thats how he always knows what kind of presents Wade likes Yes he said shortly unwillingly Well I never Is he handsome Too handsome for his own good Is he a nice little boy No Hes a perfect hellion I wish he had never been born Boys are troublesome creatures Is there anything else youd like to know He looked suddenly angry and his brow was dark as though he already regretted speaking of the matter at all Well not if you dont want to tell me any more she said loftily though she was burning for further information But I just cant see you in the rle of a guardian and she laughed hoping to disconcert him No I dont suppose you can Your vision is pretty limited He said no more and smoked his cigar in silence for a while She cast about for some remark as rude as his but could think of none I would appreciate it if youd say nothing of this to anyone he said finally Though I suppose that asking a woman to keep her mouth shut is asking the impossible I can keep a secret she said with injured dignity  Page    Gone With The Wind Can you Its nice to learn unsuspected things about friends Now stop pouting Scarlett Im sorry I was rude but you deserved it for prying Give me a smile and lets be pleasant for a minute or two before I take up an unpleasant subject Oh dear she thought Now hes going to talk about Ashley and the mill and she hastened to smile and show her dimple to divert him Where else did you go Rhett You havent been in New Orleans all this time have you No for the last month Ive been in Charleston My father died Oh Im sorry Dont be Im sure he wasnt sorry to die and Im sure Im not sorry hes dead Rhett what a dreadful thing to say It would be much more dreadful if I pretended to be sorry when I wasnt wouldnt it There was never any love lost between us I cannot remember when the old gentleman did not disapprove of me I was too much like his own father and he disapproved heartily of his father And as I grew older his disapproval of me became downright dislike which I admit I did little to change All the things Father wanted me to do and be were such boring things And finally he threw me out into the world without a cent and no training whatsoever to be anything but a Charleston gentleman a good pistol shot and an excellent poker player And he seemed to take it as a personal affront that I did not starve but put my poker playing to excellent advantage and supported myself royally by gambling He was so affronted at a Butler becoming a gambler that when I came home for the first time he forbade my mother to see me And all during the war when I was blockading out of Charleston Mother had to lie and slip off to see me Naturally that didnt increase my love for him Oh I didnt know all that He was what is pointed out as a fine old gentleman of the old school which means that he was ignorant thick headed intolerant and incapable of thinking along any lines except what other gentlemen of the old school thought Everyone admired him tremendously for having cut me off and counted me as dead If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out I was his right eye his oldest son and he plucked me out with a vengeance He smiled a little his eyes hard with amused memory Well I could forgive all that but I cant forgive what hes done to Mother and my sister since the war ended Theyve been practically destitute The plantation house was burned and the rice fields have gone back to marsh lands And the town house went for taxes and theyve been living in two rooms that arent fit for darkies Ive sent money to Mother but Father has sent it backtainted money you seeand several times Ive gone to Charleston and given money on the sly to my sister But Father always found out and raised merry hell with her till her life wasnt worth living poor girl And back the money came to me I dont know how theyve lived  Yes I do know My brothers given what he could though he hasnt much to give and he wont take anything from me eitherspeculators money is unlucky money you see And the charity of their friends Your Aunt Eulalie shes been very kind Shes one of Mothers best friends you know Shes given them clothes and Good God My mother on charity It was one of the few times she had ever seen him with his mask off his face hard with honest hatred for his father and distress for his mother Aunt Lalie But good Heavens Rhett she hasnt got anything much above what I send her Ah so thats where it comes from How ill bred of you my dear to brag of such a thing in the face of my humiliation You must let me reimburse you With pleasure said Scarlett her mouth suddenly twisting into a grin and he smiled back Ah Scarlett how the thought of a dollar does make your eyes sparkle Are you sure you havent some Scotch or perhaps Jewish blood as well as Irish Dont be hateful I didnt mean to throw it in your face about Aunt Lalie But honestly she thinks Im made of money Shes always writing me for more and God knows Ive got enough on my hands without supporting all of Charleston What did your father die of Genteel starvation I thinkand hope It served him right He was willing to let Mother and Rosemary starve with him Now that hes dead I can help them Ive bought them a house on the Battery and theyve servants to look after them But of course they couldnt let it be known that the money came from me Why not My dear surely you know Charleston Youve visited there My family may be poor but they have a position to uphold And they couldnt uphold it if it were known that gambling money and speculators money and Carpetbag money was behind it No they gave it out that Father left an enormous life insurancethat hed beggared himself and starved himself to death to keep up the payments so that after he died theyd be provided for So he is looked upon as an even greater gentleman of the old school than before  In fact a martyr to his family I hope hes turning in his grave at the knowledge that Mother and Rosemary are comfortable now in spite of his efforts  In a way Im sorry hes dead because he wanted to die was so glad to die Why Oh he really died when Lee surrendered You know the type He never could adjust himself to the new times and spent his time talking about the good old days Rhett are all old folks like that She was thinking of Gerald and what Will had said about him Heavens no Just look at your Uncle Henry and that old wild cat Mr Merriwether just to name two They took a new lease on life when they marched out with the Home Guard and it seems to me that theyve gotten younger and more peppery ever since I met old man Merriwether this morning driving Rens pie wagon and cursing the horse like an army mule skinner He told me he felt ten years younger since he escaped from the house and his daughterinlaws coddling and took to driving the wagon And your Uncle Henry enjoys fighting the Yankees in court and out and defending the widow and the orphanfree of charge I fearagainst the Carpetbaggers If there hadnt been a war hed have retired long ago and nursed his rheumatism Theyre young again because they are of use again and feel that they are needed And they like this new day that gives old men another chance But there are plenty of people young people who feel like my father and your father They cant and wont adjust and  Page    Gone With The Wind that brings me to the unpleasant subject I want to discuss with you Scarlett His sudden shift so disconcerted her that she stammered Whatwhat and inwardly groaned Oh Lord Now its coming I wonder if I can butter him down I shouldnt have expected either truth or honor or fair dealing from you knowing you as I do But foolishly I trusted you I dont know what you mean I think you do At any rate you look very guilty As I was riding along Ivy Street a white ago on my way to call on you who should hail me from behind a hedge but Mrs Ashley Wilkes Of course I stopped and chatted with her Indeed Yes we had an enjoyable talk She told me she had always wanted to let me know how brave she thought I was to have struck a blow for the Confederacy even at the eleventh hour Oh fiddledeedee Mellys a fool She might have died that night because you acted so heroic I imagine she would have thought her life given in a good cause And when I asked her what she was doing in Atlanta she looked quite surprised at my ignorance and told me that they were living here now and that you had been kind enough to make Mr Wilkes a partner in your mill Well what of it questioned Scarlett shortly When I lent you the money to buy that mill I made one stipulation to which you agreed and that was that it should not go to the support of Ashley Wilkes You are being very offensive Ive paid you back your money and I own the mill and what I do with it is my own business Would you mind telling me how you made the money to pay back my loan I made it selling lumber of course You made it with the money I lent you to give you your start Thats what you mean My money is being used to support Ashley You are a woman quite without honor and if you hadnt repaid my loan Id take great pleasure in calling it in now and selling you out at public auction if you couldnt pay He spoke lightly but there was anger flickering in his eyes Scarlett hastily carried the warfare into the enemys territory Why do you hate Ashley so much I believe youre jealous of him After she had spoken she could have bitten her tongue for he threw back his head and laughed until she went red with mortification Add conceit to dishonor he said Youll never get over being the belle of the County will you Youll always think youre the cutest little trick in shoe leather and that every man you meet is expiring for love of you I dont either she cried hotly But I just cant see why you hate Ashley so much and thats the only explanation I can think of Well think something else pretty charmer for thats the wrong explanation And as for hating Ashley I dont hate him any more than I like him In fact my only emotion toward him and his kind is pity Pity Yes and a little contempt Now swell up like a gobbler and tell me that he is worth a thousand blackguards like me and that I shouldnt dare to be so presumptuous as to feel either pity or contempt for him And when you have finished swelling Ill tell you what I mean if youre interested Well Im not I shall tell you just the same for I cant bear for you to go on nursing your pleasant delusion of my jealousy I pity him because he ought to be dead and he isnt And I have a contempt for him because he doesnt know what to do with himself now that his world is gone There was something familiar in the idea he expressed She had a confused memory of having beard similar words but she could not remember when and where She did not think very hard about it for her anger was hot If you had your way all the decent men in the South would be dead And if they had their way I think Ashleys kind would prefer to be dead Dead with neat stones above them saying Here lies a soldier of the Confederacy dead for the Southland or Dulce et decorum est or any of the other popular epitaphs I dont see why You never see anything that isnt written in letters a foot high and then shoved under your nose do you If they were dead their troubles would be over thered be no problems to face problems that have no solutions Moreover their families would be proud of them through countless generations And Ive heard the dead are happy Do you suppose Ashley Wilkes is happy Why of course she began and then she remembered the look in Ashleys eyes recently and stopped Is he happy or Hugh Elsing or Dr Meade Any more than my father and your father were happy Well perhaps not as happy as they might be because theyve all lost their money He laughed It isnt losing their money my pet I tell you its losing their worldthe world they were raised in Theyre like fish out of water or cats with wings They were raised to be certain persons to do certain things to occupy certain niches And those persons and things and niches disappeared forever when General Lee arrived at Appomattox Oh Scarlett dont look so stupid What is there for Ashley Wilkes to do now that his home is gone and his plantation taken up for taxes and fine gentlemen are going twenty for a penny Can he work with his head or his hands Ill bet youve lost money hand over fist since he took over that mill I have not How nice May I look over your books some Sunday evening when you are at leisure You can go to the devil and not at your leisure You can go now for all I care My pet Ive been to the devil and hes a very dull fellow I wont go there again even for you  You took my money when  Page    Gone With The Wind you needed it desperately and you used it We had an agreement as to how it should be used and you have broken that agreement Just remember my precious little cheat the time will come when you win want to borrow more money from me Youll want me to bank you at some incredibly low interest so you can buy more mills and more mules and build more saloons And you can whistle for the money When I need money Ill borrow it from the bank thank you she said coldly but her breast was heaving with rage Will you Try to do it I own plenty of stock in the bank You do Yes I am interested in some honest enterprises There are other banks Plenty of them And if I can manage it youll play hell getting a cent from any of them You can go to the Carpetbag usurers if you want money Ill go to them with pleasure Youll go but with little pleasure when you learn their rates of interest My pretty there are penalties in the business world for crooked dealing You should have played straight with me Youre a fine man arent you So rich and powerful yet picking on people who are down like Ashley and me Dont put yourself in his class You arent down Nothing will down you But he is down and hell stay there unless theres some energetic person behind him guiding and protecting him as long as he lives Im of no mind to have my money used for the benefit of such a person You didnt mind helping me and I was down and You were a good risk my dear an interesting risk Why Because you didnt plump yourself down on your male relatives and sob for the old days You got out and hustled and now your fortunes are firmly planted on money stolen from a dead mans wallet and money stolen from the Confederacy Youve got murder to your credit and husband stealing attempted fornication lying and sharp dealing and any amount of chicanery that wont bear close inspection Admirable things all of them They show you to be a person of energy and determination and a good money risk Its entertaining helping people who help themselves Id lend ten thousand dollars without even a note to that old Roman matron Mrs Merriwether She started with a basket of pies and look at her now A bakery employing half a dozen people old Grandpa happy with his delivery wagon and that lazy little Creole Ren working hard and liking it  Or that poor devil Tommy Wellburn who does two mens work with half a mans body and does it well orwell I wont go on and bore you You do bore me You bore me to distraction said Scarlett coldly hoping to annoy him and divert him from the everunfortunate subject of Ashley But he only laughed shortly and refused to take up the gauntlet People like them are worth helping But Ashley Wilkesbah His breed is of no use or value in an upsidedown world like ours Whenever the world upends his kind is the first to perish And why not They dont deserve to survive because they wont fightdont know how to fight This isnt the first time the worlds been upside down and it wont be the last Its happened before and itll happen again And when it does happen everyone loses everything and everyone is equal And then they all start again at taw with nothing at all That is nothing except the cunning of their brains and strength of their hands But some people like Ashley have neither cunning nor strength or having them scruple to use them And so they go under and they should go under Its a natural law and the world is better off without them But there are always a hardy few who come through and given time they are right back where they were before the world turned over Youve been poor You just said that your father turned you out without a penny said Scarlett furious I should think youd understand and sympathize with Ashley I do understand said Rhett but Im damned if I sympathize After the surrender Ashley had much more than I had when I was thrown out At least he had friends who took him in whereas I was Ishmael But what has Ashley done with himself If you are comparing him with yourself you conceited thing why Hes not like you thank God He wouldnt soil his hands as you do making money with Carpetbaggers and Scalawags and Yankees Hes scrupulous and honorable But not too scrupulous and honorable to take aid and money from a woman What else could he have done Who am I to say I only know what I did both when I was thrown out and nowadays I only know what other men have done We saw opportunity in the ruin of a civilization and we made the most of our opportunity some honestly some shadily and we are still making the most of it But the Ashleys of this world have the same chances and dont take them They just arent smart Scarlett and only the smart deserve to survive She hardly heard what he was saying for now there was coming back to her the exact memory which had teased her a few minutes before when he first began speaking She remembered the cold wind that swept the orchard of Tara and Ashley standing by a pile of rails his eyes looking beyond her And he had saidwhat Some funny foreign name that sounded like profanity and had talked of the end of the world She had not known what he meant then but now bewildered comprehension was coming to her and with it a sick weary feeling Why Ashley said Yes Once at Tara he said something about theadusk of the gods and about the end of the world and some such foolishness Ah the Gtterdmmerung Rhetts eyes were sharp with interest And what else Oh I dont remember exactly I wasnt paying much mind Butyessomething about the strong coining through and the weak being winnowed out Ah so he knows Then that makes it harder for him Most of them dont know and will never know Theyll wonder all their lives where the lost enchantment has vanished Theyll simply suffer in proud and incompetent silence But he understands He knows hes winnowed out Oh he isnt Not while Ive got breath in my body  Page    Gone With The Wind He looked at her quietly and his brown face was smooth Scarlett how did you manage to get his consent to come to Atlanta and take over the mill Did he struggle very hard against you She had a quick memory of the scene with Ashley after Geralds funeral and put it from her Why of course not she replied indignantly When I explained to him that I needed his help because I didnt trust that scamp who was running the mill and Frank was too busy to help me and I was going towell there was Ella Lorena you see He was very glad to help me out Sweet are the uses of motherhood So thats how you got around him Well youve got him where you want him now poor devil as shackled to you by obligations as any of your convicts are by their chains And I wish you both joy But as I said at the beginning of this discussion youll never get another cent out of me for any of your little unladylike schemes my doubledealing lady She was smarting with anger and with disappointment as well For some time she had been planning to borrow more money from Rhett to buy a lot downtown and start a lumber yard there I can do without your money she cried Im making money out of Johnnie Galleghers mill plenty of it now that I dont use free darkies and I have some money out on mortgages and we are coining cash at the store from the darky trade Yes so I heard How clever of you to rook the helpless and the widow and the orphan and the ignorant But if you must steal Scarlett why not steal from the rich and strong instead of the poor and weak From Robin Hood on down to now thats been considered highly moral Because said Scarlett shortly its a sight easier and safer to stealas you call itfrom the poor He laughed silently his shoulders shaking Youre a fine honest rogue Scarlett A rogue Queer that that term should hurt She wasnt a rogue she told herself vehemently At least that wasnt what she wanted to be She wanted to be a great lady For a moment her mind went swiftly down the years and she saw her mother moving with a sweet swish of skirts and a faint fragrance of sachet her small busy hands tireless in the service of others loved respected cherished And suddenly her heart was sick If you are trying to devil me she said tiredly its no use I know Im not asscrupulous as I should be these days Not as kind and as pleasant as I was brought up to be But I cant help it Rhett Truly I cant What else could I have done What would have happened to me to Wade to Tara and all of us if Id beengentle when that Yankee came to Tara I should have beenbut I dont even want to think of that And when Jonas Wilkerson was going to take the home place suppose Id beenkind and scrupulous Where would we all be now And if Id been sweet and simple minded and not nagged Frank about bad debts wedoh well Maybe I am a rogue but I wont be a rogue forever Rhett But during these past yearsand even nowwhat else could I have done How else could I have acted Ive felt that I was trying to row a heavily loaded boat in a storm Ive had so much trouble just trying to keep afloat that I couldnt be bothered about things that didnt matter things I could part with easily and not miss like good manners andwell things like that Ive been too afraid my boat would be swamped and so Ive dumped overboard the things that seemed least important Pride and honor and truth and virtue and kindliness he enumerated silkily You are right Scarlett They arent important when a boat is sinking But look around you at your friends Either they are bringing their boats ashore safely with cargoes intact or they are content to go down with all flags flying They are a passel of fools she said shortly Theres a time for all things When Ive got plenty of money Ill be nice as you please too Butter wont melt in my mouth I can afford to be then You can afford to bebut you wont Its hard to salvage jettisoned cargo and if it is retrieved its usually irreparably damaged And I fear that when you can afford to fish up the honor and virtue and kindness youve thrown overboard youll find they have suffered a sea change and not I fear into something rich and strange  He rose suddenly and picked up his hat You are going Yes Arent you relieved I leave you to what remains of your conscience He paused and looked down at the baby putting out a finger for the child to grip I suppose Frank is bursting with pride Oh of course Has a lot of plans for this baby I suppose Oh well you know how silly men are about their babies Then tell him said Rhett and stopped short an odd look on his face tell him if he wants to see his plans for his child work out hed better stay home at night more often than hes doing What do you mean Just what I say Tell him to stay home Oh you vile creature To insinuate that poor Frank would Oh good Lord Rhett broke into a roar of laughter I didnt mean he was running around with women Frank Oh good Lord He went down the steps still laughing CHAPTER XLIV THE MARCH AFTERNOON was windy and cold and Scarlett pulled the lap robe high under her arms as she drove out the Decatur road toward Johnnie Galleghers mill Driving alone was hazardous these days and she knew it more hazardous than ever before for now the negroes were completely out of hand As Ashley had prophesied there had been hell to pay since the  Page    Gone With The Wind legislature refused to ratify the amendment The stout refusal had been like a slap in the face of the furious North and retaliation had come swiftly The North was determined to force the negro vote on the state and to this end Georgia had been declared in rebellion and put under the strictest martial law Georgias very existence as a state had been wiped out and it had be come with Florida and Alabama Military District Number Three under the command of a Federal general If life had been insecure and frightening before this it was doubly so now The military regulations which had seemed so stringent the year before were now mild by comparison with the ones issued by General Pope Confronted with the prospect of negro rule the future seemed dark and hopeless and the embittered state smarted and writhed helplessly As for the negroes their new importance went to their heads and realizing that they had the Yankee Army behind them their outrages increased No one was safe from them In this wild and fearful time Scarlett was frightenedfrightened but determined and she still made her rounds alone with Franks pistol tucked in the upholstery of the buggy She silently cursed the legislature for bringing this worse disaster upon them all What good had it done this fine brave stand this gesture which everyone called gallant It had just made matters so much worse As she drew near the path that led down through the bare trees into the creek bottom where the Shantytown settlement was she clucked to the horse to quicken his speed She always felt uneasy driving past this dirty sordid cluster of discarded army tents and slave cabins It had the worst reputation of any spot in or near Atlanta for here lived in filth outcast negroes black prostitutes and a scattering of poor whites of the lowest order It was rumored to be the refuge of negro and white criminals and was the first place the Yankee soldiers searched when they wanted a man Shootings and cuttings went on here with such regularity that the authorities seldom troubled to investigate and generally left the Shantytowners to settle their own dark affairs Back in the woods there was a still that manufactured a cheap quality of corn whisky and by night the cabins in the creek bottoms resounded with drunken yells and curses Even the Yankees admitted that it was a plague spot and should be wiped out but they took no steps in this direction Indignation was loud among the inhabitants of Atlanta and Decatur who were forced to use the road for travel between the two towns Men went by Shantytown with their pistols loosened in their holsters and nice women never willingly passed it even under the protection of their men for usually there were drunken negro slatterns sitting along the road hurling insults and shouting coarse words As long as she had Archie beside her Scarlett had not given Shantytown a thought because not even the most impudent negro woman dared laugh in her presence But since she had been forced to drive alone there had been any number of annoying maddening incidents The negro sluts seemed to try themselves whenever she drove by There was nothing she could do except ignore them and boil with rage She could not even take comfort in airing her troubles to her neighbors or family because the neighbors would say triumphantly Well what else did you expect And her family would take on dreadfully again and try to stop her And she had no intention of stopping her trips Thank Heaven there were no ragged women along the roadside today As she passed the trail leading down to the settlement she looked with distaste at the group of shacks squatting in the hollow in the dreary slant of the afternoon sun There was a chill wind blowing and as she passed there came to her nose the mingled smells of wood smoke frying pork and untended privies Averting her nose she flapped the reins smartly across the horses back and hurried him past and around the bend of the road Just as she was beginning to draw a breath of relief her heart rose in her throat with sudden fright for a huge negro slipped silently from behind a large oak tree She was frightened but not enough to lose her wits and in an instant the horse was pulled up and she had Franks pistol in her hand What do you want she cried with all the sternness she could muster The big negro ducked back behind the oak and the voice that answered was frightened Lawd Miss Scarlett doan shoot Big Sam Big Sam For a moment she could not take in his words Big Sam the foreman of Tara whom she had seen last in the days of the siege What on earth  Come out of there and let me see if you are really Sam Reluctantly he slid out of his hiding place a giant ragged figure barefooted clad in denim breeches and a blue Union uniform jacket that was far too short and tight for his big frame When she saw it was really Big Sam she shoved the pistol down into the upholstery and smiled with pleasure Oh Sam How nice to see you Sam galloped over to the buggy his eyes rolling with joy and his white teeth flashing and clutched her outstretched hand with two black hands as big as hams His watermelonpink tongue lapped out his whole body wiggled and his joyful contortions were as ludicrous as the gambolings of a mastiff Mah Lawd it sho is good ter see some of de fambly agin he cried scrunching her hand until she felt that the bones would crack Huccome you got so mean lak totin a gun Miss Scarlett So many mean folks these days Sam that I have to tote it What on earth are you doing in a nasty place like Shantytown you a respectable darky And why havent you been into town to see me Lawm

it to see if the bones were intact  Member wen you seed me las Scarlett remembered the hot day before the siege began when she and Rhett had sat in the carriage and the gang of negroes with Big Sam at their head had marched down the dusty street toward the entrenchments singing Go Down Moses She nodded Wel Ah wuked lak a dawg diggin bresswuks an fillin san bags tell de Confedruts lef Lanta De capn

me Ah spec Ahs de bigges nigger in Lanta Dey done been out hyah already affer me las night but a nigger gal she hid me in a cabe ober in de woods tell dey wuz gone Scarlett sat frowning for a moment She was not in the least alarmed or distressed that Sam had committed murder but she was disappointed that she could not have him as a driver A big negro like Sam would be as good a bodyguard as Archie Well she  Page    Gone With The Wind must get him safe to Tara somehow for of course the authorities must not get him He was too valuable a darky to be hanged Why he was the best foreman Tara had ever had It did not enter Scarletts mind that he was free He still belonged to her like Pork and Mammy and Peter and Cookie and Prissy He was still one of our family and as such must be protected Ill send you to Tara tonight she said finally Now Sam Ive got to drive out the road a piece but I ought to be back here before sundown You be waiting here for me when I come back Dont tell anyone where you are going and if youve got a hat bring it along to hide your face Ah ain got no hat Well heres a quarter You buy a hat from one of those shanty darkies and meet me here Yasm His face glowed with relief at once more having someone to tell him what to do Scarlett drove on thoughtfully Will would certainly welcome a good field hand at Tara Pork had never been any good in the fields and never would be any good With Sam on the place Pork could come to Atlanta and join Dilcey as she had promised him when Gerald died When she reached the mill the sun was setting and it was later than she cared to be out Johnnie Gallegher was standing in the doorway of the miserable shack that served as cook room for the little lumber camp Sitting on a log in front of the slabsided shack that was their sleeping quarters were four of the five convicts Scarlett had apportioned to Johnnies mill Their convict uniforms were dirty and foul with sweat shackles clanked between their ankles when they moved tiredly and there was an air of apathy and despair about them They were a thin unwholesome lot Scarlett thought peering sharply at them and when she had leased them so short a time before they were an upstanding crew They did not even raise their eyes as she dismounted from the buggy but Johnnie turned toward her carelessly dragging off his hat His little brown face was as hard as a nut as he greeted her I dont like the look of the men she said abruptly They dont look well Wheres the other one Says hes sick said Johnnie laconically Hes in the bunk house What ails him Laziness mostly Ill go see him Dont do that Hes probably nekkid Ill tend to him Hell be back at work tomorrow Scarlett hesitated and saw one of the convicts raise a weary head and give Johnnie a stare of intense hatred before he looked at the ground again Have you been whipping these men Now Mrs Kennedy begging your pardon whos running this mill You put me in charge and told me to run it You said Id have a free hand You aint got no complaints to make of me have you Aint I making twice as much for you as Mr Elsing did Yes you are said Scarlett but a shiver went over her like a goose walking across her grave There was something sinister about this camp with its ugly shacks something which had not been here when Hugh Elsing had it There was a loneliness an isolation about it that chilled her These convicts were so far away from everything so completely at the mercy of Johnnie Gallegher and if he chose to whip them or otherwise mistreat them she would probably never know about it The convicts would be afraid to complain to her for fear of worse punishment after she was gone The men look thin Are you giving them enough to eat God knows I spend enough money on their food to make them fat as hogs The flour and pork alone cost thirty dollars last month What are you giving them for supper She stepped over to the cook shack and looked in A fat mulatto woman who was leaning over a rusty old stove dropped a half curtsy as she saw Scarlett and went on stirring a pot in which blackeyed peas were cooking Scarlett knew Johnnie Gallegher lived with her but thought it best to ignore the fact She saw that except for the peas and a pan of corn pone there was no other food being prepared Havent you got anything else for these men Nom Havent you got any side meat in these peas Nom No boiling bacon in the peas But blackeyed peas are no good without bacon Theres no strength to them Why isnt there any bacon Mist Johnnie he say dar ain no use puttin in no side meat Youll put bacon in Where do you keep your supplies The negro woman rolled frightened eyes toward the small closet that served as a pantry and Scarlett threw the door open There was an open barrel of cornmeal on the floor a small sack of flour a pound of coffee a little sugar a gallon jug of sorghum and two hams One of the hams sitting on the shelf had been recently cooked and only one or two slices had been cut from it Scarlett turned in a fury on Johnnie Gallegher and met his coldly angry gaze Where are the five sacks of white flour I sent out last week And the sugar sack and the coffee And I had five hams sent and ten pounds of side meat and God knows how many bushels of yams and Irish potatoes Well where are they You cant have used them all in a week if you fed the men five meals a day Youve sold them Thats what youve done you thief Sold my good supplies and put the money in your pocket and fed these men on dried peas and corn pone No wonder they look so thin Get out of the way She stormed past him to the doorway You man there on the endyes you Come here The man rose and walked awkwardly toward her his shackles clanking and she saw that his bare ankles were red and raw from the chafing of the iron When did you last have ham The man looked down at the ground Speak up  Page    Gone With The Wind Still the man stood silent and abject Finally he raised his eyes looked Scarlett in the face imploringly and dropped his gaze again Scared to talk eh Well go in the pantry and get that ham off the shelf Rebecca give him your knife Take it out to those men and divide it up Rebecca make some biscuits and coffee for the men And serve plenty of sorghum Start now so I can see you do it Dats Mist Johnnies privut flour an coffee Rebecca muttered frightenedly Mr Johnnies my foot I suppose its his private ham too You do what I say Get busy Johnnie Gallegher come out to the buggy with me She stalked across the littered yard and climbed into the buggy noticing with grim satisfaction that the men were tearing at the ham and cramming bits into their mouths voraciously They looked as if they feared it would be taken from them at any minute You are a rare scoundrel she cried furiously to Johnnie as he stood at the wheel his hat pushed back from his lowering brow And you can just hand over to me the price of my supplies In the future Ill bring you provisions every day instead of ordering them by the month Then you cant cheat me In the future I wont be here said Johnnie Gallegher You mean you are quitting For a moment it was on Scarletts hot tongue to cry Go and good riddance but the cool hand of caution stopped her If Johnnie should quit what would she do He had been doubling the amount of lumber Hugh turned out And just now she had a big order the biggest she had ever had and a rush order at that She had to get that lumber into Atlanta If Johnnie quit whom would she get to take over the mill Yes Im quitting You put me in complete charge here and you told me that all you expected of me was as much lumber as I could possibly get out You didnt tell me how to run my business then and Im not aiming to have you start now How I get the lumber out is no affair of yours You cant complain that Ive fallen down on my bargain Ive made money for you and Ive earned my salaryand what I could pick up on the side too And here you come out here interfering asking questions and breaking my authority in front of the men How can you expect me to keep discipline after this What if the men do get an occa sional lick The lazy scum deserve worse What if they aint fed up and pampered They dont deserve nothing better Either you tend to your business and let me tend to mine or I quit tonight His hard little face looked flintier than ever and Scarlett was in a quandary If he quit tonight what would she do She couldnt stay here all night guarding the convicts Something of her dilemma showed in her eyes for Johnnies expression changed subtly and some of the hardness went out of his face There was an easy agreeable note in his voice when he spoke Its getting late Mrs Kennedy and youd better be getting on home We aint going to fall out over a little thing like this are we Spose you take ten dollars out of my next months wages and lets call it square Scarletts eyes went unwillingly to the miserable group gnawing on the ham and she thought of the sick man lying in the windy shack She ought to get rid of Johnnie Gallegher He was a thief and a brutal man There was no telling what he did to the convicts when she wasnt there But on the other hand he was smart and God knows she needed a smart man Well she couldnt part with him now He was making money for her Shed just have to see to it that the convicts got their proper rations in the future Ill take twenty dollars out of your wages she said shortly and Ill be back and discuss the matter further in the morning She picked up the reins But she knew there would be no further discussion She knew that the matter had ended there and she knew Johnnie knew it As she drove off down the path to the Decatur road her conscience battled with her desire for money She knew she had no business exposing human lives to the hard little mans mercies If he should cause the death of one of them she would be as guilty as he was for she had kept him in charge after learning of his brutalities But on the other handwell on the other hand men had no business getting to be convicts If they broke laws and got caught then they deserved what they got This partly salved her conscience but as she drove down the road the dull thin faces of the convicts would keep coming back into her mind Oh Ill think of them later she decided and pushed the thought into the lumber room of her mind and shut the door upon it The sun had completely gone when she reached the bend in the road above Shantytown and the woods about her were dark With the disappearance of the sun a bitter chill had fallen on the twilight world and a cold wind blew through the dark woods making the bare boughs crack and the dead leaves rustle She had never been out this late by herself and she was uneasy and wished herself home Big Sam was nowhere to be seen and as she drew rein to wait for him she worried about his absence fearing the Yankees might have already picked him up Then she heard footsteps coming up the path from the settlement and a sigh of relief went through her lips Shed certainly dress Sam down for keeping her waiting But it wasnt Sam who came round the bend It was a big ragged white man and a squat black negro with shoulders and chest like a gorilla Swiftly she flapped the reins on the horses back and clutched the pistol The horse started to trot and suddenly shied as the white man threw up his hand Lady he said can you give me a quarter Im sure hungry Get out of the way she answered keeping her voice as steady as she could I havent got any money Giddap With a sudden swift movement the mans hand was on the horses bridle Grab her he shouted to the negro Shes probably got her money in her bosom What happened next was like a nightmare to Scarlett and it all happened so quickly She brought up her pistol swiftly and some instinct told her not to fire at the white man for fear of shooting the horse As the negro came running to the buggy his black face twisted in a leering grin she fired pointblank at him Whether or not she hit him she never knew but the next minute the pistol was wrenched from her hand by a grasp that almost broke her wrist The negro was beside her so close that she could smell the rank odor of him as he tried to drag her over the buggy side With her one free hand she fought madly clawing at his face and  Page    Gone With The Wind then she felt his big hand at her throat and with a ripping noise her basque was torn open from neck to waist Then the black hand fumbled between her breasts and terror and revulsion such as she had never known came over her and she screamed like an insane woman Shut her up Drag her out cried the white man and the black hand fumbled across Scarletts face to her mouth She bit as savagely as she could and then screamed again and through her screaming she heard the white man swear and realized that there was a third man in the dark road The black hand dropped from her mouth and the negro leaped away as Big Sam charged at him Run Miss Scarlett yelled Sam grappling with the negro and Scarlett shaking and screaming clutched up the reins and whip and laid them both over the horse It went off at a jump and she felt the wheels pass over something soft something resistant It was the white man who lay in the road where Sam had knocked him down Maddened by terror she lashed the horse again and again and it struck a gait that made the buggy rock and sway Through her terror she was conscious of the sound of feet running behind her and she screamed at the horse to go faster If that black ape got her again she would die before he even got his hands upon her A voice yelled behind her Miss Scarlett Stop Without slacking she looked trembling over her shoulder and saw Big Sam racing down the road behind her his long legs working like harddriven pistons She drew rein as he came up and he flung himself into the buggy his big body crowding her to one side Sweat and blood were streaming down his face as he panted Is you hut Did dey hut you She could not speak but seeing the direction of his eyes and their quick averting she realized that her basque was open to the waist and her bare bosom and corset cover were showing With a shaking hand she clutched the two edges together and bowing her head began to cry in terrified sobs Gimme dem lines said Sam snatching the reins from her Hawse mek tracks The whip cracked and the startled horse went off at a wild gallop that threatened to throw the buggy into the ditch Ah hope Ah done kill dat black baboon But Ah din wait ter fine out he panted But ef he hahmed you Miss Scarlett Ahll go back an mek sho of it Nonodrive on quickly she sobbed CHAPTER XLV THAT NIGHT when Frank deposited her and Aunt Pitty and the children at Melanies and rode off down the street with Ashley Scarlett could have burst with rage and hurt How could he go off to a political meeting on this of all nights in the world A political meeting And on the same night when she had been attacked when anything might have happened to her It was unfeeling and selfish of him But then he had taken the whole affair with maddening calm ever since Sam had carried her sobbing into the house her basque gaping to the waist He hadnt clawed his beard even once when she cried out her story He had just questioned gently Sugar are you hurtor just scared Wrath mingling with her tears she had been unable to answer and Sam had volunteered that she was just scared Ah got dar fo dey done mon tar her dress Youre a good boy Sam and I wont forget what youve done If theres anything I can do for you Yassah you kin sen me ter Tara quick as you kin De Yankees is affer me Frank had listened to this statement calmly too and had asked no questions He had looked very much as he did the night Tony came beating on their door as though this was an exclusively masculine affair and one to be handled with a minimum of words and emotions You go get in the buggy Ill have Peter drive you as far as Rough and Ready tonight and you can hide in the woods till morning and then catch the train to Jonesboro Itll be safer  Now Sugar stop crying Its all over now and you arent really hurt Miss Pitty could I have your smelling salts And Mammy fetch Miss Scarlett a glass of wine Scarlett had burst into renewed tears this time tears of rage She wanted comforting indignation threats of vengeance She would even have preferred him storming at her saying that this was just what he had warned her would happenanything rather than have him take it all so casually and treat her danger as a matter of small moment He was nice and gentle of course but in an absent way as if he had something far more important on his mind And that important thing had turned out to be a small political meeting She could hardly believe her ears when he told her to change her dress and get ready for him to escort her over to Melanies for the evening He must know how harrowing her experience had been must know she did not want to spend an evening at Melanies when her tired body and jangled nerves cried out for the warm relaxation of bed and blanketswith a hot brick to make her toes tingle and a hot toddy to soothe her fears If he really loved her nothing could have forced him from her side on this of all nights He would have stayed home and held her hand and told her over and over that he would have died if anything had happened to her And when he came home tonight and she had him alone she would certainly tell him so Melanies small parlor looked as serene as it usually did on nights when Frank and Ashley were away and the women gathered together to sew The room was warm and cheerful in the firelight The lamp on the table shed a quiet yellow glow on the four smooth heads bent to their needlework Four skirts billowed modestly eight small feet were daintily placed on low hassocks The quiet breathing of Wade Ella and Beau came through the open door of the nursery Archie sat on a stool by the hearth his back against the fireplace his cheek distended with tobacco whittling industriously on a bit of wood The contrast between the dirty hairy old man and the four neat fastidious ladies was as great as though he were a grizzled vicious old watchdog and they four small kittens Melanies soft voice tinged with indignation went on and on as she told of the recent outburst of temperament on the part of the Lady Harpists Unable to agree with the Gentlemens Glee Club as to the program for their next recital the ladies had waited on Melanie that afternoon and announced their intention of withdrawing completely from the Musical Circle It had taken all of  Page    Gone With The Wind Melanies diplomacy to persuade them to defer their decision Scarlett overwrought could have screamed Oh damn the Lady Harpists She wanted to talk about her dreadful experience She was bursting to relate it in detail so she could ease her own fright by frightening the others She wanted to tell how brave she had been just to assure herself by the sound of her own words that she had indeed been brave But every time she brought up the subject Melanie deftly steered the conversation into other and innocuous channels This irritated Scarlett almost beyond endurance They were as mean as Frank How could they be so calm and placid when she had just escaped so terrible a fate They werent even displaying common courtesy in denying her the relief of talking about it The events of the afternoon had shaken her more than she cared to admit even to herself Every time she thought of that malignant black face peering at her from the shadows of the twilight forest road she fell to trembling When she thought of the black hand at her bosom and what would have happened if Big Sam had not appeared she bent her head lower and squeezed her eyes tightly shut The longer she sat silent in the peaceful room trying to sew listening to Melanies voice the tighter her nerves stretched She felt that at any moment she would actually hear them break with the same pinging sound a banjo string makes when it snaps Archies whittling annoyed her and she frowned at him Suddenly it seemed odd that he should be sitting there occupying himself with a piece of wood Usually he lay flat on the sofa during the evenings when he was on guard and slept and snored so violently that his long beard leaped into the air with each rumbling breath It was odder still that neither Melanie nor India hinted to him that he should spread a paper on the floor to catch his litter of shavings He had already made a perfect mess on the hearth rug but they did not seem to have noticed it While she watched him Archie turned suddenly toward the fire and spat a stream of tobacco juice on it with such vehemence that India Melanie and Pitty leaped as though a bomb had exploded  Need you expectorate so loudly cried India in a voice that cracked with nervous annoyance Scarlett looked at her in surprise for India was always so selfcontained Archie gave her look for look I reckon I do he answered coldly and spat again Melanie gave a little frowning glance at India I was always so glad dear Papa didnt chew began Pitty and Melanie her frown creasing deeper swung on her and spoke sharper words than Scarlett had ever heard her speak Oh do hush Auntie Youre so tactless Oh dear Pitty dropped her sewing in her lap and her mouth pressed up in hurt I declare I dont know What ails you all tonight You and India are just as jumpy and cross as two old sticks No one answered her Melanie did not even apologize for her crossness but went back to her sewing with small violence Youre taking stitches an inch long declared Pitty with some satisfaction Youll have to take every one of them out Whats the matter with you But Melanie still did not answer Was there anything the matter with them Scarlett wondered Had she been too absorbed with her own fears to notice Yes despite Melanies attempts to make the evening appear like any one of fifty they had all spent together there was a difference due to their alarm and shock at what had happened that afternoon Scarlett stole glances at her companions and intercepted a look from India It discomforted her because it was a long measuring glance that carried in its cold depths something stronger than hate something more insulting than contempt As though she thought I was to blame for what happened Scarlett thought indignantly India turned from her to Archie and all annoyance at him gone from her face gave him a look of veiled anxious inquiry But he did not meet her eyes He did however look at Scarlett staring at her in the same cold hard way India had done Silence fell dully in the room as Melanie did not take up the conversation again and in the silence Scarlett heard the rising wind outside It suddenly began to be a most unpleasant evening Now she began to feel the tension in the air and she wondered if it had been present all during the eveningand she too upset to notice it About Archies face there was an alert waiting look and his tufted hairy old ears seemed pricked up like a lynxs There was a severely repressed uneasiness about Melanie and India that made them raise their heads from their sewing at each sound of hooves in the road at each groan of bare branches under the wailing wind at each scuffing sound of dry leaves tumbling across the lawn They started at each soft snap of burning logs on the hearth as if they were stealthy footsteps Something was wrong and Scarlett wondered what it was Something was afoot and she did not know about it A glance at Aunt Pittys plump guileless face screwed up in a pout told her that the old lady was as ignorant as she But Archie and Melanie and India knew In the silence she could almost feel the thoughts of India and Melanie whirling as madly as squirrels in a cage They knew something were waiting for something despite their efforts to make things appear as usual And their inner unease communicated itself to Scarlett making her more nervous than before Handling her needle awkwardly she jabbed it into her thumb and with a little scream of pain and annoyance that made them all jump she squeezed it until a bright red drop appeared Im just too nervous to sew she declared throwing her mending to the floor Im nervous enough to scream I want to go home and go to bed And Frank knew it and he oughtnt to have gone out He talks talks talks about protecting women against darkies and Carpetbaggers and when the time comes for him to do some protecting where is he At home taking care of me No indeed hes gallivanting around with a lot of other men who dont do anything but talk and Her snapping eyes came to rest on Indias face and she paused India was breathing fast and her pale lashless eyes were fastened on Scarletts face with a deadly coldness If it wont pain you too much India she broke off sarcastically Id be much obliged if youd tell me why youve been staring at me all evening Has my face turned green or something It wont pain me to tell you Ill do it with pleasure said India and her eyes glittered I hate to see you underrate a fine man like Mr Kennedy when if you knew  Page    Gone With The Wind India said Melanie warningly her hands clenching on her sewing I think I know my husband better than you do said Scarlett the prospect of a quarrel the first open quarrel she had ever had with India making her spirits rise and her nervousness depart Melanies eyes caught Indias and reluctantly India closed her lips But almost instantly she spoke again and her voice was cold with hate You make me sick Scarlett OHara talking about being protected You dont care about being protected If you did youd never have exposed yourself as you have done all these months prissing yourself about this town showing yourself off to strange men hoping theyll admire you What happened to you this afternoon was just what you deserved and if there was any justice youd have gotten worse Oh India hush cried Melanie Let her talk cried Scarlett Im enjoying it I always knew she hated me and she was too much of a hypocrite to admit it If she thought anyone would admire her shed be walking the streets naked from dawn till dark India was on her feet her lean body quivering with insult I do hate you she said in a clear but trembling voice But it hasnt been hypocrisy thats kept me quiet Its something you cant understand not possessing anyany common courtesy common good breeding Its the realization that if all of us dont hang together and submerge our own small hates we cant expect to beat the Yankees But youyouyouve done all you could to lower the prestige of decent peopleworking and bringing shame on a good husband giving Yankees and riffraff the right to laugh at us and make insulting remarks about our lack of gentility Yankees dont know that you arent one of us and have never been Yankees havent sense enough to know that you havent any gentility And when youve ridden about the woods exposing yourself to attack youve exposed every wellbehaved woman in town to attack by putting temptation in the ways of darkies and mean white trash And youve put our men folks lives in danger because theyve got to My God India cried Melanie and even in her wrath Scarlett was stunned to hear Melanie take the Lords name in vain You must hush She doesnt know and sheyou must hush You promised Oh girls pleaded Miss Pittypat her lips trembling What dont I know Scarlett was on her feet furious facing the coldly blazing India and the imploring Melanie Guinea hens said Archie suddenly and his voice was contemptuous Before anyone could rebuke him his grizzled head went up sharply and he rose swiftly Somebody comin up the walk Taint Mr Wilkes neither Cease your cackle There was male authority in his voice and the women stood suddenly silent anger fading swiftly from their faces as he stumped across the room to the door Whos thar he questioned before the caller even knocked Captain Butler Let me in Melanie was across the floor so swiftly that her hoops swayed up violently revealing her pantalets to the knees and before Archie could put his hand on the knob she flung the door open Rhett Butler stood in the doorway his black slouch hat low over his eyes the wild wind whipping his cape about him in snapping folds For once his good manners had deserted him He neither took off his hat nor spoke to the others in the room He had eyes for no one but Melanie and he spoke abruptly without greeting Where have they gone Tell me quickly Its life or death Scarlett and Pitty startled and bewildered looked at each other in wonderment and like a lean old cat India streaked across the room to Melanies side Dont tell him anything she cried swiftly Hes a spy a Scalawag Rhett did not even favor her with a glance Quickly Mrs Wilkes There may still be time Melanie seemed in a paralysis of terror and only stared into his face What on earth began Scarlett Shet yore mouth directed Archie briefly You too Miss Melly Git the hell out of here you damned Scalawag No Archie no cried Melanie and she put a shaking hand on Rhetts arm as though to protect him from Archie What has happened How didhow did you know On Rhetts dark face impatience fought with courtesy Good God Mrs Wilkes theyve all been under suspicion since the beginningonly theyve been too cleveruntil tonight How do I know I was playing poker tonight with two drunken Yankee captains and they let it out The Yankees knew thered be trouble tonight and theyve prepared for it The fools have walked into a trap For a moment it was as though Melanie swayed under the impact of a heavy blow and Rhetts arm went around her waist to steady her Dont tell him Hes trying to trap you cried India glaring at Rhett Didnt you hear him say hed been with Yankee officers tonight Still Rhett did not look at her His eyes were bent insistently on Melanies white face Tell me Where did they go Have they a meeting place Despite her fear and incomprehension Scarlett thought she had never seen a blanker more expressionless face than Rhetts but evidently Melanie saw something else something that made her give her trust She straightened her small body away from the steadying arm and said quietly but with a voice that shook Out the Decatur road near Shantytown They meet in the cellar of the old Sullivan plantationthe one thats halfburned Thank you Ill ride fast When the Yankees come here none of you know anything He was gone so swiftly his black cape melting into the night that they could hardly realize he had been there at all until they heard the spattering of gravel and the mad pounding of a horse going off at full gallop The Yankees coming here cried Pitty and her small feet turning under her she collapsed on the sofa too frightened for tears Whats it all about What did he mean If you dont tell me Ill go crazy Scarlett laid hands on Melanie and shook her  Page    Gone With The Wind violently as if by force she could shake an answer from her Mean It means youve probably been the cause of Ashleys and Mr Kennedys death In spite of the agony of fear there was a note of triumph in Indias voice Stop shaking Melly Shes going to faint No Im not whispered Melanie clutching the back of a chair My God my God I dont understand Kill Ashley Please somebody tell me Archies voice like a rusty hinge cut through Scarletts words Set down he ordered briefly Pick up yore sewin Sew like nothin had happened For all we know the Yankees might have been spyin on this house since sundown Set down I say and sew Trembling they obeyed even Pitty picking up a sock and holding it in shaking fingers while her eyes wide as a frightened childs went around the circle for an explanation Where is Ashley What has happened to him Melly cried Scarlett Wheres your husband Arent you interested in him Indias pale eyes blazed with insane malice as she crumpled and straightened the torn towel she had been mending India please Melanie had mastered her voice but her white shaken face and tortured eyes showed the strain under which she was laboring Scarlett perhaps we should have told you butbutyou had been through so much this afternoon that wethat Frank didnt thinkand you were always so outspoken against the Klan The Klan At first Scarlett spoke the word as if she had never heard it before and had no comprehension of its meaning and then The Klan she almost screamed it Ashley isnt in the Klan Frank cant be Oh he promised me Of course Mr Kennedy is in the Klan and Ashley too and all the men we know cried India They are men arent they And white men and Southerners You should have been proud of him instead of making him sneak out as though it were something shameful and You all have known all along and I didnt We were afraid it would upset you said Melanie sorrowfully Then thats where they go when theyre supposed to be at the political meetings Oh he promised me Now the Yankees will come and take my mills and the store and put him in jailoh what did Rhett Butler mean Indias eyes met Melanies in wild fear Scarlett rose flinging her sewing down If you dont tell me Im going downtown and find out Ill ask everybody I see until I find Set said Archie fixing her with his eye Ill tell you Because you went gallivantin this afternoon and got yoreself into trouble through yore own fault Mr Wilkes and Mr Kennedy and the other men are out tonight to kill that thar nigger and that thar white man if they can catch them and wipe out that whole Shantytown settlement And if what that Scalawag said is true the Yankees suspected sumpin or got wind somehow and theyve sont out troops to lay for them And our men have walked into a trap And if what Butler said warnt true then hes a spy and he is goin to turn them up to the Yankees and theyll git kilt just the same And if he does turn them up then Ill kill him if its the last deed of m life And if they aint kilt then theyll all have to light out of here for Texas and lay low and maybe never come back Its all yore fault and thars blood on yore hands Anger wiped out the fear from Melanies face as she saw comprehension come slowly across Scarletts face and then horror follow swiftly She rose and put her hand on Scarletts shoulder Another such word and you go out of this house Archie she said sternly Its not her fault She only diddid what she felt she had to do And our men did what they felt they had to do People must do what they must do We dont all think alike or act alike and its wrong toto judge others by ourselves How can you and India say such cruel things when her husband as well as mine may bemay be Hark interrupted Archie softly Set Mam Thars horses Melanie sank into a chair picked up one of Ashleys shirts and bowing her head over it unconsciously began to tear the frills into small ribbons The sound of hooves grew louder as horses trotted up to the house There was the jangling of bits and the strain of leather and the sound of voices As the hooves stopped in front of the house one voice rose above the others in a command and the listeners heard feet going through the side yard toward the back porch They felt that a thousand inimical eyes looked at them through the unshaded front window and the four women with fear in their hearts bent their heads and plied their needles Scarletts heart screamed in her breast Ive killed Ashley Ive killed him And in that wild moment she did not even think that she might have killed Frank too She had no room in her mind for any picture save that of Ashley lying at the feet of Yankee cavalrymen his fair hair dappled with blood As the harsh rapid knocking sounded at the door she looked at Melanie and saw come over the small strained face a new expression an expression as blank as she had just seen on Rhett Butlers face the bland blank look of a poker player bluffing a game with only two deuces Archie open the door she said quietly Slipping his knife into his boot top and loosening the pistol in his trouser band Archie stumped over to the door and flung it open Pitty gave a little squeak like a mouse who feels the trap snap down as she saw massed in the doorway a Yankee captain and a squad of bluecoats But the others said nothing Scarlett saw with the faintest feeling of relief that she knew this officer He was Captain Tom Jaffery one of Rhetts friends She had sold him lumber to build his house She knew him to be a gentleman Perhaps as he was a gentleman he wouldnt drag them away to prison He recognized her instantly and taking off his hat bowed somewhat embarrassed Good evening Mrs Kennedy And which of you ladies is Mrs Wilkes I am Mrs Wilkes answered Melanie rising and for all her smallness dignity flowed from her And to what do I owe this intrusion The eyes of the captain flickered quickly about the room resting for an instant on each face passing quickly from their faces to  Page    Gone With The Wind the table and the hat rack as though looking for signs of male occupancy I should like to speak to Mr Wilkes and Mr Kennedy if you please They are not here said Melanie a chill in her soft voice Are you sure Dont you question Miz Wilkes word said Archie his beard bristling I beg your pardon Mrs Wilkes I meant no disrespect If you give me your word I will not search the house You have my word But search if you like They are at a meeting downtown at Mr Kennedys store They are not at the store There was no meeting tonight answered the captain grimly We will wait outside until they return He bowed briefly and went out closing the door behind him Those in the house heard a sharp order muffled by the wind Surround the house A man at each window and door There was a tramping of feet Scarlett checked a start of terror as she dimly saw bearded faces peering in the windows at them Melanie sat down and with a hand that did not tremble reached for a book on the table It was a ragged copy of Les Miserables that book which caught the fancy of the Confederate soldiers They had read it by campfire light and took some grim pleasure in calling it Lees Miserables She opened it at the middle and began to read in a clear monotonous voice Sew commanded Archie in a hoarse whisper and the three women nerved by Melanies cool voice picked up their sewing and bowed their heads How long Melanie read beneath that circle of watching eyes Scarlett never knew but it seemed hours She did not even hear a word that Melanie read Now she was beginning to think of Frank as well as Ashley So this was the explanation of his apparent calm this evening He had promised her he would have nothing to do with the Klan Oh this was just the kind of trouble she had feared would come upon them All the work of this last year would go for nothing All her struggles and fears and labors in rain and cold had been wasted And who would have thought that spiritless old Frank would get himself mixed up in the hotheaded doings of the Klan Even at this minute he might be dead And if he wasnt dead and the Yankees caught him hed be hanged And Ashley too Her nails dug into her palms until four brightred crescents showed How could Melanie read on and on so calmly when Ashley was in danger of being hanged When he might be dead But something in the cool soft voice reading the sorrows of Jean Valjean steadied her kept her from leaping to her feet and screaming Her mind fled back to the night Tony Fontaine had come to them hunted exhausted without money If he had not reached their house and received money and a fresh horse he would have been hanged long since If Frank and Ashley were not dead at this very minute they were in Tonys position only worse With the house surrounded by soldiers they couldnt come home and get money and clothes without being captured And probably every house up and down the street had a similar guard of Yankees so they could not apply to friends for aid Even now they might be riding wildly through the night bound for Texas But Rhettperhaps Rhett had reached them in time Rhett always had plenty of cash in his pocket Perhaps he would lend them enough to see them through But that was queer Why should Rhett bother himself about Ashleys safety Certainly he disliked him certainly he professed a contempt for him Then why But his riddle was swallowed up in a renewed fear for the safety of Ashley and Frank Oh its all my fault she wailed to herself India and Archie spoke the truth Its all my fault But I never thought either of them was foolish enough to join the Klan And I never thought anything would really happen to me But I couldnt have done otherwise Melly spoke the truth People have to do what they have to do And I had to keep the mills going I had to have money And now Ill probably lose it all and somehow its all my fault After a long time Melanies voice faltered trailed off and was silent She turned her head toward the window and stared as though no Yankee soldier stared back from behind the glass The others raised their heads caught by her listening pose and they too listened There was a sound of horses feet and of singing deadened by the closed windows and doors borne away by the wind but still recognizable It was the most hated and hateful of all songs the song about Shermans men Marching through Georgia and Rhett Butler was singing it Hardly had he finished the first lines when two other voices drunken voices assailed him enraged foolish voices that stumbled over words and blurred them together There was a quick command from Captain Jaffery on the front porch and the rapid tramp of feet But even before these sounds arose the ladies looked at one another stunned For the drunken voices expostulating with Rhett were those of Ashley and Hugh Elsing Voices rose louder on the front walk Captain Jafferys curt and questioning Hughs shrill with foolish laughter Rhetts deep and reckless and Ashleys queer unreal shouting What the hell What the hell That cant be Ashley thought Scarlett wildly He never gets drunk And Rhettwhy when Rhetts drunk he gets quieter and quieternever loud like that Melanie rose and with her Archie rose They heard the captains sharp voice These two men are under arrest And Archies hand closed over his pistol butt No whispered Melanie firmly No Leave it to me There was in her face the same look Scarlett had seen that day at Tara when Melanie had stood at the top of the steps looking down at the dead Yankee her weak wrist weighed down by the heavy sabera gentle and timid soul nerved by circumstances to the caution and fury of a tigress She threw the front door open Bring him in Captain Butler she called in a clear tone that bit with venom I suppose youve gotten him intoxicated again Bring him in From the dark windy walk the Yankee captain spoke Im sorry Mrs Wilkes but your husband and Mr Elsing are under arrest Arrest For what For drunkenness If everyone in Atlanta was arrested for drunkenness the whole Yankee garrison would  Page    Gone With The Wind be in jail continually Well bring him in Captain Butlerthat is if you can walk yourself Scarletts mind was not working quickly and for a brief moment nothing made sense She knew neither Rhett nor Ashley was drunk and she knew Melanie knew they were not drunk Yet here was Melanie usually so gentle and refined screaming like a shrew and in front of Yankees too that both of them were too drunk to walk There was a short mumbled argument punctuated with curses and uncertain feet ascended the stairs In the doorway appeared Ashley white faced his head lolling his bright hair tousled his long body wrapped from neck to knees in Rhetts black cape Hugh Elsing and Rhett none too steady on their feet supported him on either side and it was obvious he would have fallen to the floor but for their aid Behind them came the Yankee captain his face a study of mingled suspicion and amusement He stood in the open doorway with his men peering curiously over his shoulders and the cold wind swept the house Scarlett frightened puzzled glanced at Melanie and back to the sagging Ashley and then halfcomprehension came to her She started to cry out But he cant be drunk and bit back the words She realized she was witnessing a play a desperate play on which lives hinged She knew she was not part of it nor was Aunt Pitty but the others were and they were tossing cues to one another like actors in an oftrehearsed drama She understood only half but she understood enough to keep silent Put him in the chair cried Melanie indignantly And you Captain Butler leave this house immediately How dare you show your face here after getting him in this condition again The two men eased Ashley into a rocker and Rhett swaying caught hold of the back of the chair to steady himself and addressed the captain with pain in his voice Thats fine thanks I get isnt it For keeping the police from getting him and bringing him home and him yelling and trying to claw me And you Hugh Elsing Im ashamed of you What will your poor mother say Drunk and out with aa Yankeeloving Scalawag like Captain Butler And oh Mr Wilkes how could you do such a thing Melly I aint so very drunk mumbled Ashley and with the words fell forward and lay face down on the table his head buried in his arms Archie take him to his room and put him to bedas usual ordered Melanie Aunt Pitty please run and fix the bed and oooh she suddenly burst into tears Oh how could he After he promised Archie already had his arm under Ashleys shoulder and Pitty frightened and uncertain was on her feet when the captain interposed Dont touch him Hes under arrest Sergeant As the sergeant stepped into the room his rifle at trail Rhett evidently trying to steady himself put a hand on the captains arm and with difficulty focused his eyes Tom what you arresting him for He aint so very drunk Ive seen him drunker Drunk be damned cried the captain He can lie in the gutter for all I care Im no policeman He and Mr Elsing are under arrest for complicity in a Klan raid at Shantytown tonight A nigger and a white man were killed Mr Wilkes was the ringleader in it Tonight Rhett began to laugh He laughed so hard that he sat down on the sofa and put his head in his hands Not tonight Tom he said when he could speak These two have been with me tonightever since eight oclock when they were supposed to be at the meeting With you Rhett But A frown came over the captains forehead and he looked uncertainly at the snoring Ashley and his weeping wife Butwhere were you I dont like to say and Rhett shot a look of drunken cunning at Melanie Youd better say Les go out on the porch and Ill tell you where we were Youll tell me now Hate to say it in front of ladies If you ladiesll step out of the room I wont go cried Melanie dabbing angrily at her eyes with her handkerchief I have a right to know Where was my husband At Belle Watlings sporting house said Rhett looking abashed He was there and Hugh and Frank Kennedy and Dr Meade andand a whole lot of them Had a party Big party Champagne Girls Atat Belle Watlings Melanies voice rose until it cracked with such pain that all eyes turned frightenedly to her Her hand went clutching at her bosom and before Archie could catch her she had fainted Then a hubbub ensued Archie picking her up India running to the kitchen for water Pitty and Scarlett fanning her and slapping her wrists while Hugh Elsing shouted over and over Now youve done it Now youve done it Now itll be all over town said Rhett savagely I hope youre satisfied Tom There wont be a wife in Atlanta wholl speak to her husband tomorrow Rhett I had no idea Though the chill wind was blowing through the open door on his back the captain was perspiring Look here You take an oath they were aterat Belles Hell yes growled Rhett Go ask Belle herself if you dont believe me Now let me carry Mrs Wilkes to her room Give her to me Archie Yes I can carry her Miss Pitty go ahead with a lamp He took Melanies limp body from Archies arms with ease You get Mr Wilkes to bed Archie I dont want to ever lay eyes or hands on him again after this night Pittys hand trembled so that the lamp was a menace to the safety of the house but she held it and trotted ahead toward the dark bedroom Archie with a grunt got an arm under Ashley and raised him ButIve got to arrest these men Rhett turned in the dim hallway  Page    Gone With The Wind Arrest them in the morning then They cant run away in this conditionand I never knew before that it was illegal to get drunk in a sporting house Good God Tom there are fifty witnesses to prove they were at Belles There are always fifty witnesses to prove a Southerner was somewhere he wasnt said the captain morosely You come with me Mr Elsing Ill parole Mr Wilkes on the word of I am Mr Wilkes sister I will answer for his appearance said India coldly Now will you please go Youve caused enough trouble for one night I regret it exceedingly The captain bowed awkwardly I only hope they can prove their presence at theerMissMrs Watlings house Will you tell your brother that he must appear before the provost marshal tomorrow morning for questioning India bowed coldly and putting her hand upon the door knob intimated silently that his speedy retirement would be welcome The captain and the sergeant backed out Hugh Elsing with them and she slammed the door behind them Without even looking at Scarlett she went swiftly to each window and drew down the shade Scarlett her knees shaking caught hold of the chair in which Ashley had been sitting to steady herself Looking down at it she saw that there was a dark moist spot larger than her hand on the cushion in the back of the chair Puzzled her hand went over it and to her horror a sticky red wetness appeared on her palm India she whispered India Ashleyshes hurt You fool Did you think he was really drunk India snapped down the last shade and started on flying feet for the bedroom with Scarlett close behind her her heart in her throat Rhetts big body barred the doorway but past his shoulder Scarlett saw Ashley lying white and still on the bed Melanie strangely quick for one so recently in a faint was rapidly cutting off his bloodsoaked shirt with embroidery scissors Archie held the lamp low over the bed to give light and one of his gnarled fingers was on Ashleys wrist Is he dead cried both girls together No just fainted from loss of blood Its through his shoulder said Rhett Why did you bring him here you fool cried India Let me get to him Let me pass Why did you bring him here to be arrested He was too weak to travel There was nowhere else to bring him Miss Wilkes Besidesdo you want him to be an exile like Tony Fontaine Do you want a dozen of your neighbors to live in Texas under assumed names for the rest of their lives Theres a chance that we may get them all off if Belle Let me pass No Miss Wilkes Theres work for you You must go for a doctor Not Dr Meade Hes implicated in this and is probably explaining to the Yankees at this very minute Get some other doctor Are you afraid to go out alone at night No said India her pale eyes glittering Im not afraid She caught up Melanies hooded cape which was hanging on a book in the hall Ill go for old Dr Dean The excitement went out of her voice as with an effort she forced calmness Im sorry I called you a spy and a fool I did not understand Im deeply grateful for what youve done for Ashleybut I despise you just the same I appreciate franknessand I thank you for it Rhett bowed and his lip curled down in an amused smile Now go quickly and by back ways and when you return do not come in this house if you see signs of soldiers about India shot one more quick anguished look at Ashley and wrapping her cape about her ran lightly down the hall to the back door and let herself out quietly into the night Scarlett straining her eyes past Rhett felt her heart beat again as she saw Ashleys eyes open Melanie snatched a folded towel from the washstand rack and pressed it against his streaming shoulder and he smiled up weakly reassuringly into her face Scarlett felt Rhetts hard penetrating eyes upon her knew that her heart was plain upon her face but she did not care Ashley was bleeding perhaps dying and she who loved him had torn that hole through his shoulder She wanted to run to the bed sink down beside it and clasp him to her but her knees trembled so that she could not enter the room Hand at her mouth she stared while Melanie packed a fresh towel against his shoulder pressing it hard as though she could force back the blood into his body But the towel reddened as though by magic How could a man bleed so much and still live But thank God there was no bubble of blood at his lipsoh those frothy red bubbles forerunners of death that she knew so well from the dreadful day of the battle at Peachtree Creek when the wounded had died on Aunt Pittys lawn with bloody mouths Brace up said Rhett and there was a hard faintly jeering note in his voice He wont die Now go take the lamp and hold it for Mrs Wilkes I need Archie to run errands Archie looked across the lamp at Rhett I aint takin no orders from you he said briefly shifting his wad of tobacco to the other cheek You do what he says said Melanie sternly and do it quickly Do everything Captain Butler says Scarlett take the lamp Scarlett went forward and took the lamp holding it in both hands to keep from dropping it Ashleys eyes had closed again His bare chest heaved up slowly and sank quickly and the red stream seeped from between Melanies small frantic fingers Dimly she heard Archie stump across the room to Rhett and heard Rhetts low rapid words Her mind was so fixed upon Ashley that of the first halfwhispered words of Rhett she only heard Take my horse  tied outside  ride like hell Archie mumbled some question and Scarlett heard Rhett reply The old Sullivan plantation Youll find the robes pushed up the biggest chimney Burn them Um grunted Archie And theres twomen in the cellar Pack them over the horse as best you can and take them to that vacant lot behind Bellesthe one between her house and the railroad tracks Be careful If anyone sees you youll hang as well as the rest of us Put them in that lot and put pistols near themin their hands Heretake mine Scarlett looking across the room saw Rhett reach under his coat tails and produce two revolvers which Archie took and shoved into his waist band  Page    Gone With The Wind Fire one shot from each Its got to appear like a plain case of shooting You understand Archie nodded as if he understood perfectly and an unwilling gleam of respect shone in his cold eye But understanding was far from Scarlett The last halfhour had been so nightmarish that she felt nothing would ever be plain and clear again However Rhett seemed in perfect command of the bewildering situation and that was a small comfort Archie turned to go and then swung about and his one eye went questioningly to Rhetts face Him Yes Archie grunted and spat on the floor Hell to pay he said as he stumped down the hall to the back door Something in the last low interchange of words made a new fear and suspicion rise up in Scarletts breast like a chill everswelling bubble When that bubble broke Wheres Frank she cried Rhett came swiftly across the room to the bed his big body swinging as lightly and noiselessly as a cats All in good time he said and smiled briefly Steady that lamp Scarlett You dont want to burn Mr Wilkes up Miss Melly Melanie looked up like a good little soldier awaiting a command and so tense was the situation it did not occur to her that for the first time Rhett was calling her familiarly by the name which only family and old friends used I beg your pardon I mean Mrs Wilkes  Oh Captain Butler do not ask my pardon I should feel honored if you called me Melly without the Miss I feel as though you were mymy brother oror my cousin How kind you are and how clever How can I ever thank you enough Thank you said Rhett and for a moment he looked almost embarrassed I should never presume so far but Miss Melly and his voice was apologetic Im sorry I had to say that Mr Wilkes was in Belle Watlings house Im sorry to have involved him and the others in such a But I had to think fast when I rode away from here and that was the only plan that occurred to me I knew my word would be accepted because I have so many friends among the Yankee officers They do me the dubious honor of thinking me almost one of them because they know myshall we call it my unpopularityamong my townsmen And you see I was playing poker in Belles bar earlier in the evening There are a dozen Yankee soldiers who can testify to that And Belle and her girls will gladly lie themselves black in the face and say Mr Wilkes and the others wereupstairs all evening And the Yankees will believe them Yankees are queer that way It wont occur to them that women oftheir profession are capable of intense loyalty or patriotism The Yankees wouldnt take the word of a single nice Atlanta lady as to the whereabouts of the men who were supposed to be at the meeting tonight but they will take the word offancy ladies And I think that between the word of honor of a Scalawag and a dozen fancy ladies we may have a chance of getting the men off There was a sardonic grin on his face at the last words but it faded as Melanie turned up to him a face that blazed with gratitude Captain Butler you are so smart I wouldnt have cared if youd said they were in hell itself tonight if it saves them For I know and every one else who matters knows that my husband was never in a dreadful place like that Well began Rhett awkwardly as a matter of fact he was at Belles tonight Melanie drew herself up coldly You can never make me believe such a lie Please Miss Melly Let me explain When I got out to the old Sullivan place tonight I found Mr Wilkes wounded and with him were Hugh Elsing and Dr Meade and old man Merriwether Not the old gentleman cried Scarlett Men are never too old to be fools And your Uncle Henry Oh mercy cried Aunt Pitty The others had scattered after the brush with the troops and the crowd that stuck together had come to the Sullivan place to hide their robes in the chimney and to see how badly Mr Wilkes was hurt But for his wound theyd be headed for Texas by nowall of thembut he couldnt ride far and they wouldnt leave him It was necessary to prove that they had been somewhere instead of where they had been and so I took them by back ways to Belle Watlings OhI see I do beg your pardon for my rudeness Captain Butler I see now it was necessary to take them there but Oh Captain Butler people must have seen you going in No one saw us We went in through a private back entrance that opens on the railroad tracks Its always dark and locked Then how I have a key said Rhett laconically and his eyes met Melanies evenly As the full impact of the meaning smote her Melanie became so embarrassed that she fumbled with the bandage until it slid off the wound entirely I did not mean to pry she said in a muffled voice her white face reddening as she hastily pressed the towel back into place I regret having to tell a lady such a thing Then its true thought Scarlett with an odd pang Then he does live with that dreadful Watling creature He does own her house I saw Belle and explained to her We gave her a list of the men who were out tonight and she and her girls will testify that they were all in her house tonight Then to make our exit more conspicuous she called the two desperadoes who keep order at her place and had us dragged downstairs fighting and through the barroom and thrown out into the street as brawling drunks who were disturbing the place He grinned reminiscently Dr Meade did not make a very convincing drunk It hurt his dignity to even be in such a place But your Uncle Henry and old man Merriwether were excellent The stage lost two great actors when they did not take up the drama They seemed to enjoy the affair Im afraid your Uncle Henry has a black eye due to Mr Merriwethers zeal for his part He The back door swung open and India entered followed by old Dr Dean his long white hair tumbled his worn leather bag  Page    Gone With The Wind bulging under his cape He nodded briefly but without words to those present and quickly lifted the bandage from Ashleys shoulder Too high for the lung he said If it hasnt splintered his collar bone its not so serious Get me plenty of towels ladies and cotton if you have it and some brandy Rhett took the lamp from Scarlett and set it on the table as Melanie and India sped about obeying the doctors orders You cant do anything here Come into the parlor by the fire He took her arm and propelled her from the room There was a gentleness foreign to him in both hand and voice Youve had a rotten day havent you She allowed herself to be led into the front room and though she stood on the hearth rug in front of the fire she began to shiver The bubble of suspicion in her breast was swelling larger now It was more than a suspicion It was almost a certainty and a terrible certainty She looked up into Rhetts immobile face and for a moment she could not speak Then Was Frank atBelle Watlings No Rhetts voice was blunt Archies carrying him to the vacant lot near Belles Hes dead Shot through the head CHAPTER XLVI FEW FAMILIES in the north end of town slept that night for the news of the disaster to the Klan and Rhetts stratagem spread swiftly on silent feet as the shadowy form of India Wilkes slipped through back yards whispered urgently through kitchen doors and slipped away into the windy darkness And in her path she left fear and desperate hope From without houses looked black and silent and wrapped in sleep but within voices whispered vehemently into the dawn Not only those involved in the nights raid but every member of the Klan was ready for flight and in almost every stable along Peachtree Street horses stood saddled in the darkness pistols in holsters and food in saddlebags All that prevented a wholesale exodus was Indias whispered message Captain Butler says not to run The roads will be watched He has arranged with that Watling creature In dark rooms men whispered But why should I trust that damned Scalawag Butler It may be a trap And womens voices implored Dont go If he saved Ashley and Hugh he may save everybody If India and Melanie trust him And they half trusted and stayed because there was no other course open to them Earlier in the night the soldiers had knocked at a dozen doors and those who could not or would not tell where they had been that night were marched off under arrest Ren Picard and one of Mrs Merriwethers nephews and the Simmons boys and Andy Bonnell were among those who spent the night in jail They had been in the illstarred foray but had separated from the others after the shooting Riding hard for home they were arrested before they learned of Rhetts plan Fortunately they all replied to questions that where they had been that night was their own business and not that of any damned Yankees They had been locked up for further questioning in the morning Old man Merriwether and Uncle Henry Hamilton declared shamelessly that they had spent the evening at Belle Watlings sporting house and when Captain Jaffery remarked irritably that they were too old for such goings on they wanted to fight him Belle Watling herself answered Captain Jafferys summons and before he could make known his mission she shouted that the house was closed for the night A passel of quarrelsome drunks had called in the early part of the evening and had fought one another torn the place up broken her finest mirrors and so alarmed the young ladies that all business had been suspended for the night But if Captain Jaffery wanted a drink the bar was still open Captain Jaffery acutely conscious of the grins of his men and feeling helplessly that he was fighting a mist declared angrily that he wanted neither the young ladies nor a drink and demanded if Belle knew the names of her destructive customers Oh yes Belle knew them They were her regulars They came every Wednesday night and called themselves the Wednesday Democrats though what they meant by that she neither knew or cared And if they didnt pay for the damage to the mirrors in the upper hall she was going to have the law on them She kept a respectable house and Oh their names Belle unhesitatingly reeled off the names of twelve under suspicion Captain Jaffery smiled sourly These damned Rebels are as efficiently organized as our Secret Service he said You and your girls will have to appear before the provost marshal tomorrow Will the provost make them pay for my mirrors To hell with your mirrors Make Rhett Butler pay for them He owns the place doesnt he  Before dawn every exConfederate family in town knew everything And their negroes who had been told nothing knew everything too by that black grapevine telegraph system which defies white understanding Everyone knew the details of the raid the killing of Frank Kennedy and crippled Tommy Wellburn and how Ashley was wounded in carrying Franks body away Some of the feeling of bitter hatred the women bore Scarlett for her share in the tragedy was mitigated by the knowledge that her husband was dead and she knew it and could not admit it and have the poor comfort of claiming his body Until morning light disclosed the bodies and the authorities notified her she must know nothing Frank and Tommy pistols in cold hands lay stiffening among the dead weeds in a vacant lot And the Yankees would say they killed each other in a common drunken brawl over a girl in Belles house Sympathy ran high for Fanny Tommys wife who had just had a baby but no one could slip through the darkness to see her and comfort her because a squad of Yankees surrounded the house waiting for Tommy to return And there was another squad about Aunt Pittys house waiting for Frank Before dawn the news had trickled about that the military inquiry would take place that day The townspeople heavy eyed from sleeplessness and anxious waiting knew that the safety of some of their most prominent citizens rested on three thingsthe ability of Ashley Wilkes to stand on his feet and appear before the military board as though he suffered nothing more serious than a morningafter headache the word of Belle Watling that these men had been in her house all evening and the word of Rhett Butler that he had been with them The town writhed at these last two Belle Watling To owe their mens lives to her It was intolerable Women who had  Page    Gone With The Wind ostentatiously crossed the street when they saw Belle coming wondered if she remembered and trembled for fear she did The men felt less humiliation at taking their lives from Belle than the women did for many of them thought her a good sort But they were stung that they must owe lives and freedom to Rhett Butler a speculator and a Scalawag Belle and Rhett the towns bestknown fancy woman and the towns most hated man And they must be under obligation to them Another thought that stung them to impotent wrath was the knowledge that the Yankees and Carpetbaggers would laugh Oh how they would laugh Twelve of the towns most prominent citizens revealed as habitual frequenters of Belle Watlings sporting house Two of them killed in a fight over a cheap little girl others ejected from the place as too drunk to be tolerated even by Belle and some under arrest refusing to admit they were there when everyone knew they were there Atlanta was right in fearing that the Yankees would laugh They had squirmed too long beneath Southern coldness and contempt and now they exploded with hilarity Officers woke comrades and retailed the news Husbands roused wives at dawn and told them as much as could be decently told to women And the women dressing hastily knocked on their neighbors doors and spread the story The Yankee ladies were charmed with it all and laughed until tears ran down their faces This was Southern chivalry and gallantry for you Maybe those women who carried their heads so high and snubbed all attempts at friendliness wouldnt be so uppity now that everyone knew where their husbands spent their time when they were supposed to be at political meetings Political meetings Well that was funny But even as they laughed they expressed regret for Scarlett and her tragedy After all Scarlett was a lady and one of the few ladies in Atlanta who were nice to Yankees She had already won their sympathy by the fact that she had to work because her husband couldnt or wouldnt support her properly Even though her husband was a sorry one it was dreadful that the poor thing should discover he had been untrue to her And it was doubly dreadful that his death should occur simultaneously with the discovery of his infidelity After all a poor husband was better than no husband at all and the Yankee ladies decided theyd be extra nice to Scarlett But the others Mrs Meade Mrs Merriwether Mrs Elsing Tommy Wellburns widow and most of all Mrs Ashley Wilkes theyd laugh in their faces every time they saw them That would teach them a little courtesy Much of the whispering that went on in the dark rooms on the north side of town that night was on this same subject Atlanta ladies vehemently told their husbands that they did not care a rap what the Yankees thought But inwardly they felt that running an Indian gantlet would be infinitely preferable to suffering the ordeal of Yankee grins and not being able to tell the truth about their husbands Dr Meade beside himself with outraged dignity at the position into which Rhett had jockeyed him and the others told Mrs Meade that but for the fact that it would implicate the others he would rather confess and be hanged than say he had been at Belles house It is an insult to you Mrs Meade he fumed But everyone will know you werent there forfor The Yankees wont know Theyll have to believe it if we save our necks And theyll laugh The very thought that anyone will believe it and laugh infuriates me And it insults you becausemy dear I have always been faithful to you I know that and in the darkness Mrs Meade smiled and slipped a thin hand into the doctors But Id rather it were really true than have one hair of your head in danger Mrs Meade do you know what you are saying cried the doctor aghast at the unsuspected realism of his wife Yes I know Ive lost Darcy and Ive lost Phil and you are all I have and rather than lose you Id have you take up your permanent abode at that place You are distrait You cannot know what you are saying You old fool said Mrs Meade tenderly and laid her head against his sleeve Dr Meade fumed into silence and stroked her cheek and then exploded again And to be under obligation to that Butler man Hanging would be easy compared to that No not even if I owe him my life can I be polite to him His insolence is monumental and his shamelessness about his profiteering makes me boil To owe my life to a man who never went in the army Melly said he enlisted after Atlanta fell Its a lie Miss Melly will believe any plausible scoundrel And what I cant understand is why he is doing all thisgoing to all this trouble I hate to say it butwell theres always been talk about him and Mrs Kennedy Ive seen them coming in from rides together too often this last year He must have done it because of her If it was because of Scarlett he wouldnt have lifted his hand Hed have been glad to see Frank Kennedy hanged I think its because of Melly Mrs Meade you cant be insinuating that theres ever been anything between those two Oh dont be silly But shes always been unaccountably fond of him ever since he tried to get Ashley exchanged during the war And I must say this for him he never smiles in that nastynice way when hes with her Hes just as pleasant and thoughtful as can bereally a different man You can tell by the way he acts with Melly that he could be decent if he wanted to Now my idea of why hes doing all this is She paused Doctor you wont like my idea I dont like anything about this whole affair Well I think he did it partly for Mellys sake but mostly because he thought it would be a huge joke on us all Weve hated him so much and showed it so plainly and now hes got us in a fix where all of you have your choice of saying you were at that Watling womans house and shaming yourself and wives before the Yankeesor telling the truth and getting hanged And he knows well all be under obligation to him and hismistress and that wed almost rather be hanged than be obliged to them Oh Ill wager hes enjoying it The doctor groaned He did look amused when he took us upstairs in that place Doctor Mrs Meade hesitated what did it look like What are you saying Mrs Meade Her house What did it look like Are there cutglass chandeliers And red plush curtains and dozens of fulllength gilt mirrors And were the girlswere they unclothed  Page    Gone With The Wind Good God cried the doctor thunderstruck for it had never occurred to him that the curiosity of a chaste woman concerning her unchaste sisters was so devouring How can you ask such immodest questions You are not yourself I will mix you a sedative I dont want a sedative I want to know Oh dear this is my only chance to know what a bad house looks like and now you are mean enough not to tell me I noticed nothing I assure you I was too embarrassed at finding myself in such a place to take note of my surroundings said the doctor formally more upset at this unsuspected revelation of his wifes character than he had been by all the previous events of the evening If you will excuse me now I will try to get some sleep Well go to sleep then she answered disappointment in her tones Then as the doctor leaned over to remove his boots her voice spoke from the darkness with renewed cheerfulness I imagine Dolly has gotten it all out of old man Merriwether and she can tell me about it Good Heavens Mrs Meade Do you mean to tell me that nice women talk about such things among them Oh go to bed said Mrs Meade It sleeted the next day but as the wintry twilight drew on the icy particles stopped falling and a cold wind blew Wrapped in her cloak Melanie went bewilderedly down her front walk behind a strange negro coachman who had summoned her mysteriously to a closed carriage waiting in front of the house As she came up to the carriage the door was opened and she saw a woman in the dim ulterior Leaning closer peering inside Melanie questioned Who is it Wont you come in the house Its so cold Please come in here and set with me a minute Miz Wilkes came a faintly familiar voice an embarrassed voice from the depths of the carriage Oh youre MissMrsWatling cried Melanie I did so want to see you You must come in the house I cant do that Miz Wilkes Belle Watlings voice sounded scandalized You come in here and set a minute with me Melanie entered the carriage and the coachman closed the door behind her She sat down beside Belle and reached for her hand How can I ever thank you enough for what you did today How can any of us thank you enough Miz Wilkes you hadnt ought of sent me that note this mornin Not that I wasnt proud to have a note from you but the Yankees might of got it And as for sayin you was goin to call on me to thank mewhy Miz Wilkes you must of lost your mind The very idea I come up here as soon as twas dark to tell you you mustnt think of any sech thing Why Iwhy youit wouldnt be fittin at all It wouldnt be fitting for me to call and thank a kind woman who saved my husbands life Oh shucks Miz Wilkes You know what I mean Melanie was silent for a moment embarrassed by the implication Somehow this handsome sedately dressed woman sitting in the darkness of the carriage didnt look and talk as she imagined a bad woman the Madam of a House should look and talk She sounded likewell a little common and countrified but nice and warm hearted You were wonderful before the provost marshal today Mrs Watling You and the otheryourthe young ladies certainly saved our mens lives Mr Wilkes was the wonderful one I dont know how he even stood up and told his story much less look as cool as he done He was sure bleedin like a pig when I seen him last night Is he goin to be all right Miz Wilkes Yes thank you The doctor says its just a flesh wound though he did lose a tremendous lot of blood This morning he waswell he was pretty well laced with brandy or hed never have had the strength to go through with it all so well But it was you Mrs Watling who saved them When you got mad

said Belle That wouldnt be fittin Good night CHAPTER XLVII SCARLETT SAT in her bedroom picking at the supper tray Mammy had brought her listening to the wind hurling itself out of the night The house was frighteningly still quieter even than when Frank had lain in the parlor just a few hours before Then there had been tiptoeing feet and hushed voices muffled knocks on the door neighbors rustling in to whisper sympathy and occasional sobs from Franks sister who had come up from Jonesboro for the funeral But now the house was cloaked in silence Although her door was open she could hear no sounds from below stairs Wade and the baby had been at Melanies since Franks body was brought home and she missed the sound of the boys feet and Ellas gurgling There was a truce in the kitchen and no sound of quarreling from Peter Mammy and Cookie floated up to her Even Aunt Pitty downstairs in the library was not rocking her creaking chair in deference to Scarletts sorrow No one intruded upon her believing that she wished to be left alone with her grief but to be left alone was the last thing Scarlett desired Had it only been grief that companioned her she could have borne it as she had borne other griefs But added to her stunned sense of loss at Franks death were fear and remorse and the torment of a suddenly awakened conscience For the first time in her life she was regretting things she had done regretting them with a sweeping superstitious fear that made her cast sidelong glances at the bed upon which she had lain with Frank She had killed Frank She had killed him just as surely as if it had been her finger that pulled the trigger He had begged her not to go about alone but she had not listened to him And now he was dead because of her obstinacy God would punish her for that But there lay upon her conscience another matter that was heavier and more frightening even than causing his deatha matter which had never troubled her until she looked upon his coffined face There had been something helpless and pathetic in that still face which had accused her God would punish her for marrying him when he really loved Suellen She would have to cower at the seat of judgment and answer for that lie she told him coming back from the Yankee camp in his buggy Useless for her to argue now that the end justified the means that she was driven into trapping him that the fate of too many people hung on her for her to consider either his or Suellens rights and happiness The truth stood out boldly and she cowered away from it She had married him coldly and used him coldly And she had made him unhappy during the last six months when she could have made him very happy God would punish her for not being nicer to himpunish her for all her bullyings and proddings and storms of temper and cutting remarks for alienating his friends and shaming him by operating the mills and building the saloon and leasing convicts She had made him very unhappy and she knew it but he had borne it all like a gentleman The only thing she had ever done that gave him any real happiness was to present him with Ella And she knew if she could have kept from having Ella Ella would never have been born She shivered frightened wishing Frank were alive so she could be nice to him so very nice to him to make up for it all Oh if only God did not seem so furious and vengeful Oh if only the minutes did not go by so slowly and the house were not so still If only she were not so alone If only Melanie were with her Melanie could calm her fears But Melanie was at home nursing Ashley For a moment Scarlett thought of summoning Pittypat to stand between her and her conscience but she hesitated Pitty would probably make matters worse for she honestly mourned Frank He had been more her contemporary than Scarletts and she had been devoted to him He had filled to perfection Pittys need for a man in the house for he brought her little presents and harmless gossip jokes and stories read the paper to her at night and explained topics of the day to her while she mended his socks She had fussed over him and planned special dishes for him and coddled him during his innumerable colds Now she missed him acutely and repeated over and over as she dabbed at her red swollen eyes If only he hadnt gone out with the Klan If there were only someone who could comfort her quiet her fears explain to her just what were these confused fears which made her heart sink with such cold sickness If only Ashleybut she shrank from the thought She had almost killed Ashley just as she had killed Frank And if Ashley ever knew the real truth about how she lied to Frank to get him knew how mean she had been to Frank he could never love her any more Ashley was so honorable so truthful so kind and he saw so straightly so clearly If he knew the whole truth he would understand Oh yes he would understand only too well But he would never love her any more So he must never know the truth because he must keep on loving her How could she live if that secret source of her strength his love were taken from her But what a relief it would be to put her head on his shoulder and cry and unburden her guilty heart  Page    Gone With The Wind The still house with the sense of death heavy upon it pressed about her loneliness until she felt she could not bear it unaided any longer She arose cautiously pushed her door halfclosed and then dug about in the bottom bureau drawer beneath her underwear She produced Aunt Pittys swoon bottle of brandy which she had hidden there and held it up to the lamp It was nearly halfempty Surely she hadnt drunk that much since last night She poured a generous amount into her water glass and gulped it down She would have to put the bottle back in the cellaret before morning filled to the top with water Mammy had hunted for it just before the funeral when the pallbearers wanted a drink and already the air in the kitchen was electric with suspicion between Mammy Cookie and Peter The brandy burned with fiery pleasantness There was nothing like it when you needed it In fact brandy was good almost any time so much better than insipid wine Why on earth should it be proper for a woman to drink wine and not spirits Mrs Merriwether and Mrs Meade had sniffed her breath most obviously at the funeral and she had seen the triumphant look they had exchanged The old cats She poured another drink It wouldnt matter if she did get a little tipsy tonight for she was going to bed soon and she could gargle cologne before Mammy came up to unlace her She wished she could get as completely and thoughtlessly drunk as Gerald used to get on Court Day Then perhaps she could forget Franks sunken face accusing her of ruining his life and then killing him She wondered if everyone in town thought she had killed him Certainly the people at the funeral had been cold to her The only people who had put any warmth into their expressions of sympathy were the wives of the Yankee officers with whom she did business Well she didnt care what the town said about her How unimportant that seemed beside what she would have to answer for to God She took another drink at the thought shuddering as the hot brandy went down her throat She felt very warm now but still she couldnt get the thought of Frank out of her mind What fools men were when they said liquor made people forget Unless she drank herself into insensibility shed still see Franks face as it had looked the last time he begged her not to drive alone timid reproachful apologetic The knocker on the front door hammered with a dull sound that made the still house echo and she heard Aunt Pittys waddling steps crossing the hall and the door opening There was the sound of greeting and an indistinguishable murmur Some neighbor calling to discuss the funeral or to bring a blanc mange Pitty would like that She had taken an important and melancholy pleasure in talking to the condolence callers She wondered incuriously who it was and when a mans voice resonant and drawling rose above Pittys funereal whispering she knew Gladness and relief flooded her It was Rhett She had not seen him since he broke the news of Franks death to her and now she knew deep in her heart that he was the one person who could help her tonight I think shell see me Rhetts voice floated up to her But she is lying down now Captain Butler and wont see anyone Poor child she is quite prostrated She I think she will see me Please tell her I am going away tomorrow and may be gone some time Its very important But fluttered Aunt Pittypat Scarlett ran out into the hall observing with some astonishment that her knees were a little unsteady and leaned over the banisters Ill be down terrectly Rhett she called She had a glimpse of Aunt Pittypats plump upturned face her eyes owlish with surprise and disapproval Now itll be all over town that I conducted myself most improperly on the day of my husbands funeral thought Scarlett as she hurried back to her room and began smoothing her hair She buttoned her black basque up to the chin and pinned down the collar with Pittypats mourning brooch I dont look very pretty she thought leaning toward the mirror too white and scared For a moment her hand went toward the lock box where she kept her rouge hidden but she decided against it Poor Pittypat would be upset in earnest if she came downstairs pink and blooming She picked up the cologne bottle and took a large mouthful carefully rinsed her mouth and then spit into the slop jar She rustled down the stairs toward the two who still stood in the hall for Pittypat had been too upset by Scarletts action to ask Rhett to sit down He was decorously clad in black his linen frilly and starched and his manner was all that custom demanded from an old friend paying a call of sympathy on one bereaved In fact it was so perfect that it verged on the burlesque though Pittypat did not see it He was properly apologetic for disturbing Scarlett and regretted that in his rush of closing up business before leaving town he had been unable to be present at the funeral Whatever possessed him to come wondered Scarlett He doesnt mean a word hes saying I hate to intrude on you at this time but I have a matter of business to discuss that will not wait Something that Mr Kennedy and I were planning I didnt know you and Mr Kennedy had business dealings said Aunt Pittypat almost indignant that some of Franks activities were unknown to her Mr Kennedy was a man of wide interests said Rhett respectfully Shall we go into the parlor No cried Scarlett glancing at the closed folding doors She could still see the coffin in that room She hoped she never had to enter it again Pitty for once took a hint although with none too good grace Do use the library I mustI must go upstairs and get out the mending Dear me Ive neglected it so this last week I declare She went up the stairs with a backward look of reproach which was noticed by neither Scarlett nor Rhett He stood aside to let her pass before him into the library What business did you and Frank have she questioned abruptly He came closer and whispered None at all I just wanted to get Miss Pitty out of the way He paused as he leaned over her Its no good Scarlett What The cologne  Page    Gone With The Wind Im sure I dont know what you mean Im sure you do Youve been drinking pretty heavily Well what if I have Is it any of your business The soul of courtesy even in the depths of sorrow Dont drink alone Scarlett People always find it out and it ruins the reputation And besides its a bad business this drinking alone Whats the matter honey He led her to the rosewood sofa and she sat down in silence May I close the doors She knew if Mammy saw the closed doors she would be scandalized and would lecture and grumble about it for days but it would be still worse if Mammy should overhear this discussion of drinking especially in light of the missing brandy bottle She nodded and Rhett drew the sliding doors together When he came back and sat down beside her his dark eyes alertly searching her face the pall of death receded before the vitality he radiated and the room seemed pleasant and homelike again the lamps rosy and warm Whats the matter honey No one in the world could say that foolish word of endearment as caressingly as Rhett even when he was joking but he did not look as if he were joking now She raised tormented eyes to his face and somehow found comfort in the blank inscrutability she saw there She did not know why this should be for he was such an unpredictable callous person Perhaps it was because as he often said they were so much alike Sometimes she thought that all the people she had ever known were strangers except Rhett Cant you tell me he took her hand oddly gentle Its more than old Frank leaving you Do you need money Money God no Oh Rhett Im so afraid Dont be a goose Scarlett youve never been afraid in your life Oh Rhett I am afraid The words bubbled up faster than she could speak them She could tell him She could tell Rhett anything Hed been so bad himself that he wouldnt sit in judgment on her How wonderful to know someone who was bad and dishonorable and a cheat and a liar when all the world was filled with people who would not lie to save their souls and who would rather starve than do a dishonorable deed Im afraid Ill die and go to hell If he laughed at her she would die right then But he did not laugh You are pretty healthyand maybe there isnt any hell after all Oh but there is Rhett You know there is I know there is but its right here on earth Not after we die Theres nothing after we die Scarlett You are having your hell now Oh Rhett thats blasphemous But singularly comforting Tell me why are you going to hell He was teasing now she could see the glint in his eyes but she did not mind His hands felt so warm and strong so comforting to cling to Rhett I oughtnt to have married Frank It was wrong He was Suellens beau and he loved her not me But I lied to him and told him she was going to marry Tony Fontaine Oh how could I have done it Ah so that was how it came about I always wondered And then I made him so miserable I made him do all sorts of things he didnt want to do like making people pay their bills when they really couldnt afford to pay them And it hurt him so when I ran the mills and built the saloon and leased convicts He could hardly hold up his head for shame And Rhett I killed him Yes I did I didnt know he was in the Klan I never dreamed he had that much gumption But I ought to have known And I killed him  Will all great Neptunes ocean wash this blood clean from my hand  What No matter Go on Go on Thats all Isnt it enough I married him I made him unhappy and I killed him Oh my God I dont see how I could have done it I lied to him and I married him It all seemed so right when I did it but now I see how wrong it was Rhett it doesnt seem like it was me who did all these things I was so mean to him but Im not really mean I wasnt raised that way Mother She stopped and swallowed She had avoided thinking of Ellen all day but she could no longer blot out her image I often wondered what she was like You seemed to me so like your father Mother was Oh Rhett for the first time Im glad shes dead so she cant see me She didnt raise me to be mean She was so kind to everybody so good Shed rather Id have starved than done this And I so wanted to be just like her in every way and Im not like her one bit I hadnt thought of thattheres been so much else to think aboutbut I wanted to be like her I didnt want to be like Pa I loved him but he wassoso thoughtless Rhett sometimes I did try so hard to be nice to people and kind to Frank but then the nightmare would come back and scare me so bad Id want to rush out and just grab money away from people whether it was mine or not Tears were streaming unheeded down her face and she clutched his hand so hard that her nails dug into his flesh What nightmare His voice was calm and soothing OhI forgot you didnt know Well just when I would try to be nice to folks and tell myself that money wasnt everything Id go to bed and dream that I was back at Tara right after Mother died right after the Yankees went through Rhett you cant imagine I get cold when I think about it I can see how everything is burned and so still and theres nothing to eat Oh Rhett in my dream Im hungry again Go on Im hungry and everybody Pa and the girls and the darkies are starving and they keep saying over and over Were hungry and Im so empty it hurts and so frightened My mind keeps saying If I ever get out of this Ill never never be hungry again  Page    Gone With The Wind and then the dream goes off into a gray mist and Im running running in the mist running so hard my hearts about to burst and something is chasing me and I cant breathe but I keep thinking that if I can just get there Ill be safe But I dont know where Im trying to get to And then Id wake up and Id be cold with fright and so afraid that Id be hungry again When I wake up from that dream it seems like theres not enough money in the world to keep me from being afraid of being hungry again And then Frank would be so mealy mouthed and slow poky that he would make me mad and Id lose my temper He didnt understand I guess and I couldnt make him understand I kept thinking that Id make it up to him some day when we had money and I wasnt so afraid of being hungry And now hes dead and its too late Oh it seemed so right when I did it but it was all so wrong If I had it to do over again Id do it so differently Hush he said disentangling her frantic grip and pulling a clean handkerchief from his pocket Wipe your face There is no sense in your tearing yourself to pieces this way She took the handkerchief and wiped her damp cheeks a little relief stealing over her as if she had shifted some of her burden to his broad shoulders He looked so capable and calm and even the slight twist of his mouth was comforting as though it proved her agony and confusion unwarranted Feel better now Then lets get to the bottom of this You say if you had it to do over again youd do it differently But would you Think now Would you Well No youd do the same things again Did you have any other choice No Then what are you sorry about I was so mean and now hes dead And if he wasnt dead youd still be mean As I understand it you are not really sorry for marrying Frank and bullying him and inadvertently causing his death You are only sorry because you are afraid of going to hell Is that right Wellthat sounds so mixed up Your ethics are considerably mixed up too You are in the exact position of a thief whos been caught red handed and isnt sorry he stole but is terribly terribly sorry hes going to jail A thief Oh dont be so literal In other words if you didnt have this silly idea that you were damned to hell fire eternal youd think you were well rid of Frank Oh Rhett Oh come You are confessing and you might as well confess the truth as a decorous lie Did yourerconscience bother you much when you offered toshall we saypart with that jewel which is dearer than life for three hundred dollars The brandy was spinning in her head now and she felt giddy and a little reckless What was the use in lying to him He always seemed to read her mind I really didnt think about God much thenor hell And when I did thinkwell I just reckoned God would understand But you dont credit God with understanding why you married Frank Rhett how can you talk so about God when you know you dont believe there is one But you believe in a God of Wrath and thats whats important at present Why shouldnt the Lord understand Are you sorry you still own Tara and there arent Carpetbaggers living there Are you sorry you arent hungry and ragged Oh no Well did you have any alternative except marrying Frank No He didnt have to marry you did he Men are free agents And he didnt have to let you bully him into doing things he didnt want to did he Well Scarlett why worry about it If you had it to do over again you would be driven to the lie and he to marrying you You would still have run yourself into danger and he would have had to avenge you If he had married Sister Sue she might not have caused his death but shed probably have made him twice as unhappy as you did It couldnt have happened differently But I could have been nicer to him You could have beenif youd been somebody else But you were born to bully anyone wholl let you do it The strong were made to bully and the weak to knuckle under Its all Franks fault for not beating you with a buggy whip  Im surprised at you Scarlett for sprouting a conscience this late in life Opportunists like you shouldnt have them What is an opporwhat did you call it A person who takes advantage of opportunities Is that wrong It has always been held in disreputeespecially by those who had the same opportunities and didnt take them Oh Rhett you are joking and I thought you were going to be nice I am being nicefor me Scarlett darling you are tipsy Thats whats the matter with you You dare Yes I dare You are on the verge of what is vulgarly called a crying jag and so I shall change the subject and cheer you up by telling you some news that will amuse you In fact thats why I came here this evening to tell you my news before I went away Where are you going To England and I may be gone for months Forget your conscience Scarlett I have no intention of discussing your souls welfare any further Dont you want to hear my news But she began feebly and paused Between the brandy which was smoothing out the harsh contours of remorse and Rhetts mocking but comforting words the pale specter of Frank was receding into shadows Perhaps Rhett was right Perhaps God did  Page    Gone With The Wind understand She recovered enough to push the idea from the top of her mind and decide Ill think about it all tomorrow Whats your news she said with an effort blowing her nose on his handkerchief and pushing back the hair that had begun to straggle My news is this he answered grinning down at her I still want you more than any woman Ive ever seen and now that Franks gone I thought youd be interested to know it Scarlett jerked her hands away from his grasp and sprang to her feet Iyou are the most illbred man in the world coming here at this time of all times with your filthyI should have known youd never change And Frank hardly cold If you had any decency Will you leave this Do be quiet or youll have Miss Pittypat down here in a minute he said not rising but reaching up and taking both her fists Im afraid you miss my point Miss your point I dont miss anything She pulled against his grip Turn me loose and get out of here I never heard of such bad taste I Hush he said I am asking you to marry me Would you be convinced if I knelt down She said Oh breathlessly and sat down hard on the sofa She stared at him her mouth open wondering if the brandy were playing tricks on her mind remembering senselessly his jibing My dear Im not a marrying man She was drunk or he was crazy But he did not look crazy He looked as calm as though he were discussing the weather and his smooth drawl fell on her ears with no particular emphasis I always intended having you Scarlett since that first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks when you threw that vase and swore and proved that you werent a lady I always intended having you one way or another But as you and Frank have made a little money I know youll never be driven to me again with any interesting propositions of loans and collaterals So I see Ill have to marry you Rhett Butler is this one of your vile jokes I bare my soul and you are suspicious No Scarlett this is a bona fide honorable declaration I admit that its not in the best of taste coming at this time but I have a very good excuse for my lack of breeding Im going away tomorrow for a long time and I fear that if I wait till I return youll have married some one else with a little money So I thought why not me and my money Really Scarlett I cant go all my life waiting to catch you between husbands He meant it There was no doubt about it Her mouth was dry as she assimilated this knowledge and she swallowed and looked into his eyes trying to find some clue They were full of laughter but there was something else deep in them which she had never seen before a gleam that defied analysis He sat easily carelessly but she felt that he was watching her as alertly as a cat watches a mouse hole There was a sense of leashed power straining beneath his calm that made her draw back a little frightened He was actually asking her to marry him he was committing the incredible Once she had planned how she would torment him should he ever propose Once she had thought that if he ever spoke those words she would humble him and make him feel her power and take a malicious pleasure in doing it Now he had spoken and the plans did not even occur to her for he was no more in her power than he had ever been In fact he held the whip hand of the situation so completely that she was as flustered as a girl at her first proposal and she could only blush and stammer II shall never marry again Oh yes you will You were born to be married Why not me But Rhett II dont love you That should be no drawback I dont recall that love was prominent in your other two ventures Oh how can you You know I was fond of Frank He said nothing I was I was Well we wont argue that Will you think over my proposition while Im gone Rhett I dont like for things to drag on Id rather tell you now Im going home to Tara soon and India Wilkes will stay with Aunt Pittypat I want to go home for a long spell andII dont ever want to get married again Nonsense Why Oh wellnever mind why I just dont like being married But my poor child youve never really been married How can you know Ill admit youve had bad luckonce for spite and once for money Did you ever think of marryingjust for the fun of it Fun Dont talk like a fool Theres no fun being married No Why not A measure of calm had returned and with it all the natural bluntness which brandy brought to the surface Its fun for menthough God knows why I never could understand it But all a woman gets out of it is something to eat and a lot of work and having to put up with a mans foolishnessand a baby every year He laughed so loudly that the sound echoed in the stillness and Scarlett heard the kitchen door open Hush Mammy has ears like a lynx and it isnt decent to laugh so soon afterhush laughing You know its true Fun Fiddledeedee I said youd had bad luck and what youve just said proves it Youve been married to a boy and to an old man And into the bargain Ill bet your mother told you that women must bear these things because of the compensating joys of motherhood Well thats all wrong Why not try marrying a fine young man who has a bad reputation and a way with women Itll be fun You are coarse and conceited and I think this conversation has gone far enough Itsits quite vulgar And quite enjoyable too isnt it Ill wager you never discussed the marital relation with a man before even Charles or Frank She scowled at him Rhett knew too much She wondered where he had learned all he knew about women It wasnt decent Dont frown Name the day Scarlett Im not urging instant matrimony because of your reputation Well wait the decent  Page    Gone With The Wind interval By the way just how long is a decent interval I havent said Id marry you It isnt decent to even talk of such things at such a time Ive told you why Im talking of them Im going away tomorrow and Im too ardent a lover to restrain my passion any longer But perhaps Ive been too precipitate in my wooing With a suddenness that startled her he slid off the sofa onto his knees and with one hand placed delicately over his heart he recited rapidly Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments my dear ScarlettI mean my dear Mrs Kennedy It cannot have escaped your notice that for some time past the friendship I have had in my heart for you has ripened into a deeper feeling a feeling more beautiful more pure more sacred Dare I name it you Ah It is love which makes me so bold Do get up she entreated You look such a fool and suppose Mammy should come in and see you She would be stunned and incredulous at the first signs of my gentility said Rhett arising lightly Come Scarlett you are no child no schoolgirl to put me off with foolish excuses about decency and so forth Say youll marry me when I come back or before God I wont go Ill stay around here and play a guitar under your window every night and sing at the top of my voice and compromise you so youll have to marry me to save your reputation Rhett do be sensible I dont want to marry anybody No You arent telling me the real reason It cant be girlish timidity What is it Suddenly she thought of Ashley saw him as vividly as though he stood beside her sunny haired drowsy eyed full of dignity so utterly different from Rhett He was the real reason she did not want to marry again although she had no objections to Rhett and at times was genuinely fond of him She belonged to Ashley forever and ever She had never belonged to Charles or Frank could never really belong to Rhett Every part of her almost everything she had ever done striven after attained belonged to Ashley were done because she loved him Ashley and Tara she belonged to them The smiles the laughter the kisses she had given Charles and Frank were Ashleys even though he had never claimed them would never claim them Somewhere deep in her was the desire to keep herself for him although she knew he would never take her She did not know that her face had changed that reverie had brought a softness to her face which Rhett had never seen before He looked at the slanting green eyes wide and misty and the tender curve of her lips and for a moment his breath stopped Then his mouth went down violently at one corner and he swore with passionate impatience Scarlett OHara youre a fool Before she could withdraw her mind from its far places his arms were around her as sure and hard as on the dark road to Tara so long ago She felt again the rush of helplessness the sinking yielding the surging tide of warmth that left her limp And the quiet face of Ashley Wilkes was blurred and drowned to nothingness He bent back her head across his arm and kissed her softly at first and then with a swift gradation of intensity that made her cling to him as the only solid thing in a dizzy swaying world His insistent mouth was parting her shaking lips sending wild tremors along her nerves evoking from her sensations she had never known she was capable of feeling And before a swimming giddiness spun her round and round she knew that she was kissing him back Stopplease Im faint she whispered trying to turn her head weakly from him He pressed her head back hard against his shoulder and she had a dizzy glimpse of his face His eyes were wide and blazing queerly and the tremor in his arms frightened her I want to make you faint I will make you faint Youve had this coming to you for years None of the fools youve known have kissed you like thishave they Your precious Charles or Frank or your stupid Ashley Please I said your stupid Ashley Gentlemen allwhat do they know about women What did they know about you I know you His mouth was on hers again and she surrendered without a struggle too weak even to turn her head without even the desire to turn it her heart shaking her with its poundings fear of his strength and her nerveless weakness sweeping her What was he going to do She would faint if he did not stop If he would only stopif he would never stop Say Yes His mouth was poised above hers and his eyes were so close that they seemed enormous filling the world Say Yes damn you or She whispered Yes before she even thought It was almost as if he had willed the word and she had spoken it without her own volition But even as she spoke it a sudden calm fell on her spirit her head began to stop spinning and even the giddiness of the brandy was lessened She had promised to marry him when she had had no intention of promising She hardly knew how it had all come about but she was not sorry It now seemed very natural that she had said Yesalmost as if by divine intervention a hand stronger than hers was about her affairs settling her problems for her He drew a quick breath as she spoke and bent as if to kiss her again and her eyes closed and her head fell back But he drew back and she was faintly disappointed It made her feel so strange to be kissed like this and yet there was something exciting about it He sat very still for a while holding her head against his shoulder and as if by effort the trembling of his arms ceased He moved away from her a little and looked down at her She opened her eyes and saw that the frightening glow had gone from his face But somehow she could not meet his gaze and she dropped her eyes in a rush of tingling confusion When he spoke his voice was very calm You meant it You dont want to take it back No Its not just because Ivewhat is the phraseswept you off your feet by myerardor She could not answer for she did not know what to say nor could she meet his eyes He put a hand under her chin and lifted her face I told you once that I could stand anything from you except a lie And now I want the truth Just why did you say Yes Still the words would not come but a measure of poise returning she kept her eyes demurely down and tucked the corners of  Page    Gone With The Wind her mouth into a little smile Look at me Is it my money Why Rhett What a question Look up and dont try to sweet talk me Im not Charles or Frank or any of the County boys to be taken in by your fluttering lids Is it my money Wellyes a part A part He did not seem annoyed He drew a swift breath and with an effort wiped from his eyes the eagerness her words had brought an eagerness which she was too confused to see Well she floundered helplessly money does help you know Rhett and God knows Frank didnt leave any too much But thenwell Rhett we do get on you know And you are the only man I ever saw who could stand the truth from a woman and it would be nice having a husband who didnt think me a silly fool and expect me to tell liesandwell I am fond of you Fond of me Well she said fretfully if I said I was madly in love with you Id be lying and whats more youd know it Sometimes I think you carry your truth telling too far my pet Dont you think even if it was a lie that it would be appropriate for you to say I love you Rhett even if you didnt mean it What was he driving at she wondered becoming more confused He looked so queer eager hurt mocking He took his hands from her and shoved them deep in his trousers pockets and she saw him ball his fists If it costs me a husband Ill tell the truth she thought grimly her blood up as always when he baited her Rhett it would be a lie and why should we go through all that foolishness Im fond of you like I said You know how it is You told me once that you didnt love me but that we had a lot in common Both rascals was the way you Oh God be whispered rapidly turning his head away To be taken in my own trap What did you say Nothing and he looked at her and laughed but it was not a pleasant laugh Name the day my dear and he laughed again and bent and kissed her hands She was relieved to see his mood pass and good humor apparently return so she smiled too He played with her hand for a moment and grinned up at her Did you ever in your novel reading come across the old situation of the disinterested wife falling in love with her own husband You know I dont read novels she said and trying to equal his jesting mood went on Besides you once said it was the height of bad form for husbands and wives to love each other I once said too God damn many things he retorted abruptly and rose to his feet Dont swear Youll have to get used to it and learn to swear too Youll have to get used to all my bad habits Thatll be part of the price of beingfond of me and getting your pretty paws on my money Well dont fly off the handle so because I didnt lie and make you feel conceited You arent in love with me are you Why should I be in love with you No my dear Im not in love with you no more than you are with me and if I were you would be the last person Id ever tell God help the man who ever really loves you Youd break his heart my darling cruel destructive little cat who is so careless and confident she doesnt even trouble to sheathe her claws He jerked her to her feet and kissed her again but this time his lips were different for he seemed not to care if he hurt herseemed to want to hurt her to insult her His lips slid down to her throat and finally he pressed them against the taffeta over her breast so hard and so long that his breath burnt to her skin Her hands struggled up pushing him away in outraged modesty You mustnt How dare you Your hearts going like a rabbits he said mockingly All too fast for mere fondness I would think if I were conceited Smooth your ruffled feathers You are just putting on these virginal airs Tell me what I shall bring you from England A ring What kind would you like She wavered momentarily between interest in his last words and a feminine desire to prolong the scene with anger and indignation Oha diamond ringand Rhett do buy a great big one So you can flaunt it before your povertystricken friends and say See what I caught Very well you shall have a big one one so big that your lessfortunate friends can comfort themselves by whispering that its really vulgar to wear such large stones He abruptly started off across the room and she followed him bewildered to the closed doors What is the matter Where are you going To my rooms to finish packing Oh but But what Nothing I hope you have a nice trip Thank you He opened the door and walked into the hall Scarlett trailed after him somewhat at a loss a trifle disappointed as at an unexpected anticlimax He slipped on his coat and picked up his gloves and hat Ill write you Let me know if you change your mind Arent you Well He seemed impatient to be off Arent you going to kiss me goodby she whispered mindful of the ears of the house Dont you think youve had enough kissing for one evening he retorted and grinned down at her To think of a modest  Page    Gone With The Wind wellbroughtup young woman Well I told you it would be fun didnt I Oh you are impossible she cried in wrath not caring if Mammy did hear And I dont care if you never come back She turned and flounced toward the stairs expecting to feel his warm hand on her arm stopping her But he only pulled open the front door and a cold draft swept in But I will come back he said and went out leaving her on the bottom step looking at the closed door The ring Rhett brought back from England was large indeed so large it embarrassed Scarlett to wear it She loved gaudy and expensive jewelry but she had an uneasy feeling that everyone was saying with perfect truth that this ring was vulgar The central stone was a fourcarat diamond and surrounding it were a number of emeralds It reached to the knuckle of her finger and gave her hand the appearance of being weighted down Scarlett had a suspicion that Rhett had gone to great pains to have the ring made up and for pure meanness had ordered it made as ostentatious as possible Until Rhett was back in Atlanta and the ring on her finger she told no one not even her family of her intentions and when she did announce her engagement a storm of bitter gossip broke out Since the Klan affair Rhett and Scarlett had been with the exception of the Yankees and Carpetbaggers the towns most unpopular citizens Everyone had disapproved of Scarlett since the faraway day when she abandoned the weeds worn for Charlie Hamilton Their disapproval had grown stronger because of her unwomanly conduct in the matter of the mills her immodesty in showing herself when she was pregnant and so many other things But when she brought about the death of Frank and Tommy and jeopardized the lives of a dozen other men their dislike flamed into public condemnation As for Rhett he had enjoyed the towns hatred since his speculations during the war and he had not further endeared himself to his fellow citizens by his alliances with the Republicans since then But oddly enough the fact that he had saved the lives of some of Atlantas most prominent men was what aroused the hottest hate of Atlantas ladies It was not that they regretted their men were still alive It was that they bitterly resented owing the mens lives to such a man as Rhett and to such an embarrassing trick For months they had writhed under Yankee laughter and scorn and the ladies felt and said that if Rhett really had the good of the Klan at heart he would have managed the affair in a more seemly fashion They said he had deliberately dragged in Belle Watling to put the nice people of the town in a disgraceful position And so he deserved nei ther thanks for rescuing the men nor forgiveness for his past sins These women so swift to kindness so tender to the sorrowing so untiring in times of stress could be as implacable as furies to any renegade who broke one small law of their unwritten code This code was simple Reverence for the Confederacy honor to the veterans loyalty to old forms pride in poverty open hands to friends and undying hatred to Yankees Between them Scarlett and Rhett had outraged every tenet of this code The men whose lives Rhett had saved attempted out of decency and a sense of gratitude to keep their women silent but they had little success Before the announcement of their coming marriage the two had been unpopular enough but people could still be polite to them in a formal way Now even that cold courtesy was no longer possible The news of their engagement came like an explosion unexpected and shattering rocking the town and even the mildestmannered women spoke their minds heatedly Marrying barely a year after Franks death and she had killed him And marrying that Butler man who owned a brothel and who was in with the Yankees and Carpetbaggers in all kinds of thieving schemes Separately the two of them could be endured but the brazen combination of Scarlett and Rhett was too much to be borne Common and vile both of them They ought to be run out of town Atlanta might perhaps have been more tolerant toward the two if the news of their engagement had not come at a time when Rhetts Carpetbagger and Scalawag cronies were more odious in the sight of respectable citizens than they had ever been before Public feeling against the Yankees and all their allies was at fever heat at the very time when the town learned of the engagement for the last citadel of Georgias resistance to Yankee rule had just fallen The long campaign which had begun when Sherman moved southward from above Dalton four years before had finally reached its climax and the states humiliation was complete Three years of Reconstruction had passed and they had been three years of terrorism Everyone had thought that conditions were already as bad as they could ever be But now Georgia was discovering that Reconstruction at its worst had just begun For three years the Federal government had been trying to impose alien ideas and an alien rule upon Georgia and with an army to enforce its commands it had largely succeeded But only the power of the military upheld the new regime The state was under the Yankee rule but not by the states consent Georgias leaders had kept on battling for the states right to govern itself according to its own ideas They had continued resisting all efforts to force them to bow down and accept the dictates of Washington as their own state law Officially Georgias government had never capitulated but it had been a futile fight an everlosing fight It was a fight that could not win but it had at least postponed the inevitable Already many other Southern states had illiterate negroes in high public office and legislatures dominated by negroes and Carpetbaggers But Georgia by its stubborn resistance had so far escaped this final degradation For the greater part of three years the states capital had remained in the control of white men and Democrats With Yankee soldiers everywhere the state officials could do little but protest and resist Their power was nominal but they had at least been able to keep the state government in the hands of native Georgians Now even that last stronghold had fallen Just as Johnston and his men had been driven back step by step from Dalton to Atlanta four years before so had the Georgia Democrats been driven back little by little from  on The power of the Federal government over the states affairs and the lives of its citizens had been steadily made greater and greater Force had been piled on top of force and military edicts in increasing numbers had rendered the civil authority more and more impotent Finally with Georgia in the status of a military province the polls had been ordered thrown open to the negroes whether the states laws permitted it or not A week before Scarlett and Rhett announced their engagement an election for governor had been held The Southern Democrats had General John B Gordon one of Georgias best loved and most honored citizens as their candidate Opposing him was a Republican named Bullock The election had lasted three days instead of one Trainloads of negroes had been rushed from town to town voting at every precinct along the way Of course Bullock had won  Page    Gone With The Wind If the capture of Georgia by Sherman had caused bitterness the final capture of the states capitol by the Carpetbaggers Yankees and negroes caused an intensity of bitterness such as the state had never known before Atlanta and Georgia seethed and raged And Rhett Butler was a friend of the hated Bullock Scarlett with her usual disregard of all matters not directly under her nose had scarcely known an election was being held Rhett had taken no part in the election and his relations with the Yankees were no different from what they had always been But the fact remained that Rhett was a Scalawag and a friend of Bullock And if the marriage went through Scarlett also would be turning Scalawag Atlanta was in no mood to be tolerant or charitable toward anyone in the enemy camp and the news of the engagement coming when it did the town remembered all of the evil things about the pair and none of the good Scarlett knew the town was rocking but she did not realize the extent of public feeling until Mrs Merriwether urged on by her church circle took it upon herself to speak to her for her own good Because your own dear mother is dead and Miss Pitty not being a matron is not qualified toer well to talk to youupon such a subject I feel that I must warn you Scarlett Captain Butler is not the kind of a man for any woman of good family to marry He is a He managed to save Grandpa Merriwethers neck and your nephews too Mrs Merriwether swelled Hardly an hour before she had had an irritating talk with Grandpa The old man had remarked that she must not value his hide very much if she did not feel some gratitude to Rhett Butler even if the man was a Scalawag and a scoundrel He only did that as a dirty trick on us all Scarlett to embarrass us in front of the Yankees Mrs Merriwether continued You know as well as I do that the man is a rogue He always has been and now hes unspeakable He is simply not the kind of man decent people receive No Thats strange Mrs Merriwether He was in your parlor often enough during the war And he gave Maybelle her white satin wedding dress didnt he Or is my memory wrong Things are so different during the war and nice people associated with many men who were not quite It was all for the Cause and very proper too Surely you cant be thinking of marrying a man who wasnt in the army who jeered at men who did enlist He was too in the army He was in the army eight months He was in the last campaign and fought at Franklin and was with General Johnston when he surrendered I had not heard that said Mrs Merriwether and she looked as if she did not believe it either But he wasnt wounded she added triumphantly Lots of men werent Everybody who was anybody got wounded I know no one who wasnt wounded Scarlett was goaded Then I guess all the men you knew were such fools they didnt know when to come in out of a shower of rainor of minie balls Now let me tell you this Mrs Merriwether and you can take it back to your busybody friends Im going to marry Captain Butler and I wouldnt care if hed fought on the Yankee side When that worthy matron went out of the house with her bonnet jerking with rage Scarlett knew she had an open enemy now instead of a disapproving friend But she did not care Nothing Mrs Merriwether could say or do could hurt her She did not care what anyone saidanyone except Mammy Scarlett had borne with Pittys swooning at the news and had steeled herself to see Ashley look suddenly old and avoid her eyes as he wished her happiness She had been amused and irritated at the letters from Aunt Pauline and Aunt Eulalie in Charleston horror struck at the news forbidding the marriage telling her it would not only ruin her social position but endanger theirs She had even laughed when Melanie with a worried pucker in her brows said loyally Of course Captain Butler is much nicer than most people realize and he was so kind and clever the way he saved Ashley And after all he did fight for the Confederacy But Scarlett dont you think youd better not decide so hastily No she didnt mind what anybody said except Mammy Mammys words were the ones that made her most angry and brought the greatest hurt Ah has seed you do a heap of things dat would hut Miss Ellen did she know An it has done sorrered me a pleny But disyere is de wust yit Mahyin

leavin you Ah gwine stay right hyah an see dis ting thoo Without waiting for a reply Mammy turned and left Scarlett and if she had said Thou shalt see me at Philippi her tones would not have been more ominous While they were honeymooning in New Orleans Scarlett told Rhett of Mammys words To her surprise and indignation he laughed at Mammys statement about mules in horse harness I have never heard a profound truth expressed so succinctly he said Mammys a smart old soul and one of the few people I know whose respect and good will Id like to have But being a mule I suppose Ill never get either from her She even refused the tendollar gold piece which I in my groomlike fervor wished to present her after the wedding Ive seen so few people who did not melt at the sight of cash But she looked me in the eye and thanked me and said she wasnt a free issue nigger and didnt need my money Why should she take on so Why should everybody gabble about me like a bunch of guinea hens Its my own affair whom I marry and how often I marry Ive always minded my own business Why dont other people mind theirs My pet the world can forgive practically anything except people who mind their own business But why should you squall like a scalded cat Youve said often enough that you didnt mind what people said about you Why not prove it You know youve laid yourself open to criticism so often in small matters you cant expect to escape gossip in this large matter You knew thered be talk if you married a villain like me If I were a lowbred povertystricken villain people wouldnt be so mad But a rich flourishing villainof course thats unforgivable I wish youd be serious sometimes I am serious Its always annoying to the godly when the ungodly flourish like the green bay tree Cheer up Scarlett didnt you tell me once that the main reason you wanted a lot of money was so you could tell everybody to go to hell Nows your chance But you were the main one I wanted to tell to go to hell said Scarlett and laughed Do you still want to tell me to go to hell Well not as often as I used to Do it whenever you like if it makes you happy It doesnt make me especially happy said Scarlett and bending she kissed him carelessly His dark eyes flickered quickly over her face hunting for something in her eyes which he did not find and he laughed shortly Forget about Atlanta Forget about the old cats I brought you to New Orleans to have fun and I intend that you shall have it Part Five CHAPTER XLVIII SHE DID HAVE FUN more fun than she had had since the spring before the war New Orleans was such a strange glamorous place and Scarlett enjoyed it with the headlong pleasure of a pardoned life prisoner The Carpetbaggers were looting the town many honest folk were driven from their homes and did not know where to look for their next meal and a negro sat in the lieutenant governors chair But the New Orleans Rhett showed her was the gayest place she had ever seen The people she met seemed to have all the money they wanted and no cares at all Rhett introduced her to dozens of women pretty women in bright gowns women who had soft hands that showed no signs of hard work women who laughed at everything and never talked of stupid serious things or hard times And the men she methow thrilling they were And how different from Atlanta menand how they fought to dance with her and paid her the most extravagant compliments as though she were a young belle These men had the same hard reckless look Rhett wore Their eyes were always alert like men who have lived too long with danger to be ever quite careless They seemed to have no pasts or futures and they politely discouraged Scarlett when to make conversation she asked what or where they were before they came to New Orleans That in itself was strange for in Atlanta every respectable newcomer hastened to present his credentials to tell proudly of his home and family to trace the tortuous mazes of relationship that stretched over the entire South But these men were a taciturn lot picking their words carefully Sometimes when Rhett was alone with them and Scarlett in the next room she heard laughter and caught fragments of conversation that meant nothing to her scraps of words puzzling namesCuba and Nassau in the blockade days the gold rush and claim jumping gun running and filibustering Nicaragua and William Walker and how he died against a wall at Truxillo Once her sudden entrance abruptly terminated a conversation about what had happened to the members of Quantrills band of guerillas and she caught the names of Frank and Jesse James But they were all well mannered beautifully tailored and they evidently admired her so it mattered little to Scarlett that they chose to live utterly in the present What really mattered was that they were Rhetts friends and had large houses and fine carriages and they took her and Rhett driving invited them to suppers gave parties in their honor And Scarlett liked them very well Rhett was amused when she told him so I thought you would he said and laughed Why not her suspicions aroused as always by his laughter Theyre all secondraters black sheep rascals Theyre all adventurers or Carpetbag aristocrats They all made their money  Page    Gone With The Wind speculating in food like your loving husband or out of dubious government contracts or in shady ways that wont bear investigation I dont believe it Youre teasing Theyre the nicest people  The nicest people in town are starving said Rhett And living politely in hovels and I doubt if Id be received in those hovels You see my dear I was engaged in some of my nefarious schemes here during the war and these people have devilish long memories Scarlett you are a constant joy to me You unerringly manage to pick the wrong people and the wrong things But they are your friends Oh but I like rascals My early youth was spent as a gambler on a river boat and I can understand people like that But Im not blind to what they are Whereas you he laughed againyou have no instinct about people no discrimination between the cheap and the great Sometimes I think that the only great ladies youve ever associated with were your mother and Miss Melly and neither seems to have made any impression on you Melly Why shes as plain as an old shoe and her clothes always look tacky and she never has two words to say for herself Spare me your jealousy Madam Beauty doesnt make a lady nor clothes a great lady Oh dont they Just you wait Rhett Butler and Ill show you Now that Iveweve got money Im going to be the greatest lady you ever saw I shall wait with interest he said More exciting than the people she met were the frocks Rhett bought her superintending the choice of colors materials and designs himself Hoops were out now and the new styles were charming with the skirts pulled back from the front and draped over bustles and on the bustles were wreaths of Sowers and bows and cascades of lace She thought of the modest hoops of the war years and she felt a little embarrassed at these new skirts which undeniably outlined her abdomen And the darling little bonnets that were not really bonnets at all but flat little affairs worn over one eye and laden with fruits and flowers dancing plumes and fluttering ribbons If only Rhett had not been so silly and burned the false curls she bought to augment her knot of Indianstraight hair that peeked from the rear of these little hats And the delicate conventmade underwear How lovely it was and how many sets she had Chemises and nightgowns and petticoats of the finest linen trimmed with dainty embroidery and infinitesimal tucks And the satin slippers Rhett bought her They had heels three inches high and huge glittering paste buckles on them And silk stockings a dozen pairs and not a one had cotton tops What riches She recklessly bought gifts for the family A furry St Bernard puppy for Wade who had always longed for one a Persian kitten for Beau a coral bracelet for little Ella a heavy necklace with moonstone pendants for Aunt Pitty a complete set of Shakespeare for Melanie and Ashley an elaborate livery for Uncle Peter including a high silk coachmans hat with a brush upon it dress lengths for Dilcey and Cookie expensive gifts for everyone at Tara But what have you bought for Mammy questioned Rhett looking over the pile of gifts spread out on the bed in their hotel room and removing the puppy and kitten to the dressing room Not a thing She was hateful Why should I bring her a present when she called us mules Why should you so resent hearing the truth my pet You must bring Mammy a present It would break her heart if you didntand hearts like hers are too valuable to be broken I wont take her a thing She doesnt deserve it Then Ill buy her one I remember my mammy always said that when she went to Heaven she wanted a taffeta petticoat so stiff that it would stand by itself and so rustly that the Lord God would think it was made of angels wings Ill buy Mammy some red taffeta and have an elegant petticoat made She wont take it from you Shed die rather than wear it I dont doubt it But Ill make the gesture just the same The shops of New Orleans were so rich and exciting and shopping with Rhett was an adventure Dining with him was an adventure too and one more thrilling than shopping for he knew what to order and how it should be cooked The wines and liqueurs and champagnes of New Orleans were new and exhilarating to her acquainted with only homemade blackberry and scuppernong vintages and Aunt Pittys swoon brandy but oh the food Rhett ordered Best of all things in New Orleans was the food Remembering the bitter hungry days at Tara and her more recent penury Scarlett felt that she could never eat enough of these rich dishes Gumboes and shrimp Creole doves in wine and oysters in crumbly patties full of creamy sauce mushrooms and sweetbreads and turkey livers fish baked cunningly in oiled paper and limes Her appetite never dulled for whenever she remembered the everlasting goobers and dried peas and sweet potatoes at Tara she felt an urge to gorge herself anew of Creole dishes You eat as though each meal were your last said Rhett Dont scrape the plate Scarlett Im sure theres more in the kitchen You have only to ask the waiter If you dont stop being such a glutton youll be as fat as the Cuban ladies and then I shall divorce you But she only put out her tongue at him and ordered another pastry thick with chocolate and stuffed with meringue What fun it was to be able to spend as much money as you liked and not count pennies and feel that you should save them to pay taxes or buy mules What fun to be with people who were gay and rich and not genteelly poor like Atlanta people What fun to wear rustling brocade dresses that showed your waist and all your neck and arms and more than a little of your breast and know that men were admiring you And what fun to eat all you wanted without having censorious people say you werent ladylike And what fun to drink all the champagne you pleased The first time she drank too much she was embarrassed when she awoke the nextmorning with a splitting headache and an awful memory of singing Bonnie Blue Flag all the way back to the hotel through the streets of New Orleans in an open carriage She had never seen a lady even tipsy and the only drunken woman she had ever seen had been that Watling creature on the day when Atlanta fell She hardly knew how to face Rhett so great was her humiliation but the affair seemed only to amuse him Everything she did seemed to amuse him as though she were a gamboling kitten It was exciting to go out with him for he was so handsome Somehow she had never given his looks a thought before and in  Page    Gone With The Wind Atlanta everyone had been too preoccupied with his shortcomings ever to talk about his appearance But here in New Orleans she could see how the eyes of other women followed him and how they fluttered when he bent over their hands The realization that other women were attracted by her husband and perhaps envied her made her suddenly proud to be seen by his side Why were a handsome people thought Scarlett with pleasure Yes as Rhett had prophesied marriage could be a lot of fun Not only was it fun but she was learning many things That was odd in itself because Scarlett had thought life could teach her no more Now she felt like a child every day on the brink of a new discovery First she learned that marriage with Rhett was a far different matter from marriage with either Charles or Frank They had respected her and been afraid of her temper They had begged for favors and if it pleased her she had bestowed them Rhett did not fear her and she often thought did not respect her very much either What he wanted to do he did and if she did not like it he laughed at her She did not love him but he was undoubtedly an exciting person to live with The most exciting thing about him was that even in his outbursts of passion which were flavored sometimes with cruelty sometimes with irritating amusement he seemed always to be holding himself under restraint always riding his emotions with a curb bit I guess thats because he isnt really in love with me she thought and was content enough with the state of affairs I should hate for him to ever turn completely loose in any way But still the thought of the possibility teased her curiosity in an exciting way Living with Rhett she learned many new things about him and she had thought she knew him so well She learned that his voice could be as silky as a cats fur one moment and crisp and crackling with oaths the next He could tell with apparent sincerity and approval stories of courage and honor and virtue and love in the odd places he had been and follow them with ribald stories of coldest cynicism She knew no man should tell such stories to his wife but they were entertaining and they appealed to something coarse and earthy in her He could be an ardent almost a tender lover for a brief while and almost immediately a mocking devil who ripped the lid from her gunpowder temper fired it and enjoyed the explosion She learned that his compliments were always two edged and his tenderest expressions open to suspicion In fact in those two weeks in New Orleans she learned everything about him except what he really was Some mornings he dismissed the maid and brought her the breakfast tray himself and fed her as though she were a child took the hairbrush from her hand and brushed her long dark hair until it snapped and crackled Yet other mornings she was torn rudely out of deep slumber when he snatched all the bed covers from her and tickled her bare feet Sometimes he listened with dignified interest to details of her businesses nodding approval at her sagacity and at other times he called her somewhat dubious tradings scavenging highway robbery and extortion He took her to plays and annoyed her by whispering that God probably didnt approve of such amusements and to churches and sotto voice retailed funny obscenities and then reproved her for laughing He encouraged her to speak her mind to be flippant and daring She picked up from him the gift of stinging words and sardonic phrases and learned to relish using them for the power they gave her over other people But she did not possess his sense of humor which tempered his malice nor his smile that jeered at himself even while he was jeering others He made her play and she had almost forgotten how Life had been so serious and so bitter He knew how to play and swept her along with him But he never played like a boy he was a man and no matter what he did she could never forget it She could not look down on him from the heights of womanly superiority smiling as women have always smiled at the antics of men who are boys at heart This annoyed her a little whenever she thought of it It would be pleasant to feel superior to Rhett All the other men she had known she could dismiss with a halfcontemptuous What a child Her father the Tarleton twins with their love of teasing and their elaborate practical jokes the hairy little Fontaines with their childish rages Charles Frank all the men who had paid court to her during the wareveryone in fact except Ashley Only Ashley and Rhett eluded her understanding and her control for they were both adults and the elements of boyishness were lacking in them She did not understand Rhett nor did she trouble to understand him though there were things about him which occasionally puzzled her There was the way he looked at her sometimes when he thought she was unaware Turning quickly she frequently caught him watching her an alert eager waiting look in his eyes Why do you look at me like that she once asked irritably Like a cat at a mouse hole But his face had changed swiftly and he only laughed Soon she forgot it and did not puzzle her head about it any more or about anything concerning Rhett He was too unpredictable to bother about and life was very pleasantexcept when she thought of Ashley Rhett kept her too busy to think of Ashley often Ashley was hardly ever in her thoughts during the day but at night when she was tired from dancing or her head was spinning from too much champagnethen she thought of Ashley Frequently when she lay drowsily in Rhetts arms with the moonlight streaming over die bed she thought how perfect life would be if it were only Ashleys arms which held her so closely if it were only Ashley who drew her black hair across his face and wrapped it about his throat Once when she was thinking this she sighed and turned her head toward the window and after a moment she felt the heavy arm beneath her neck become like iron and Rhetts voice spoke in the stillness May God damn your cheating little soul to hell for all eternity And getting up he put on his shoes and left the room despite her startled protests and questions He reappeared the next morning as she was breakfasting in her room disheveled quite drunk and in his wont sarcastic mood and neither made excuses nor gave an account of his absence Scarlett asked no questions and was quite cool to him as became an injured wife and when she had finished the meal she dressed under his bloodshot gaze and went shopping He was gone when she returned and did not appear again until time for supper It was a silent meal and Scarletts temper was straining because it was her last supper in New Orleans and she wanted to do  Page    Gone With The Wind justice to the crawfish And she could not enjoy it under his gaze Nevertheless she ate a large one and drank a quantity of champagne Perhaps it was this combination that brought back her old nightmare that evening for she awoke cold with sweat sobbing brokenly She was back at Tara again and Tara was desolate Mother was dead and with her all the strength and wisdom of the world Nowhere in the world was there anyone to turn to anyone to rely upon And something terrifying was pursuing her and she was running running till her heart was bursting running in a thick swimming fog crying out blindly seeking that nameless unknown haven of safety that was somewhere in the mist about her Rhett was leaning over her when she woke and without a word he picked her up in his arms like a child and held her close his hard muscles comforting his wordless murmuring soothing until her sobbing ceased Oh Rhett I was so cold and so hungry and so tired and I couldnt find it I ran through the mist and I ran but I couldnt find it Find what honey I dont know I wish I did know Is it your old dream Oh yes He gently placed her on the bed fumbled in the darkness and lit a candle In the light his face with bloodshot eyes and harsh lines was as unreadable as stone His shirt opened to the waist showed a brown chest covered with thick black hair Scarlett still shaking with fright thought how strong and unyielding that chest was and she whispered Hold me Rhett Darling he said swiftly and picking her up he sat down in a large chair cradling her body against him Oh Rhett its awful to be hungry It must be awful to dream of starvation after a sevencourse dinner including that enormous crawfish He smiled but his eyes were kind Oh Rhett I just run and run and hunt and I cant ever find what it is Im hunting for Its always hidden in the mist I know if I could find it Id be safe forever and ever and never be cold or hungry again Is it a person or a thing youre hunting I dont know I never thought about it Rhett do you think Ill ever dream that I get there to safety No he said smoothing her tumbled hair I dont Dreams arent like that But I do think that if you get used to being safe and warm and well fed in your everyday life youll stop dreaming that dream And Scarlett Im going to see that you are safe Rhett you are so nice Thanks for the crumbs from your table Mrs Dives Scarlett I want you to say to yourself every morning when you wake up I cant ever be hungry again and nothing can ever touch me so long as Rhett is here and the United States government holds out The United States government she questioned sitting up startled tears still on her cheeks The exConfederate money has now become an honest woman I invested most of it in government bonds Gods nightgown cried Scarlett sitting up in his lap forgetful of her recent terror Do you mean to tell me youve loaned your money to the Yankees At a fair per cent I dont care if its a hundred percent You must sell them immediately The idea of letting the Yankees have the use of your money And what must I do with it he questioned with a smile noting that her eyes were no longer wide with fright Whywhy buy property at Five Points Ill bet you could buy all of Five Points with the money you have Thank you but I wouldnt have Five Points Now that the Carpetbagger government has really gotten control of Georgia theres no telling what may happen I wouldnt put anything beyond the swarm of buzzards thats swooping down on Georgia now from north east south and west Im playing along with them you understand as a good Scalawag should do but I dont trust them And Im not putting my money in real estate I prefer bonds You can hide them You cant hide real estate very easily Do you think she began paling as she thought of the mills and store I dont know But dont look so frightened Scarlett Our charming new governor is a good friend of mine Its just that times are too uncertain now and I dont want much of my money tied up in real estate He shifted her to one knee and leaning back reached for a cigar and lit it She sat with her bare feet dangling watching the play of muscles on his brown chest her terrors forgotten And while we are on the subject of real estate Scarlett he said I am going to build a house You might have bullied Frank into living in Miss Pittys house but not me I dont believe I could bear her vaporings three times a day and moreover I believe Uncle Peter would assassinate me before he would let me live under the sacred Hamilton roof Miss Pitty can get Miss India Wilkes to stay with her and keep the bogyman away When we get back to Atlanta we are going to stay in the bridal suite of the National Hotel until our house is finished Before we left Atlanta I was dickering for that big lot on Peachtree the one near the Leyden house You know the one I mean Oh Rhett how lovely I do so want a house of my own A great big one Then at last we are agreed on something What about a white stucco with wroughtiron work like these Creole houses here Oh no Rhett Not anything old fashioned like these New Orleans houses I know just what I want Its the newest thing because I saw a picture of it inlet me seeit was in that Harpers Weekly I was looking at It was modeled after a Swiss chalet A Swiss what A chalet Spell it She complied Oh he said and stroked his mustache It was lovely It had a high mansard roof with a picket fence on top and a tower made of fancy shingles at each end And the  Page    Gone With The Wind towers had windows with red and blue glass in them It was so stylish looking I suppose it had jigsaw work on the porch banisters Yes And a fringe of wooden scrollwork hanging from the roof of the porch Yes You must have seen one like it I havebut not in Switzerland The Swiss are a very intelligent race and keenly alive to architectural beauty Do you really want a house like that Oh yes I had hoped that association with me might Improve your taste Why not a Creole house or a Colonial with six white columns I tell you I dont want anything tacky and oldfashioned looking And inside lets have red wall paper and red velvet portieres over all the folding doors and oh lots of expensive walnut furniture and grand thick carpets andoh Rhett everybody will be pea green when they see our house It is very necessary that everyone shall be envious Well if you like they shall be green But Scarlett has it occurred to you that its hardly in good taste to furnish the house on so lavish a scale when everyone is so poor I want it that way she said obstinately I want to make everybody whos been mean to me feel bad And well give big receptions thatll make the whole town wish they hadnt said such nasty things But who will come to our receptions Why everybody of course I doubt it The Old Guard dies but it never surrenders Oh Rhett how you run on If youve got money people always like you Not Southerners Its harder for speculators money to get into the best parlors than for the camel to go through the needles eye And as for Scalawagsthats you and me my petwell be lucky if we arent spit upon But if youd like to try Ill back you my dear and Im sure I shall enjoy your campaign intensely And while we are on the subject of money let me make this clear to you You can have all the cash you want for the house and all you want for your fallals And if you like jewelry you can have it but Im going to pick it out You have such execrable taste my pet And anything you want for Wade or Ella And if Will Benteen cant make a go of the cotton Im willing to chip in and help out on that white elephant in Clayton County that you love so much Thats fair enough isnt it Of course Youre very generous But listen closely Not one cent for the store and not one cent for that kindling factory of yours Oh said Scarlett her face falling All during the honeymoon she had been thinking how she could bring up the subject of the thousand dollars she needed to buy fifty feet more of land to enlarge her lumber yard I thought you always bragged about being broad minded and not caring what people said about my running a business and youre just like every other manso afraid people will say I wear the pants in the family Theres never going to be any doubt in anybodys mind about who wears the pants in the Butler family drawled Rhett I dont care what fools say In fact Im ill bred enough to be proud of having a smart wife I want you to keep on running the store and the mills They are your childrens When Wade grows up he wont feel right about being supported by his stepfather and then he can take over the management But not one cent of mine goes into either business Why Because I dont care to contribute to the support of Ashley Wilkes Are you going to begin that again No But you asked my reasons and I have given them And another thing Dont think you can juggle books on me and lie about how much your clothes cost and how much it takes to run the house so that you can use the money to buy more mules or another mill for Ashley I intend to look over and carefully check your expenditures and I know what things cost Oh dont get insulted Youd do it I wouldnt put it beyond you In fact I wouldnt put anything beyond you where either Tara or Ashley is concerned I dont mind Tara But I must draw the line at Ashley Im riding you with a slack rein my pet but dont forget that Im riding with curb and spurs just the same CHAPTER XLIX MRS ELSING cocked her ear toward the hall Hearing Melanies steps die away into the kitchen where rattling dishes and clinking silverware gave promise of refreshments she turned and spoke softly to the ladies who sat in a circle in the parlor their sewing baskets in their laps Personally I do not intend to call on Scarlett now or ever she said the chill elegance of her face colder than usual The other members of the Ladies Sewing Circle for the Widows and Orphans of the Confederacy eagerly laid down their needles and edged their rocking chairs closer All the ladies had been bursting to discuss Scarlett and Rhett but Melanies presence prevented it Just the day before the couple had returned from New Orleans and they were occupying the bridal suite at the National Hotel Hugh says that I must call out of courtesy for the way Captain Butler saved his life Mrs Elsing continued And poor Fanny sides with him and says she will call too I said to her Fanny I said if it wasnt for Scarlett Tommy would be alive this minute It is an insult to his memory to call And Fanny had no better sense than to say Mother Im not calling on Scarlett Im calling on Captain Butler He tried his best to save Tommy and it wasnt his fault if he failed  How silly young people are said Mrs Merriwether Call indeed Her stout bosom swelled indignantly as she remembered Scarletts rude reception of her advice on marrying Rhett My Maybelle is just as silly as your Fanny She says she and Ren will call because Captain Butler kept Ren from getting hanged And I said if it hadnt been for Scarlett exposing herself Ren would  Page    Gone With The Wind never have been in any danger And Father Merriwether intends to call and he talks like he was in his dotage and says hes grateful to that scoundrel even if Im not I vow since Father Merriwether was in that Watling creatures house he has acted in a disgraceful way Call indeed I certainly shant call Scarlett has outlawed herself by marrying such a man He was bad enough when he was a speculator during the war and making money out of our hunger but now that he is hand in glove with the Carpetbaggers and Scalawags and a friendactually a friend of that odious wretch Governor Bullock Call indeed Mrs Bonnell sighed She was a plump brown wren of a woman with a cheerful face Theyll only call once for courtesy Dolly I dont know that I blame them Ive heard that all the men who were out that night intend to call and I think they should Somehow its hard for me to think that Scarlett is her mothers child I went to school with Ellen Robillard in Savannah and there was never a lovelier girl than she was and she was very dear to me If only her father had not opposed her match with her cousin Philippe Robillard There was nothing really wrong with the boyboys must sow their wild oats But Ellen must run off and marry old man OHara and have a daughter like Scarlett But really I feel that I must call once out of memory to Ellen Sentimental nonsense snorted Mrs Merriwether with vigor Kitty Bonnell are you going to call on a woman who married a bare year after her husbands death A woman And she really killed Mr Kennedy interrupted India Her voice was cool but acid Whenever she thought of Scarlett it was hard for her even to be polite remembering always remembering Stuart Tarleton And I have always thought there was more between her and that Butler man before Mr Kennedy was killed than most people suspected Before the ladies could recover from their shocked astonishment at her statement and at a spinster mentioning such a matter Melanie was standing in the doorway So engrossed had they been in their gossip that they had not heard her light tread and now confronted by their hostess they looked like whispering schoolgirls caught by a teacher Alarm was added to consternation at the change in Melanies face She was pink with righteous anger her gentle eyes snapping fire her nostrils quivering No one had ever seen Melanie angry before Not a lady present thought her capable of wrath They all loved her but they thought her the sweetest most pliable of young women deferential to her elders and without any opinions of her own How dare you India she questioned in a low voice that shook Where will your jealousy lead you For shame Indias face went white but her head was high I retract nothing she said briefly But her mind was seething Jealous am I she thought With the memory of Stuart Tarleton and of Honey and Charles didnt she have good reason to be jealous of Scarlett Didnt she have good reason to hate her especially now that she had a suspicion that Scarlett had somehow entangled Ashley in her web She thought Theres plenty I could tell you about Ashley and your precious Scarlett India was torn between the desire to shield Ashley by her silence and to extricate him by telling all her suspicions to Melanie and the whole world That would force Scarlett to release whatever hold she had on Ashley But this was not the time She had nothing definite only suspicions I retract nothing she repeated Then it is fortunate that you are no longer living under my roof said Melanie and her words were cold India leaped to her feet red flooding her sallow face Melanie youmy sisterinlawyou arent going to quarrel with me over that fast piece Scarlett is my sisterinlaw too said Melanie meeting Indias eyes squarely as though they were strangers And dearer to me than any blood sister could ever be If you are so forgetful of my favors at her hands I am not She stayed with me through the whole siege when she could have gone home when even Aunt Pitty had run away to Macon She brought my baby for me when the Yankees were almost in Atlanta and she burdened herself with me and Beau all that dreadful trip to Tara when she could have left me here in a hospital for the Yankees to get me And she nursed and fed me even if she was tired and even if she went hungry Because I was sick and weak I had the best mattress at Tara When I could walk I had the only whole pair of shoes You can forget those things she did for me India but I cannot And when Ashley came home sick discouraged without a home without a cent in his pockets she took him in like a sister And when we thought we would have to go North and it was breaking our hearts to leave Georgia Scarlett stepped in and gave him the mill to run And Captain Butler saved Ashleys life out of the kindness of his heart Certainly Ashley had no claim on him And I am grateful grateful to Scarlett and to Captain Butler But you India How can you forget the favors Scarlett has done me and Ashley How can you hold your brothers life so cheap as to cast slurs on the man who saved him If you went down on your knees to Captain Butler and Scarlett it would not be enough Now Melly began Mrs Merriwether briskly for she had recovered her composure thats no way to talk to India I heard what you said about Scarlett too cried Melanie swinging on the stout old lady with the air of a duelist who having withdrawn a blade from one prostrate opponent turns hungrily toward another And you too Mrs Elsing What you think of her in your own petty minds I do not care for that is your business But what you say about her in my own house or in my own hearing ever is my business But how can you even think such dreadful things much less say them Are your men so cheap to you that you would rather see them dead than alive Have you no gratitude to the man who saved them and saved them at risk of his own life The Yankees might easily have thought him a member of the Klan if the whole truth had come out They might have hanged him But he risked himself for your men For your fatherinlaw Mrs Merriwether and your soninlaw and your two nephews too And your brother Mrs Bonnell and your son and soninlaw Mrs Elsing Ingrates thats what you are I ask an apology from all of you Mrs Elsing was on her feet cramming her sewing into her box her mouth set If anyone had ever told me that you could be so ill bred Melly No I will not apologize India is right Scarlett is a flighty fast bit of baggage I cant forget how she acted during the war And I cant forget how poor white trashy shes acted since she got a little money What you cant forget cut in Melanie clenching her small fists against her sides is that she demoted Hugh because he wasnt smart enough to run her mill Melly moaned a chorus of voices  Page    Gone With The Wind Mrs Elsings head jerked up and she started toward the door With her hand on the knob of the front door she stopped and turned Melly she said and her voice softened honey this breaks my heart I was your mothers best friend and I helped Dr Meade bring you into this world and Ive loved you like you were mine If it were something that mattered it wouldnt be so hard to hear you talk like this But about a woman like Scarlett OHara whod just as soon do you a dirty turn as the next of us Tears had started in Melanies eyes at the first words Mrs Elsing spoke but her face hardened when the old lady had finished I want it understood she said that any of you who do not call on Scarlett need never never call on me There was a loud murmur of voices confusion as the ladies got to their feet Mrs Elsing dropped her sewing box on the floor and came back into the room her false fringe jerking awry I wont have it she cried I wont have it You are beside yourself Melly and I dont hold you responsible You shall be my friend and I shall be yours I refuse to let this come between us She was crying and somehow Melanie was in her arms crying too but declaring between sobs that she meant every word she said Several of the other ladies burst into tears and Mrs Merriwether trumpeting loudly into her handkerchief embraced both Mrs Elsing and Melanie Aunt Pitty who had been a petrified witness to the whole scene suddenly slid to the floor in what was one of the few real fainting spells she had ever had Amid the tears and confusion and kissing and scurrying for smelling salts and brandy there was only one calm face one dry pair of eyes India Wilkes took her departure unnoticed by anyone Grandpa Merriwether meeting Uncle Henry Hamilton in the Girl of the Period Saloon several hours later related the happenings of the morning which he had heard from Mrs Merriwether He told it was relish for he was delighted that someone had the courage to face down his redoubtable daughterinlaw Certainly he had never had such courage Well what did the pack of silly fools finally decide to do asked Uncle Henry irritably I dunno for sure said Grandpa but it looks to me like Melly won hands down on this goround Ill bet theyll all call at least once Folks set a store by that niece of yours Henry Mellys a fool and the ladies are right Scarlett is a slick piece of baggage and I dont see why Charlie ever married her said Uncle Henry gloomily But Melly was right too in a way Its only decent that the families of the men Captain Butler saved should call When you come right down to it I havent got so much against Butler He showed himself a fine man that night he saved our hides Its Scarlett who sticks under my tail like a cocklebur Shes a sight too smart for her own good Well Ive got to call Scalawag or not Scarlett is my niece by marriage after all I was aiming to call this afternoon Ill go with you Henry Dolly will be fit to be tied when she hears Ive gone Wait till I get one more drink No well get a drink off Captain Butler Ill say this for him he always has good licker Rhett had said that the Old Guard would never surrender and he was right He knew how little significance there was to the few calls made upon them and he knew why the calls were made The families of the men who had been in the illstarred Klan foray did call first but called with obvious infrequency thereafter And they did not invite the Rhett Butlers to their homes Rhett said they would not have come at all except for fear of violence at the hands of Melanie Where he got this idea Scarlett did not know but she dismissed it with the contempt it deserved For what possible influence could Melanie have on people like Mrs Elsing and Mrs Merriwether That they did not call again worried her very little in fact their absence was hardly noticed for her suite was crowded with guests of another type New people established Atlantians called them when they were not calling them something less polite There were many new people staying at the National Hotel who like Rhett and Scarlett were waiting for their houses to be completed They were gay wealthy people very much like Rhetts New Orleans friends elegant of dress free with their money vague as to their antecedents All the men were Republicans and were in Atlanta on business connected with the state government Just what the business was Scarlett did not know and did not trouble to learn Rhett could have told her exactly what it wasthe same business that buzzards have with dying animals They smelted death from afar and were drawn unerringly to it to gorge themselves Government of Georgia by its own citizens was dead the state was helpless and the adventurers were swarming in The wives of Rhetts Scalawag and Carpetbagger friends called in droves and so did the new people she had met when she sold lumber for their homes Rhett said that having done business with them she should receive them and having received them she found them pleasant company They wore lovely clothes and never talked about the war or hard times but confined the conversation to fashions scandals and whist Scarlett had never played cards before and she took to whist with joy becoming a good player in a short time Whenever she was at the hotel there was a crowd of whist players in her suite But she was not often in her suite these days for she was too busy with the building of her new house to be bothered with callers These days she did not much care whether she had callers or not She wanted to delay her social activities until the day when the house was finished and she could emerge as the mistress of Atlantas largest mansion the hostess of the towns most elaborate entertainments Through the long warm days she watched her red stone and gray shingle house rise grandly to tower above any other house on Peachtree Street Forgetful of the store and the mills she spent her time on the lot arguing with carpenters bickering with masons harrying the contractor As the walls went swiftly up she thought with satisfaction that when finished it would be larger and finer looking than any other house in town It would be even more imposing than the nearby James residence which had just been purchased for the official mansion of Governor Bullock The governors mansion was brave with jigsaw work on banisters and eaves but the intricate scrollwork on Scarletts house put the mansion to shame The mansion had a ballroom but it looked like a billiard table compared with the enormous room that covered the entire third floor of Scarletts house In fact her house had more of everything than the mansion or any other house in town for that matter more cupolas and turrets and towers and balconies and lightning rods and far more windows with colored panes A veranda encircled the entire house and four flights of steps on the four sides of the building led up to it The yard was wide  Page    Gone With The Wind and green and scattered about it were rustic iron benches an iron summerhouse fashionably called a gazebo which Scarlett had been assured was of pure Gothic design and two large iron statues one a stag and the other a mastiff as large as a Shetland pony To Wade and Ella a little dazzled by the size splendor and fashionable dark gloom of their new home these two metal animals were the only cheerful notes Within the house was furnished as Scarlett had desired with thick red carpeting which ran from wall to wall red velvet portieres and the newest of highly varnished blackwalnut furniture carved wherever there was an inch for carving and upholstered in such slick horsehair that ladies had to deposit themselves thereon with great care for fear of sliding off Everywhere on the walls were giltframed mirrors and long pier glassesas many Rhett said idly as there were in Belle Watlings establishment Interspread were steel engravings in heavy frames some of them eight feet long which Scarlett had ordered especially from New York The walls were covered with rich dark paper the ceilings were high and the house was always dim for the windows were overdraped with plumcolored plush hangings that shut out most of the sunlight All in all it was an establishment to take ones breath away and Scarlett stepping on the soft carpets and sinking into the embrace of the deep feather beds remembered the cold floors and the strawstuffed bedticks of Tara and was satisfied She thought it the most beautiful and most elegantly furnished house she had ever seen but Rhett said it was a nightmare However if it made her happy she was welcome to it A stranger without being told a word about us would know this house was built with illgotten gains he said You know Scarlett money ill come by never comes to good and this house is proof of the axiom Its just the kind of house a profiteer would build But Scarlett abrim with pride and happiness and full of plans for the entertainments she would give when they were thoroughly settled in the house only pinched his ear playfully and said Fiddledeedee How you do run on She knew by now that Rhett loved to take her down a peg and would spoil her fun whenever he could if she lent an attentive ear to his jibes Should she take him seriously she would be forced to quarrel with him and she did not care to match swords for she always came off second best So she hardly ever listened to anything he said and what she was forced to hear she tried to turn off as a joke At least she tried for a while During their honeymoon and for the greater part of their stay at the National Hotel they had lived together with amiability But scarcely had they moved into the new house and Scarlett gathered her new friends about her when sudden sharp quarrels sprang up between them They were brief quarrels short lived because it was impossible to keep a quarrel going with Rhett who remained coolly indifferent to her hot words and waited his chance to pink her in an unguarded spot She quarreled Rhett did not He only stated his unequivocal opinion of herself her actions her house and her new friends And some of his opinions were of such a nature that she could no longer ignore them and treat them as jokes For instance when she decided to change the name of Kennedys General Store to something more edifying she asked him to think of a title that would include the word emporium Rhett suggested Caveat Emptorium assuring her that it would be a title most in keeping with the type of goods sold in the store She thought it had an imposing sound and even went so far as to have the sign painted when Ashley Wilkes embarrassed translated the real meaning And Rhett had roared at her rage And there was the way he treated Mammy Mammy had never yielded an inch from her stand that Rhett was a mule in horse harness She was polite but cold to Rhett She always called him Capn Butler never Mist Rhett She never even dropped a curtsy when Rhett presented her with the red petticoat and she never wore it either She kept Ella and Wade out of Rhetts way whenever she could despite the fact that Wade adored Uncle Rhett and Rhett was obviously fond of the boy But instead of discharging Mammy or being short and stern with her Rhett treated her with the utmost deference with far more courtesy than he treated any of the ladies of Scarletts recent acquaintance In fact with more courtesy than he treated Scarlett herself He always asked Mammys permission to take Wade riding and consulted with her before he bought Ella dolls And Mammy was hardly polite to him Scarlett felt that Rhett should be firm with Mammy as became the head of the house but Rhett only laughed and said that Mammy was the real head of the house He infuriated Scarlett by saying coolly that he was preparing to be very sorry for her some years hence when the Republican rule was gone from Georgia and the Democrats back in power When the Democrats get a governor and a legislature of their own all your new vulgar Republican friends will be wiped off the chess board and sent back to minding bars and emptying slops where they belong And youll be left out on the end of a limb with never a Democratic friend or a Republican either Well take no thought of the morrow Scarlett laughed and with some justice for at that time Bullock was safe in the governors chair twentyseven negroes were in the legislature and thousands of the Democratic voters of Georgia were disfranchised The Democrats will never get back All they do is make Yankees madder and put off the day when they could get back All they do is talk big and run around at night Ku Kluxing They will get back I know Southerners I know Georgians They are a tough and bullheaded lot If theyve got to fight another war to get back theyll fight another war If theyve got to buy black votes like the Yankees have done then they will buy black votes If theyve got to vote ten thousand dead men like the Yankees did every corpse in every cemetery in Georgia will be at the polls Things are going to get so bad under the benign rule of our good friend Rufus Bullock that Georgia is going to vomit him up Rhett dont use such vulgar words cried Scarlett You talk like I wouldnt be glad to see the Democrats come back And you know that isnt so Id be very glad to see them back Do you think I like to see these soldiers hanging around reminding me ofdo you think I like why Im a Georgian too Id like to see the Democrats get back But they wont Not ever And even if they did how would that affect my friends Theyd still have their money wouldnt they If they kept their money But I doubt the ability of any of them to keep money more than five years at the rate theyre spending Easy come easy go Their money wont do them any good Any more than my money has done you any good It certainly hasnt made a horse out of you yet has it my pretty mule  Page    Gone With The Wind The quarrel which sprang from this last remark lasted for days After the fourth day of Scarletts sulks and obvious silent demands for an apology Rhett went to New Orleans taking Wade with him over Mammys protests and he stayed away until Scarletts tantrum had passed But the sting of not humbling him remained with her When he came back from New Orleans cool and bland she swallowed her anger as best she could pushing it into the back of her mind to be thought of at some later date She did not want to bother with anything unpleasant now She wanted to be happy for her mind was full of the first party she would give in the new house It would be an enormous night reception with palms and an orchestra and all the porches shrouded in canvas and a collation that made her mouth water in anticipation To it she intended to invite everyone she had ever known in Atlanta all the old friends and all the new and charming ones she had met since returning from her honeymoon The excitement of the party banished for the most part the memory of Rhetts barbs and she was happy happier than she had been in years as she planned her reception Oh what fun it was to be rich To give parties and never count the cost To buy the most expensive furniture and dresses and food and never think about the bills How marvelous to be able to send tidy checks to Aunt Pauline and Aunt Eulalie in Charleston and to Will at Tara Oh the jealous fools who said money wasnt everything How perverse of Rhett to say that it had done nothing for her Scarlett issued cards of invitation to all her friends and acquaintances old and new even those she did not like She did not except even Mrs Merriwether who had been almost rude when she called on her at the National Hotel or Mrs Elsing who had been cool to frigidness She invited Mrs Meade and Mrs Whiting who she knew disliked her and who she knew would be embarrassed because they did not have the proper clothes to wear to so elegant a function For Scarletts housewarming or crush as it was fashionable to call such evening parties halfreception halfball was by far the most elaborate affair Atlanta had ever seen That night the house and canvascovered veranda were filled with guests who drank her champagne punch and ate her patties and creamed oysters and danced to the music of the orchestra that was carefully screened by a wall of palms and rubber plants But none of those whom Rhett had termed the Old Guard were present except Melanie and Ashley Aunt Pitty and Uncle Henry Dr and Mrs Meade and Grandpa Merriwether Many of the Old Guard had reluctantly decided to attend the crush Some had accepted because of Melanies attitude others because they felt they owed Rhett a debt for saving their lives and those of their relatives But two days before the function a rumor went about Atlanta that Governor Bullock had been invited The Old Guard signified their disapproval by a sheaf of cards regretting their inability to accept Scarletts kind invitation And the small group of old friends who did attend took their departure embarrassed but firm as soon as the governor entered Scarletts house Scarlett was so bewildered and infuriated at these slights that the party was utterly ruined for her Her elegant crush She had planned it so lovingly and so few old friends and no old enemies had been there to see how wonderful it was After the last guest had gone home at dawn she would have cried and stormed had she not been afraid that Rhett would roar with laughter afraid that she would read I told you so in his dancing black eyes even if he did not speak the words So she swallowed her wrath with poor grace and pretended indifference Only to Melanie the next morning did she permit herself the luxury of exploding You insulted me Melly Wilkes and you made Ashley and the others insult me You know theyd have never gone home so soon if you hadnt dragged them Oh I saw you Just when I started to bring Governor Bullock over to present him to you you ran like a rabbit I did not believeI could not believe that he would really be present answered Melanie unhappily Even though everybody said Everybody So everybodys been clacking and blabbing about me have they cried Scarlett furiously Do you mean to tell me if youd known the governor was going to be present you wouldnt have come either No said Melanie in a low voice her eyes on the floor Darling I just wouldnt have come Great balls of fire So youd have insulted me like everybody else did Oh mercy cried Melly in real distress I didnt mean to hurt you Youre my own sister darling my own Charlies widow and I She put a timid hand on Scarletts arm But Scarlett flung it off wishing fervently that she could roar as loudly as Gerald used to roar when in a temper But Melanie faced her wrath And as she looked into Scarletts stormy green eyes her slight shoulders straightened and a mantle of dignity strangely at variance with her childish face and figure fell upon her Im sorry youre hurt my dear but I cannot meet Governor Bullock or any Republican or any Scalawag I will not meet them in your house or any other house No not even if I have toif I have to Melanie cast about her for the worst thing she could think ofNot even if I have to be rude Are you criticizing my friends No dear But they are your friends and not mine Are you criticizing me for having the governor at my house Cornered Melanie still met Scarletts eyes unwaveringly Darling what you do you always do for a good reason and I love you and trust you and it is not for me to criticize And I will not permit anyone to criticize you in my hearing But oh Scarlett Suddenly words began to bubble out swift hot words and there was inflexible hate in the low voice Can you forget what these people did to us Can you forget darling Charlie dead and Ashleys health ruined and Twelve Oaks burned Oh Scarlett you cant forget that terrible man you shot with your mothers sewing box in his hands You cant forget Shermans men at Tara and how they even stole our underwear And tried to burn the place down and actually handled my fathers sword Oh Scarlett it was these same people who robbed us and tortured us and left us to starve that you invited to your party The same people who have set the darkies up to lord it over us who are robbing us and keeping out men from voting I cant forget I wont forget I wont let my Beau forget and Ill teach my grandchildren to hate  Page    Gone With The Wind these peopleand my grandchildrens grandchildren if God lets me live that long Scarlett how can you forget Melanie paused for breath and Scarlett stared at her startled out of her own anger by the quivering note of violence in Melanies voice Do you think Im a fool she questioned impatiently Of course I remember But all thats past Melly Its up to us to make the best of things and Im trying to do it Governor Bullock and some of the nicer Republicans can help us a lot if we handle them right There are no nice Republicans said Melanie flatly And I dont want their help And I dont intend to make the best of thingsif they are Yankee things Good Heaven Melly why get in such a pet Oh cried Melanie looking conscience stricken How I have run on Scarlett I didnt mean to hurt your feelings or to criticize Everybody thinks differently and everybodys got a right to their own opinion Now dear I love you and you know I love you and nothing you could ever do would make me change And you still love me dont you I havent made you hate me have I Scarlett I couldnt stand it if anything ever came between usafter all weve been through together Say its all right Fiddledeedee Melly what a tempest you make in a teapot said Scarlett grudgingly but she did not throw off the hand that stole around her waist Now were all right again said Melanie pleasedly but she added softly I want us to visit each other just like we always did darling Just you let me know what days Republicans and Scalawags are coming to see you and Ill stay at home on those days Its a matter of supreme indifference to me whether you come or not said Scarlett putting on her bonnet and going home in a huff There was some satisfaction to her wounded vanity in the hurt look on Melanies face In the weeks that followed her first party Scarlett was hard put to keep up her pretense of supreme indifference to public opinion When she did not receive calls from old friends except Melanie and Pitty and Uncle Henry and Ashley and did not get cards to their modest entertainments she was genuinely puzzled and hurt Had she not gone out of her way to bury old hatchets and show these people that she bore them no ill will for their gossiping and backbiting Surely they must know that she didnt like Governor Bullock any more than they did but that it was expedient to be nice to him The idiots If everybody would be nice to the Republicans Georgia would get out of the fix she was in very quickly She did not realize then that with one stroke she had cut forever any fragile tie that still bound her to the old days to old friends Not even Melanies influence could repair the break of that gossamer thread And Melanie bewildered broken hearted but still loyal did not try to repair it Even had Scarlett wanted to turn back to old ways old friends there was no turning back possible now The face of the town was set against her as stonily as granite The hate that enveloped the Bullock regime enveloped her too a hate that had little fire and fury in it but much cold implacability Scarlett had cast her lot with the enemy and whatever her birth and family connections she was now in the category of a turncoat a nigger lover a traitor a Republicanand a Scalawag After a miserable while Scarletts pretended indifference gave way to the real thing She had never been one to worry long over the vagaries of human conduct or to be cast down for long if one line of action failed Soon she did not care what the Merriwethers the Elsings the Whitings the Bonnells the Meades and others thought of her At least Melanie called bringing Ashley and Ashley was the one who mattered the most And there were other people in Atlanta who would come to her parties other people far more congenial than those hidebound old hens Any time she wanted to fill her house with guests she could do so and these guests would be far more entertaining far more handsomely dressed than those prissy straitlaced old fools who disapproved of her These people were newcomers to Atlanta Some of them were acquaintances of Rhett some associated with him in those mysterious affairs which he referred to as mere business my pet Some were couples Scarlett had met when she was living at the National Hotel and some were Governor Bullocks appointees The set with which she was now moving was a motley crew Among them were the Gelerts who had lived in a dozen different states and who apparently had left each one hastily upon detection of their swindling schemes the Conningtons whose connection with the Freedmens Bureau in a distant state had been highly lucrative at the expense of the ignorant blacks they were supposed to protect the Deals who had sold cardboard shoes to the Confederate government until it became necessary for them to spend the last year of the war in Europe the Hundons who had police records in many cities but nevertheless were often successful bidders on state contracts the Carahans who had gotten their start in a gambling house and now were gambling for bigger stakes in the building of nonexistent railroads with the states money the Flahertys who had bought salt at one cent a pound in  and made a fortune when salt went to fifty cents in  and the Barts who had owned the largest brothel in a Northern metropolis during the war and now were moving in the best circles of Carpetbagger society Such people were Scarletts intimates now but those who attended her larger receptions included others of some culture and refinement many of excellent families In addition to the Carpetbag gentry substantial people from the North were moving into Atlanta attracted by the never ceasing business activity of the town in this period of rebuilding and expansion Yankee families of wealth sent young sons to the South to pioneer on the new frontier and Yankee officers after their discharge took up permanent residence in the town they had fought so hard to capture At first strangers in a strange town they were glad to accept invitations to the lavish entertainments of the wealthy and hospitable Mrs Butler but they soon drifted out of her set They were good people and they needed only a short acquaintance with Carpetbaggers and Carpetbag rule to become as resentful of them as the native Georgians were Many became Democrats and more Southern than the Southerners Other misfits in Scarletts circle remained there only because they were not welcome elsewhere They would have much preferred the quiet parlors of the Old Guard but the Old Guard would have none of them Among these were the Yankee schoolmarms who had come South imbued with the desire to uplift the Negro and the Scalawags who had been born good Democrats but had turned Republican after the surrender It was hard to say which class was more cordially hated by the settled citizenry the impractical Yankee schoolmarms or the Scalawags but the balance probably fell with the latter The schoolmarms could be dismissed with Well what can you expect  Page    Gone With The Wind of niggerloving Yankees Of course they think the nigger is just as good as they are But for those Georgians who had turned Republican for personal gain there was no excuse Starving is good enough for us It ought to be good enough for you was the way the Old Guard felt Many exConfederate soldiers knowing the frantic fear of men who saw their families in want were more tolerant of former comrades who had changed political colors in order that their families might eat But not the women of the Old Guard and the women were the implacable and inflexible power behind the social throne The Lost Cause was stronger dearer now in their hearts than it had ever been at the height of its glory It was a fetish now Everything about it was sacred the graves of the men who had died for it the battle fields the torn flags the crossed sabres in their halls the fading letters from the front the veterans These women gave no aid comfort or quarter to the late enemy and now Scarlett was numbered among the enemy In this mongrel society thrown together by the exigencies of the political situation there was but one thing in common That was money As most of them had never had twentyfive dollars at one time in their whole lives previous to the war they were now embarked on an orgy of spending such as Atlanta had never seen before With the Republicans in the political saddle the town entered into an era of waste and ostentation with the trappings of refinement thinly veneering the vice and vulgarity beneath Never before had the cleavage of the very rich and the very poor been so marked Those on top took no thought for those less fortunate Except for the negroes of course They must have the very best The best of schools and lodgings and clothes and amusements for they were the power in politics and every negro vote counted But as for the recently impoverished Atlanta people they could starve and drop in the streets for all the newly rich Republicans cared On the crest of this wave of vulgarity Scarlett rode triumphantly newly a bride dashingly pretty in her fine clothes with Rhetts money solidly behind her It was an era that suited her crude garish showy full of overdressed women overfurnished houses too many jewels too many horses too much food too much whisky When Scarlett infrequently stopped to think about the matter she knew that none of her new associates could be called ladies by Ellens strict standards But she had broken with Ellens standards too many times since that faraway day when she stood in the parlor at Tara and decided to be Rhetts mistress and she did not often feel the bite of conscience now Perhaps these new friends were not strictly speaking ladies and gentlemen but like Rhetts New Orleans friends they were so much fun So very much more fun than the subdued churchgoing Shakespearereading friends of her earlier Atlanta days And except for her brief honeymoon interlude she had not had fun in so long Nor had she had any sense of security Now secure she wanted to dance to play to riot to gorge on foods and fine wine to deck herself in silks and satins to wallow on soft feather beds and fine upholstery And she did all these things Encouraged by Rhetts amused tolerance freed now from the restraints of her childhood freed even from that last fear of poverty she was permitting herself the luxury she had often dreamedof doing exactly what she pleased and telling people who didnt like it to go to hell To her had come that pleasant intoxication peculiar to those whose lives are a deliberate slap in the face of organized societythe gambler the confidence man the polite adventuress an those who succeed by their wits She said and did exactly what she pleased and in practically no time her insolence knew no bounds She did not hesitate to display arrogance to her new Republican and Scalawag friends but to no class was she ruder or more insolent than the Yankee officers of the garrison and their families Of all the heterogeneous mass of people who had poured into Atlanta the army people alone she refused to receive or tolerate She even went out of her way to be bad mannered to them Melanie was not alone in being unable to forget what a blue uniform meant To Scarlett that uniform and those gold buttons would always mean the fears of the siege the terror of flight the looting and burning the desperate poverty and the grinding work at Tara Now that she was rich and secure in the friendship of the governor and many prominent Republicans she could be insulting to every blue uniform she saw And she was insulting Rhett once lazily pointed out to her that most of the male guests who assembled under their roof had worn that same blue uniform not so long ago but she retorted that a Yankee didnt seem like a Yankee unless he had on a blue uniform To which Rhett replied Consistency thou art a jewel and shrugged Scarlett hating the bright hard blue they wore enjoyed snubbing them all the more because it so bewildered them The garrison families had a right to be bewildered for most of them were quiet wellbred folk lonely in a hostile land anxious to go home to the North a little ashamed of the riffraff whose rule they were forced to upholdan infinitely better class than that of Scarletts associates Naturally the officers wives were puzzled that the dashing Mrs Butler took to her bosom such women as the common redhaired Bridget Flaherty and went out of her way to slight them But even the ladies whom Scarlett took to her bosom had to endure much from her However they did it gladly To them she not only represented wealth and elegance but the old regime with its old names old families old traditions with which they wished ardently to identify themselves The old families they yearned after might have cast Scarlett out but the ladies of the new aristocracy did not know it They only knew that Scarletts father had been a great slave owner her mother a Robillard of Savannah and her husband was Rhett Butler of Charleston And this was enough for them She was their opening wedge into the old society they wished to enter the society which scorned them would not return calls and bowed frigidly in churches In fact she was more than their wedge into society To them fresh from obscure beginnings she was society Pinchbeck ladies themselves they no more saw through Scarletts pinchbeck pretensions than she herself did They took her at her own valuation and endured much at her hands her airs her graces her tempers her arrogance her downright rudeness and her frankness about their shortcomings They were so lately come from nothing and so uncertain of themselves they were doubly anxious to appear refined and feared to show their temper or make retorts in kind lest they be considered unladylike At all costs they must be ladies They pretended to great delicacy modesty and innocence To hear them talk one would have thought they had no legs natural functions or knowledge of the wicked world No one would have thought that redhaired Bridget Flaherty who had a sundefying white skin and a brogue that could be cut with a butter knife had stolen her fathers hidden hoard to come to America to be chambermaid in a New York hotel And to observe the delicate vapors of Sylvia formerly Sadie Belle Connington and Mamie Bart no one  Page    Gone With The Wind would have suspected that the first grew up above her fathers saloon in the Bowery and waited on the bar at rush times and that the latter so it was said had come out of one of her husbands own brothels No they were delicate sheltered creatures now The men though they had made money learned new ways less easily or were perhaps less patient with the demands of the new gentility They drank heavily at Scarletts parties far too heavily and usually after a reception there were one or more unexpected guests who stayed the night They did not drink like the men of Scarletts girlhood They became sodden stupid ugly or obscene Moreover no matter how many spittoons she might put out in view the rugs always showed signs of tobacco juice on the mornings after She had a contempt for these people but she enjoyed them Because she enjoyed them she filled the house with them And because of her contempt she told them to go to hell as often as they annoyed her But they stood it They even stood Rhett a more difficult matter for Rhett saw through them and they knew it He had no hesitation about stripping them verbally even under his own roof always in a manner that left them no reply Unashamed of how he came by his fortune he pretended that they too were unashamed of their beginnings and he seldom missed an opportunity to remark upon matters which by common consent everyone felt were better left in polite obscurity There was never any knowing when be would remark affably over a punch cup Ralph if Id had any sense Id have made my money selling goldmine stocks to widows and orphans like you instead of blockading Its so much safer Well Bill I see you have a new span of horses Been selling a few thousand more bonds for nonexistent railroads Good work boy Congratulations Amos on landing that state contract Too bad you had to grease so many palms to get it The ladies felt that he was odiously unendurably vulgar The men said behind his back that he was a swine and a bastard New Atlanta liked Rhett no better than old Atlanta had done and he made as little attempt to conciliate the one as he had the other He went his way amused contemptuous impervious to the opinions of those about him so courteous that his courtesy was an affront in itself To Scarlett he was still an enigma but an enigma about which she no longer bothered her head She was convinced that nothing ever pleased him or ever would please him that he either wanted something badly and didnt have it or never had wanted anything and so didnt care about anything He laughed at everything she did encouraged her extravagances and insolences jeered at her pretensesand paid the bills CHAPTER L RHETT NEVER DEVIATED from his smooth imperturbable manners even in their most intimate moments But Scarlett never lost the old feeling that he was watching her covertly knew that if she turned her head suddenly she would surprise in his eyes that speculative waiting look that look of almost terrible patience that she did not understand Sometimes he was a very comfortable person to live with for all his unfortunate habit of not permitting anyone in his presence to act a lie palm off a pretense or indulge in bombast He listened to her talk of the store and the mills and the saloon the convicts and the cost of feeding them and gave shrewd hardheaded advice He had untiring energy for the dancing and parties she loved and an unending supply of coarse stories with which he regaled her on their infrequent evenings alone when the table was cleared and brandy and coffee before them She found that he would give her anything she desired answer any question she asked as long as she was forthright and refuse her anything she attempted to gain by indirection hints and feminine angling He had a disconcerting habit of seeing through her and laughing rudely Contemplating the suave indifference with which he generally treated her Scarlett frequently wondered but with no real curiosity why he had married her Men married for love or a home and children or money but she knew he had married her for none of these things He certainly did not love her He referred to her lovely house as an architectural horror and said he would rather live in a wellregulated hotel than a home And he never once hinted about children as Charles and Frank had done Once when trying to coquet with him she asked why he married her and was infuriated when he replied with an amused gleam in his eyes I married you to keep you for a pet my dear No he hadnt married her for any of the usual reasons men marry women He had married her solely because he wanted her and couldnt get her any other way He had admitted as much the night he proposed to her He had wanted her just as he had wanted Belle Watling This was not a pleasant thought In fact it was a barefaced insult But she shrugged it off as she had learned to shrug off all unpleasant facts They had made a bargain and she was quite pleased with her side of the bargain She hoped he was equally pleased but she did not care very much whether he was or not But one afternoon when she was consulting Dr Meade about a digestive upset she learned an unpleasant fact which she could not shrug off It was with real hate in her eyes that she stormed into her bedroom at twilight and told Rhett that she was going to have a baby He was lounging in a silk dressing gown in a cloud of smoke and his eyes went sharply to her face as she spoke But he said nothing He watched her in silence but there was a tenseness about his pose as he waited for her next words that was lost on her Indignation and despair had claimed her to the exclusion of all other thoughts You know I dont want any more children I never wanted any at all Every time things are going right with me I have to have a baby Oh dont sit there and laugh You dont want it either Oh Mother of God If he was waiting for words from her these were not the words he wanted His face hardened slightly and his eyes became blank Well why not give it to Miss Melly Didnt you tell me she was so misguided as to want another baby Oh I could kill you I wont have it I tell you I wont No Pray continue Oh there are things to do Im not the stupid country fool I used to be Now I know that a woman doesnt have to have children if she doesnt want them There are things He was on his feet and had her by the wrist and there was a hard driving fear in his face Scarlett you fool tell me the truth You havent done anything  Page    Gone With The Wind No I havent but Im going to Do you think Im going to have my figure ruined all over again just when Ive gotten my waist line down and am having a good time Where did you get this idea Whos been telling you things Mamie Bartshe The madam of a whore house would know such tricks That woman never puts foot in this house again do you understand After all it is my house and Im the master of it I do not even want you to speak to her again Ill do as I please Turn me loose Why should you care I dont care whether you have one child or twenty but I do care if you die Die Me Yes die I dont suppose Mamie Bart told you the chances a woman takes when she does a thing like that No said Scarlett reluctantly She just said it would fix things up fine By God I will kill her cried Rhett and his face was black with rage He looked down into Scarletts tearstained face and some of the wrath faded but it was still hard and set Suddenly he picked her up in his arms and sat down in the chair holding her close to him tightly as if he feared she would get away from him Listen my baby I wont have you take your life in your hands Do you hear Good God I dont want children any more than you do but I can support them I dont want to hear any more foolishness out of you and if you dare try toScarlett I saw a girl die that way once She was only awell but she was a pretty sort at that Its not an easy way to die I Why Rhett she cried startled out of her misery at the emotion in his voice She had never seen him so moved Wherewho In New Orleansoh years ago I was young and impressionable He bent his head suddenly and buried his lips in her hair Youll have your baby Scarlett if I have to handcuff you to my wrist for the next nine months She sat up in his lap and stared into his face with frank curiosity Under her gaze it was suddenly smooth and bland as though wiped clear by magic His eyebrows were up and the corner of his mouth was down Do I mean so much to you she questioned dropping her eyelids He gave her a level look as though estimating how much coquetry was behind the question Reading the true meaning of her demeanor he made casual answer Well yes You see Ive invested a good deal of money in you and Id hate to lose it  Melanie came out of Scarletts room weary from the strain but happy to tears at the birth of Scarletts daughter Rhett stood tensely in the hall surrounded by cigar butts which had burned holes in the fine carpet You can go in now Captain Butler she said shyly Rhett went swiftly past her into the room and Melanie had a brief glimpse of him bending over the small naked baby in Mammys lap before Dr Meade shut the door Melanie sank into a chair her face pinkening with embarrassment that she had unintentionally witnessed so intimate a scene Ah she thought How sweet How worried poor Captain Butler has been And he did not take a single drink all this time How nice of him So many gentlemen are so intoxicated by the time their babies are born I fear he needs a drink badly Dare I suggest it No that would be very forward of me She sank gratefully into a chair her back which always ached these days feeling as though it would break in two at the waist line Oh how fortunate Scarlett was to have Captain Butler just outside her door while the baby was being born If only she had had Ashley with her that dreadful day Beau came she would not have suffered half so much If only that small girl behind those closed doors were hers and not Scarletts Oh how wicked I am she thought guiltily I am coveting her baby and Scarlett has been so good to me Forgive me Lord I wouldnt really want Scarletts baby butbut I would so like a baby of my own She pushed a small cushion behind her aching back and thought hungrily of a daughter of her own But Dr Meade had never changed his opinion on that subject And though she was quite willing to risk her life for another child Ashley would not hear of it A daughter How Ashley would love a daughter A daughter Mercy She sat up in alarm I never told Captain Butler it was a girl And of course he was expecting a boy Oh how dreadful Melanie knew that to a woman a child of either sex was equally welcome but to a man and especially such a selfwilled man as Captain Butler a girl would be a blow a reflection upon his manhood Oh how thankful she was that God had permitted her only child to be a boy She knew that had she been the wife of the fearsome Captain Butler she would have thankfully died in childbirth rather than present him with a daughter as his firstborn But Mammy waddling grinning from the room set her mind at easeand at the same time made her wonder just what kind of man Captain Butler really was Wen Ah wuz bathin dat chile jes now said Mammy Ah kinder pologized ter Mist Rhett bout it not bein a boy But Lawd Miss Melly you know whut he say He say Hesh yo mouf Mammy Who want a boy Boys ain no fun Deys jes a passel of trouble Gals is whut is fun Ah wouldn swap disyere gal fer a bakers dozen of boys Den he try ter snatch de chile frum me buck nekked as she wuz an Ah slap his wrist an say

Ain Ah a proof of dat Yasm Miss Melly he ack lak a gempmum bout it finished Mammy graciously It was not lost on Melanie that Rhetts conduct had gone far toward redeeming him in Mammys eyes Maybe Ah done been a mite wrong bout Mist Rhett Dis sho is a happy day ter me Miss Melly Ah done diapered three ginrations of Robillard gals an it sho is a happy day Oh yes it is a happy day Mammy The happiest days are the days when babies come To one person in the house it was not a happy day Scolded and for the most part ignored Wade Hampton idled miserably  Page    Gone With The Wind about the dining room Early that morning Mammy had waked him abruptly dressed him hurriedly and sent him with Ella to Aunt Pittys house for breakfast The only explanation he received was that his mother was sick and the noise of his playing might upset her Aunt Pittys house was in an uproar for the news of Scarletts sickness had sent the old lady to bed in a state with Cookie in attendance and breakfast was a scant meal that Peter concocted for the children As the morning wore on fear began to possess Wades soul Suppose Mother died Other boys mothers had died He had seen the hearses move away from the house and heard his small friends sobbing Suppose Mother should die Wade loved his mother very much almost as much as he feared her and the thought of her being carried away in a black hearse behind black horses with plumes on their bridles made his small chest ache so that he could hardly breathe When noon came and Peter was busy in the kitchen Wade slipped out the front door and hurried home as fast as his short legs could carry him fear speeding him Uncle Rhett or Aunt Melly or Mammy surely would tell him the truth But Uncle Rhett and Aunt Melly were not to be seen and Mammy and Dilcey sped up and down the back stairs with towels and basins of hot water and did not once notice him in the front hall From upstairs he could hear occasionally the curt tones of Dr Meade whenever a door opened Once he heard his mother groan and he burst into sobbing hiccoughs He knew she was going to die For comfort he made overtures to the honeycolored cat which lay on the sunny window sill in the front hall But Tom full of years and irritable at disturbances switched his tail and spat softly Finally Mammy coming down the front stairs her apron rumpled and spotted her head rag awry saw him and scowled Mammy had always been Wades mainstay and her frown made him tremble You is de wustes boy Ah ever seed she said Ain Ah done sont you ter Miss Pittys Gwan back dar Is Mother going towill she die You is de troublesomes chile Ah ever seed Die Gawdlmighty no Lawd boys is a tawment Ah doan see why de Lawd sens boys ter folks Now gwan way from here But Wade did not go He retreated behind the portieres in the hall only half convinced by her words The remark about the troublesomeness of boys stung for he had always tried his best to be good Aunt Melly hurried down the stairs half an hour later pale and tired but smiling to herself She looked thunderstruck when she saw his woebegone face in the shadows of the drapery Usually Aunt Melly had all the time in the world to give him She never said as Mother so often did Dont bother me now Im in a hurry or Run away Wade I am busy But this morning she said Wade youve been very naughty Why didnt you stay at Aunt Pittys Is Mother going to die Gracious no Wade Dont be a silly child and then relenting Dr Meade has just brought her a nice little baby a sweet little sister for you to play with and if you are real good you can see her tonight Now run out and play and dont make any noise Wade slipped into the quiet dining room his small and insecure world tottering Was there no place for a worried little sevenyearold boy on this sunshiny day when the grownups acted so curiously He sat down on the window still in the alcove and nibbled a bit of the elephants ear which grew in a box in the sun It was so peppery that it stung his eyes to tears and he began to cry Mother was probably dying nobody paid him any heed and one and all they rushed about because of a new babya girl baby Wade had little interest in babies still less in girls The only little girl he knew intimately was Ella and so far she had done nothing to command his respect or liking After a long interval Dr Meade and Uncle Rhett came down the stairs and stood talking in the hall in low voices After the door shut behind the doctor Uncle Rhett came swiftly into the dining room and poured himself a large drink from the decanter before he saw Wade Wade shrank back expecting to be told again that he was naughty and must return to Aunt Pittys but instead Un cle Rhett smiled Wade had never seen him smile like that or look so happy and encouraged he leaped from the sill and ran to him Youve got a sister said Rhett squeezing him By God the most beautiful baby you ever saw Now why are you crying Mother Your mothers eating a great big dinner chicken and rice and gravy and coffee and were going to make her some ice cream in a little while and you can have two plates if you want them And Ill show you your sister too Weak with relief Wade tried to be polite about his new sister but failed Everyone was interested in this girl No one cared anything about him any more not even Aunt Melly or Uncle Rhett Uncle Rhett he began do people like girls better than boys Rhett set down his glass and looked sharply into the small face and instant comprehension came into his eyes No I cant say they do he answered seriously as though giving the matter due thought Its just that girls are more trouble than boys and people are apt to worry more about troublesome people than those who arent Mammy just said boys were troublesome Well Mammy was upset She didnt mean it Uncle Rhett wouldnt you rather have had a little boy than a little girl questioned Wade hopefully No answered Rhett swiftly and seeing the boys face fall he continued Now why should I want a boy when Ive already got one You have cried Wade his month falling open at this information Where is he Right here answered Rhett and picking the child up drew him to his knee You are boy enough for me son For a moment the security and happiness of being wanted was so great that Wade almost cried again His throat worked and he ducked his head against Rhetts waistcoat You are my boy arent you Can you bewell two mens boy questioned Wade loyalty to the father he had never known struggling with love for the man who held him so understandingly Yes said Rhett firmly Just like you can be your mothers boy and Aunt Mellys too  Page    Gone With The Wind Wade digested this statement It made sense to him and he smiled and wriggled against Rhetts arm shyly You understand little boys dont you Uncle Rhett Rhetts dark face fell into its old harsh lines and his lip twisted Yes he said bitterly I understand little boys For a moment fear came back to Wade fear and a sudden sense of jealousy Uncle Rhett was not thinking of him but of some one else You havent got any other began Wade and then Rhett set him on his feet Im going to have a drink and so are you Wade your first drink a toast to your new sister You havent got any other began Wade and then seeing Rhett reach for the decanter of claret the excitement at being included in this grownup ceremony diverted him Oh I cant Uncle Rhett I promised Aunt Melly I wouldnt drink till I graduated from the university and shes going to give me a watch if I dont And Ill give you a chain for itthis one Im wearing now if you want it said Rhett and he was smiling again Aunt Mellys quite right But she was talking about spirits not wine You must learn to drink wine like a gentleman son and theres no time like the present to learn Skillfully he diluted the claret with water from the carafe until the liquid was barely pink and handed the glass to Wade At that moment Mammy entered the dining room She had changed to her best Sunday black and her apron and head rag were fresh and crisp As she waddled she switched herself and from her skirts came the whisper and rustle of silk The worried look had gone from her face and her almost toothless gums showed in a wide smile Burfday gif Mist Rhett she said Wade stopped with his glass at his lips He knew Mammy had never liked his stepfather He had never heard her call him anything except Capn Butler and her conduct toward him had been dignified but cold And here she was beaming and sidling and calling him Mist Rhett What a topsyturvy day Youd rather have rum than claret I suppose said Rhett reaching into the cellaret and producing a squat bottle She is a beautiful baby isnt she Mammy She sho is answered Mammy smacking her lips as she took the glass Did you ever see a prettier one Well suh Miss Scarlett wuz mout nigh as pretty wen she come but not quite Have another glass Mammy And Mammy his tone was stern but his eyes twinkled whats that rustling noise I hear Lawd Mist Rhett dat ain nuthin but mah red silk petticoat Mammy giggled and switched till her huge bulk shook Nothing but your petticoat I dont believe it You sound like a peck of dried leaves rubbing together Let me see Pull up your skirt Mist Rhett you is bad YeahO Lawd Mammy gave a little shriek and retreated and from a distance of a yard modestly elevated her dress a few inches and showed the ruffle of a red taffeta petticoat You took long enough about wearing it grumbled Rhett but his black eyes laughed and danced Yassuh too long Then Rhett said something that Wade did not understand No more mule in horse harness Mist Rhett Miss Scarlett wuz bad ter tell you dat You ain holin dat again dis ole nigger No Im not holding it I just wanted to know Have another drink Mammy Have the whole bottle Drink up Wade Give us a toast To Sissy cried Wade and gulped the liquid down Choking he began to cough and hiccough and the other two laughed and beat him on the back From the moment his daughter was born Rhetts conduct was puzzling to all observers and he upset many settled notions about himself notions which both the town and Scarlett were loath to surrender Whoever would have thought that he of all people would be so shamelessly so openly proud of fatherhood Especially in view of the embarrassing circumstance that his firstborn was a girl and not a boy The novelty of fatherhood did not wear off This caused some secret envy among women whose husbands took offspring for granted long before the children were christened He buttonholed people on the street and related details of his childs miraculous progress without even prefacing his remarks with the hypocritical but polite I know everyone thinks their own child is smart but He thought his daughter marvelous not to be compared with lesser brats and he did not care who knew it When the new nurse permitted the baby to suck a bit of fat pork thereby bringing on the first attack of colic Rhetts conduct sent seasoned fathers and mothers into gales of laughter He hurriedly summoned Dr Meade and two other doctors and with difficulty he was restrained from beating the unfortunate nurse with his crop The nurse was discharged and thereafter followed a series of nurses who remained at the most a week None of them was good enough to satisfy the exacting requirements Rhett laid down Mammy likewise viewed with displeasure the nurses that came and went for she was jealous of any strange negro and saw no reason why she could not care for the baby and Wade and Ella too But Mammy was showing her age and rheumatism was slowing her lumbering tread Rhett lacked the courage to cite these reasons for employing another nurse He told her instead that a man of his position could not afford to have only one nurse It did not look well He would hire two others to do the drudgery and leave her as Mammyinchief This Mammy understood very well More servants were a credit to her position as well as Rhetts But she would not she told him firmly have any trashy free issue niggers in her nursery So Rhett sent to Tara for Prissy He knew her shortcomings but after all she was a family darky And Uncle Peter produced a greatniece named Lou who had  Page    Gone With The Wind belonged to one of Miss Pittys Burr cousins Even before Scarlett was able to be about again she noticed Rhetts preoccupation with the baby and was somewhat nettled and embarrassed at his pride in her in front of callers It was all very well for a man to love his child but she felt there was something unmanly in the display of such love He should be offhand and careless as other men were You are making a fool of yourself she said irritably and I dont see why No Well you wouldnt The reason is that shes the first person whos ever belonged utterly to me She belongs to me too No you have two other children Shes mine Great balls of fire said Scarlett I had the baby didnt I Besides honey I belong to you Rhett looked at her over the black head of the child and smiled oddly Do you my dear Only the entrance of Melanie stopped one of those swift hot quarrels which seemed to spring up so easily between them these days Scarlett swallowed her wrath and watched Melanie take the baby The name agreed upon for the child was Eugenic Victoria but that afternoon Melanie unwittingly bestowed a name that clung even as Pittypat had blotted out all memory of Sarah Jane Rhett leaning over the child had said Her eyes are going to be pea green Indeed they are not cried Melanie indignantly forgetting that Scarletts eyes were almost that shade They are going to be blue like Mr OHaras eyes as blue asas blue as the bonnie blue flag Bonnie Blue Butler laughed Rhett taking the child from her and peering more closely into the small eyes And Bonnie she became until even her parents did not recall that she had been named for two queens CHAPTER LI WHEN SHE WAS FINALLY able to go out again Scarlett had Lou lace her into stays as tightly as the strings would pull Then she passed the tape measure about her waist Twenty inches She groaned aloud That was what having babies did to your figure Her waist was a large as Aunt Pittys as large as Mammys Pull them tighter Lou See if you cant make it eighteen and a half inches or I cant get into any of my dresses Itll bust de strings said Lou Yo wais jes done got bigger Miss Scarlett an dar ain nuthin ter do bout it There is something to do about it thought Scarlett as she ripped savagely at the seams of her dress to let out the necessary inches I just wont have any more babies Of course Bonnie was pretty and a credit to her and Rhett adored the child but she would not have another baby Just how she would manage this she did not know for she couldnt handle Rhett as she had Frank Rhett wasnt afraid of her It would probably be difficult with Rhett acting so foolishly about Bonnie and probably wanting a son next year for all that he said hed drown any boy she gave him Well she wouldnt give him a boy or girl either Three children were enough for any woman to have When Lou had stitched up the ripped seams pressed them smooth and buttoned Scarlett into the dress she called the carriage and Scarlett set out for the lumber yard Her spirits rose as she went and she forgot about her waist line for she was going to meet Ashley at the yard to go over the books with him And if she was lucky she might see him alone She hadnt seen him since long before Bonnie was born She hadnt wanted to see him at all when she was so obviously pregnant And she had missed the daily contact with him even if there was always someone around She had missed the importance and activity of her lumber business while she was immured Of course she did not have to work now She could easily sell the mills and invest the money for Wade and Ella But that would mean she would hardly ever see Ashley except in a formal social way with crowds of people around And working by Ashleys side was her greatest pleasure When she drove up to the yard she saw with interest how high the piles of lumber were and how many customers were standing among them talking to Hugh Elsing And there were six mule teams and wagons being loaded by the negro drivers Six teams she thought with pride And I did all this by myself Ashley came to the door of the little office his eyes joyful with the pleasure of seeing her again and he handed her out of her carriage and into the office as if she were a queen But some of her pleasure was dimmed when she went over the books of his null and compared them with Johnnie Galleghers books Ashley had barely made expenses and Johnnie had a remarkable sum to his credit She forbore to say anything as she looked at the two sheets but Ashley read her face Scarlett Im sorry All I can say is that I wish youd let me hire free darkies instead of using convicts I believe I could do better Darkies Why their pay would break us Convicts are dirt cheap If Johnnie can make this much with them Ashleys eyes went over her shoulder looking at something she could not see and the glad light went out of his eyes I cant work convicts like Johnnie Gallegher I cant drive men Gods nightgown Johnnies a wonder at it Ashley you are just too soft hearted You ought to get more work out of them Johnnie told me that any time a malingerer wanted to get out of work he told you he was sick and you gave him a day off Good Lord Ashley Thats no way to make money A couple of licks will cure most any sickness short of a broken leg Scarlett Scarlett Stop I cant bear to hear you talk that way cried Ashley his eyes coming back to her with a fierceness that stopped her short Dont you realize that they are mensome of them sick underfed miserable and Oh my dear I cant bear to see the way he has brutalized you you who were always so sweet Who has whatted me Ive got to say it and I havent any right But Ive got to say it YourRhett Butler Everything he touches he poisons And he has taken you who were so sweet and generous and gentle for all your spirited ways and he has done this to youhardened you brutalized you by his contact  Page    Gone With The Wind Oh breathed Scarlett guilt struggling with joy that Ashley should feel so deeply about her should still think her sweet Thank God he thought Rhett to blame for her pennypinching ways Of course Rhett had nothing to do with it and the guilt was hers but after all another black mark on Rhett could do him no harm If it were any other man in the world I wouldnt care so muchbut Rhett Butler Ive seen what hes done to you Without your realizing it hes twisted your thoughts into the same hard path his own run in Oh yes I know I shouldnt say this He saved my life and I am grateful but I wish to God it had been any other man but him And I havent the right to talk to you like Oh Ashley you have the rightno one else has I tell you I cant bear it seeing your fineness coarsened by him knowing that your beauty and your charm are in the keeping of a man who When I think of him touching you I Hes going to kiss me thought Scarlett ecstatically And it wont be my fault She swayed toward him But he drew back suddenly as if realizing he had said too muchsaid things he never intended to say I apologize most humbly Scarlett IIve been insinuating that your husband is not a gentleman and my own words have proved that Im not one No one has a right to criticize a husband to a wife I havent any excuse exceptexcept He faltered and his face twisted She waited breathless I havent any excuse at all All the way home in the carriage Scarletts mind raced No excuse at all exceptexcept that he loved her And the thought of her lying in Rhetts arms roused a fury in him that she did not think possible Well she could understand that If it wasnt for the knowledge that his relations with Melanie were necessarily those of brother and sister her own life would be a torment And Rhetts embraces coarsened her brutalized her Well if Ashley thought that she could do very well without those embraces She thought how sweet and romantic it would be for them both to be physically true to each other even though married to other people The idea possessed her imagination and she took pleasure in it And then too there was the practical side of it It would mean that she would not have to have any more children When she reached home and dismissed the carriage some of the exaltation which had filled her at Ashleys words began to fade as she faced the prospect of telling Rhett that she wanted separate bedrooms and all which that implied It would be difficult Moreover how could she tell Ashley that she had denied herself to Rhett because of his wishes What earthly good was a sacrifice if no one knew about it What a burden modesty and delicacy were If she could only talk to Ashley as frankly as she could to Rhett Well no matter Shed insinuate the truth to Ashley somehow She went up the stairs and opening the nursery door found Rhett sitting beside Bonnies crib with Ella upon his lap and Wade displaying the contents of his pocket to him What a blessing Rhett liked children and made much of them Some stepfathers were so bitter about children of former marriages I want to talk to you she said and passed on into their bedroom Better have this over now while her determination not to have any more children was hot within her and while Ashleys love was giving her strength Rhett she said abruptly when he had closed the bedroom door behind him Ive decided that I dont want any more children If he was startled at her unexpected statement he did not show it He lounged to a chair and sitting down tilted it back My pet as I told you before Bonnie was born it is immaterial to me whether you have one child or twenty How perverse of him to evade the issue so neatly as if not caring whether children came had anything to do with their actual arrival I think three are enough I dont intend to have one every year Three seems an adequate number You know very well she began embarrassment making her cheeks red You know what I mean I do Do you realize that I can divorce you for refusing me my marital rights You are just low enough to think of something like that she cried annoyed that nothing was going as she planned it If you had any chivalry youdyoud be nice like Well look at Ashley Wilkes Melanie cant have any children and he Quite the little gentleman Ashley said Rhett and his eyes began to gleam oddly Pray go on with your discourse Scarlett choked for her discourse was at its end and she had nothing more to say Now she saw how foolish had been her hope of amicably settling so important a matter especially with a selfish swine like Rhett Youve been to the lumber office this afternoon havent you What has that to do with it You like dogs dont you Scarlett Do you prefer them in kennels or mangers The allusion was lost on her as the tide of her anger and disappointment rose He got lightly to his feet and coming to her put his hand under her chin and jerked her face up to his What a child you are You have lived with three men and still know nothing of mens natures You seem to think they are like old ladies past the change of life He pinched her chin playfully and his hand dropped away from her One black eyebrow went up as he bent a cool long look on her Scarlett understand this If you and your bed still held any charms for me no looks and no entreaties could keep me away And I would have no sense of shame for anything I did for I made a bargain with youa bargain which I have kept and you are now breaking Keep your chaste bed my dear Do you mean to tell me cried Scarlett indignantly that you dont care You have tired of me havent you Well men tire more easily than women Keep your sanctity Scarlett It will work no hardship on me It doesnt matter he shrugged and grinned Fortunately the world is full of bedsand most of the beds are full of women You mean youd actually be so My dear innocent But of course Its a wonder I havent strayed long ere this I never held fidelity to be a virtue  Page    Gone With The Wind I shall lock my door every night Why bother If I wanted you no lock would keep me out He turned as though the subject were closed and left the room Scarlett heard him going back to the nursery where he was welcomed by the children She sat down abruptly She had had her way This was what she wanted and Ashley wanted But it was not making her happy Her vanity was sore and she was mortified at the thought that Rhett had taken it all so lightly that he didnt want her that he put her on the level of other women in other beds She wished she could think of some delicate way to tell Ashley that she and Rhett were no longer actually man and wife But she knew now she could not It all seemed a terrible mess now and she half heartedly wished she had said nothing about it She would miss the long amusing conversations in bed with Rhett when the ember of his cigar glowed in the dark She would miss the comfort of his arms when she woke terrified from the dreams that she was running through cold mist Suddenly she felt very unhappy and leaning her head on the arm of the chair she cried CHAPTER LII ONE RAINY AFTERNOON when Bonnie was barely past her first birthday Wade moped about the sitting room occasionally going to the window and flattening his nose on the dripping pane He was a slender weedy boy small for his eight years quiet almost to shyness never speaking unless spoken to He was bored and obviously at loss for entertainment for Ella was busy in the corner with her dolls Scarlett was at her secretary muttering to herself as she added a long column of figures and Rhett was lying on the floor swinging his watch by its chain just out of Bonnies reach After Wade had picked up several books and let them drop with bangs and sighed deeply Scarlett turned to him in irritation Heavens Wade Run out and play I cant Its raining Is it I hadnt noticed Well do something You make me nervous fidgeting about Go tell Pork to hitch up the carriage and take you over to play with Beau He isnt home sighed Wade Hes at Raoul Picards birthday party Raoul was the small son of Maybelle and Ren Picarda detestable little brat Scarlett thought more like an ape than a child Well you can go to see anyone you want to Run tell Pork Nobodys at home answered Wade Everybodys at the party The unspoken words everybodybut me hung in the air but Scarlett her mind on her account books paid no heed Rhett raised himself to a sitting posture and said Why arent you at the party too son Wade edged closer to him scuffing one foot and looking unhappy I wasnt invited sir Rhett handed his watch into Bonnies destructive grasp and rose lightly to his feet Leave those damned figures alone Scarlett Why wasnt Wade invited to this party For Heavens sake Rhett Dont bother me now Ashley has gotten these accounts in an awful snarl Oh that party Well I think its nothing unusual that Wade wasnt invited and I wouldnt let him go if he had been Dont forget that Raoul is Mrs Merriwethers grandchild and Mrs Merriwether would as soon have a free issue nigger in her sacred parlor as one of us Rhett watching Wades face with meditative eyes saw the boy flinch Come here son he said drawing the boy to him Would you like to be at that party No sir said Wade bravely but his eyes fell Hum Tell me Wade do you go to little Joe Whitings parties or Frank Bonnells orwell any of your playmates No sir I dont get invited to many parties Wade you are lying cried Scarlett turning You went to three last week the Bart childrens party and the Gelerts and the Hundons As choice a collection of mules in horse harness as you could group together said Rhett his voice going into a soft drawl Did you have a good time at those parties Speak up No sir Why not II dunno sir MammyMammy says theyre white trash Ill skin Mammy this minute cried Scarlett leaping to her feet And as for you Wade talking so about Mothers friends The boys telling the truth and so is Mammy said Rhett But of course youve never been able to know the truth if you met it in the road  Dont bother son You dont have to go to any more parties you dont want to go to Here he pulled a bill from his pocket tell Pork to harness the carriage and take you downtown Buy yourself some candya lot enough to give you a wonderful stomach ache Wade beaming pocketed the bill and looked anxiously toward his mother for confirmation But she with a pucker in her brows was watching Rhett He had picked Bonnie from the floor and was cradling her to him her small face against his cheek She could not read his face but there was something in his eyes almost like fearfear and selfaccusation Wade encouraged by his stepfathers generosity came shyly toward him Uncle Rhett can I ask you sumpin Of course Rhetts look was anxious absent as he held Bonnies head closer What is it Wade Uncle Rhett were youdid you fight in the war Rhetts eyes came alertly back and they were sharp but his voice was casual Why do you ask son Well Joe Whiting said you didnt and so did Frankie Bonnell Ah said Rhett and what did you tell them  Page    Gone With The Wind Wade looked unhappy II saidI told them I didnt know And with a rush But I didnt care and I hit them Were you in the war Uncle Rhett Yes said Rhett suddenly violent I was in the war I was in the army for eight months I fought all the way from Lovejoy up to Franklin Tennessee And I was with Johnston when he surrendered Wade wriggled with pride but Scarlett laughed I thought you were ashamed of your war record she said Didnt you tell me to keep it quiet Hush he said briefly Does that satisfy you Wade Oh yes sir I knew you were in the war I knew you werent scared like they said Butwhy werent you with the other little boys fathers Because the other little boys fathers were such fools they had to put them in the infantry I was a West Pointer and so I was in the artillery In the regular artillery Wade not the Home Guard It takes a pile of sense to be in the artillery Wade I bet said Wade his face shining Did you get wounded Uncle Rhett Rhett hesitated Tell him about your dysentery jeered Scarlett Rhett carefully set the baby on the floor and pulled his shirt and undershirt out of his trouser band Come here Wade and Ill show you where I was wounded Wade advanced excited and gazed where Rhetts finger pointed A long raised scar ran across his brown chest and down into his heavily muscled abdomen It was the souvenir of a knife fight in the California gold fields but Wade did not know it He breathed heavily and happily I guess youre bout as brave as my father Uncle Rhett Almost but not quite said Rhett stuffing his shirt into his trousers Now go on and spend your dollar and whale hell out of any boy who says I wasnt in the army Wade went dancing out happily calling to Pork and Rhett picked up the baby again Now why all these lies my gallant soldier laddie asked Scarlett A boy has to be proud of his fatheror stepfather I cant let him be ashamed before the other little brutes Cruel creatures children Oh fiddledeedee I never thought about what it meant to Wade said Rhett slowly I never thought how hes suffered And its not going to be that way for Bonnie What way Do you think Im going to have my Bonnie ashamed of her father Have her left out of parties when shes nine or ten Do you think Im going to have her humiliated like Wade for things that arent her fault but yours and mine Oh childrens parties Out of childrens parties grow young girls dbut parties Do you think Im going to let my daughter grow up outside of everything decent in Atlanta Im not going to send her North to school and to visit because she wont be accepted here or in Charleston or Savannah or New Orleans And Im not going to see her forced to marry a Yankee or a foreigner because no decent Southern family will have herbecause her mother was a fool and her father a blackguard Wade who had come back to the door was an interested but puzzled listener Bonnie can marry Beau Uncle Rhett The anger went from Rhetts face as he turned to the little boy and he considered his words with apparent seriousness as he always did when dealing with the children Thats true Wade Bonnie can marry Beau Wilkes but who will you marry Oh I shant marry anyone said Wade confidently luxuriating in a mantoman talk with the one person except Aunt Melly who never reproved and always encouraged him Im going to go to Harvard and be a lawyer like my father and then Im going to be a brave soldier just like him I wish Melly would keep her mouth shut cried Scarlett Wade you are not going to Harvard Its a Yankee school and I wont have you going to a Yankee school You are going to the University of Georgia and after you graduate you are going to manage the store for me And as for your father being a brave soldier Hush said Rhett curtly not missing the shining light in Wades eyes when he spoke of the father he had never known You grow up and be a brave man like your father Wade Try to be just like him for he was a hero and dont let anyone tell you differently He married your mother didnt he Well thats proof enough of heroism And Ill see that you go to Harvard and become a lawyer Now run along and tell Pork to take you to town Ill thank you to let me manage my children cried Scarlett as Wade obediently trotted from the room Youre a damned poor manager Youve wrecked whatever chances Ella and Wade had but I wont permit you to do Bonnie that way Bonnies going to be a little princess and everyone in the world is going to want her Theres not going to be any place she cant go Good God do you think Im going to let her grow up and associate with the riffraff that fills this house They are good enough for you And a damned sight too good for you my pet But not for Bonnie Do you think Id let her marry any of this runagate gang you spend your time with Irishmen on the make Yankees white trash Carpetbag parvenus My Bonnie with her Butler blood and her Robillard strain The OHaras The OHaras might have been kings of Ireland once but your father was nothing but a smart Mick on the make And you are no better But then Im at fault too Ive gone through life like a bat out of hell never caring what I did because nothing ever mattered to me But Bonnie matters God what a fool Ive been Bonnie wouldnt be received in Charleston no matter what my mother or your Aunt Eulalie or Aunt Pauline didand its obvious that she wont be received here unless we do something  Page    Gone With The Wind quickly Oh Rhett you take it so seriously youre funny With our money Damn our money All our money cant buy what I want for her Id rather Bonnie was invited to eat dry bread in the Picards miserable house or Mrs Elsings rickety barn than to be the belle of a Republican inaugural ball Scarlett youve been a fool You should have insured a place for your children in the social scheme years agobut you didnt You didnt even bother to keep what position you had And its too much to hope that youll mend your ways at this late date Youre too anxious to make money and too fond of bullying people I consider this whole affair a tempest in a teapot said Scarlett coldly rattling her papers to indicate that as far as she was concerned the discussion was finished We have only Mrs Wilkes to help us and you do your best to alienate and insult her Oh spare me your remarks about her poverty and her tacky clothes Shes the soul and the center of everything in Atlanta thats sterling Thank God for her Shell help me do something about it And what are you going to do Do Im going to cultivate every female dragon of the Old Guard in this town especially Mrs Merriwether Mrs Elsing Mrs Whiting and Mrs Meade If I have to crawl on my belly to every fat old cat who hates me Ill do it Ill be meek under their coldness and repentant of my evil ways Ill contribute to their damned charities and Ill go to their damned churches Ill admit and brag about my services to the Confederacy and if worst comes to worst Ill join their damned Klanthough a merciful God could hardly lay so heavy a penance on my shoulders as that And I shall not hesitate to remind the fools whose necks I saved that they owe me a debt And you Madam will kindly refrain from undoing my work behind my back and foreclosing mortgages on any of the people Im courting or selling them rotten lumber or in other ways insulting them And Governor Bullock never sets foot in this house again Do you hear And none of this gang of elegant thieves youve been associating with either If you do in vite them over my request you will find yourself in the embarrassing position of having no host in your home If they come in this house I will spend the time in Belle Watlings bar telling anyone who cares to hear that I wont stay under the same roof with them Scarlett who had been smarting under his words laughed shortly So the riverboat gambler and the speculator is going to be respectable Well your first move toward respectability had better be the sale of Belle Watlings house That was a shot in the dark She had never been absolutely certain that Rhett owned the house He laughed suddenly as though he read her mind Thanks for the suggestion Had he tried Rhett could not have chosen a more difficult time to beat his way back to respectability Never before or after did the names Republican and Scalawag carry such odium for now the corruption of the Carpet bag regime was at its height And since the surrender Rhetts name had been inextricably linked with Yankees Republicans and Scalawags Atlanta people had thought with helpless fury in  that nothing could be worse than the harsh military rule they had then but now under Bullock they were learning the worst Thanks to the negro vote the Republicans and their allies were firmly entrenched and they were riding roughshod over the powerless but still protesting minority Word had been spread among the negroes that there were only two political parties mentioned in the Bible the Publicans and the Sinners No negro wanted to join a party made up entirely of sinners so they hastened to join the Republicans Their new masters voted them over and over again electing poor whites and Scalawags to high places electing even some negroes These negroes sat in the legislature where they spent most of their time eating goobers and easing their unaccustomed feet into and out of new shoes Few of them could read or write They were fresh from cotton patch and canebrake but it was within their power to vote taxes and bonds as well as enormous expense accounts to themselves and their Republican friends And they voted them The state staggered under taxes which were paid in fury for the taxpayers knew that much of the money voted for public purposes was finding its way into private pockets Completely surrounding the state capital was a host of promoters speculators seekers after contracts and others hoping to profit from the orgy of spending and many were growing shamelessly rich They had no difficulty at all in obtaining the states money for building railroads that were never built for buying cars and engines that were never bought for erecting public buildings that never existed except in the minds of their promoters Bonds were issued running into the millions Most of them were illegal and fraudulent but they were issued just the same The state treasurer a Republican but an honest man protested against the illegal issues and refused to sign them but he and others who sought to check the abuses could do nothing against the tide that was running The stateowned railroad had once been an asset to the state but now it was a liability and its debts had piled up to the million mark It was no longer a railroad It was an enormous bottomless trough in which the hogs could swill and wallow Many of its officials were appointed for political reasons regardless of their knowledge of the operation of railroads there were three times as many people employed as were necessary Republicans rode free on passes carloads of negroes rode free on their happy jaunts about the state to vote and revote in the same elections The mismanagement of the state road especially infuriated the taxpayers for out of the earnings of the road was to come the money for free schools But there were no earnings there were only debts and so there were no free schools and there was a generation of children growing up in ignorance who would spread the seeds of illiteracy down the years But far and above their anger at the waste and mismanagement and graft was the resentment of the people at the bad light in which the governor represented them in the North When Georgia howled against corruption the governor hastily went North appeared before Congress and told of white outrages against negroes of Georgias preparation for another rebellion and the need for a stern military rule in the state No Georgian wanted trouble with the negroes and they tried to avoid trouble No one wanted another war no one wanted or needed bayonet rule All Georgia wanted was to be let alone so the state could recuperate But with  Page    Gone With The Wind the operation of what came to be known as the governors slander mill the North saw only a rebellious state that needed a heavy hand and a heavy hand was laid upon it It was a glorious spree for the gang which had Georgia by the throat There was an orgy of grabbing and over all there was a cold cynicism about open theft in high places that was chilling to contemplate Protests and efforts to resist accomplished nothing for the state government was being upheld and supported by the power of the United States Army Atlanta cursed the name of Bullock and his Scalawags and Republicans and they cursed the name of anyone connected with them And Rhett was connected with them He had been in with them so everyone said in all their schemes But now he turned against the stream in which he had drifted so short a while before and began swimming arduously back against the current He went about his campaign slowly subtly not arousing the suspicions of Atlanta by the spectacle of a leopard trying to change his spots overnight He avoided his dubious cronies and was seen no more in the company of Yankee officers Scalawags and Republicans He attended Democratic rallies and he ostentatiously voted the Democratic ticket He gave up highstake card games and stayed comparatively sober If he went to Belle Watlings house at all he went by night and by stealth as did more respectable townsmen instead of leaving his horse hitched in front of her door in the afternoons as an advertisement of his presence within And the congregation of the Episcopal Church almost fell out of their pews when he tiptoed in late for services with Wades hand held in his The congregation was as much stunned by Wades appearance as by Rhetts for the little boy was supposed to be a Catholic At least Scarlett was one Or she was supposed to be one But she had not put foot in the church in years for religion had gone from her as many of Ellens other teachings had gone Everyone thought she had neglected her boys religious education and thought more of Rhett for trying to rectify the matter even if he did take the boy to the Episcopal Church instead of the Catholic Rhett could be grave of manner and charming when he chose to restrain his tongue and keep his black eyes from dancing maliciously It had been years since he had chosen to do this but he did it now putting on gravity and charm even as he put on waistcoats of more sober hues It was not difficult to gain a foothold of friendliness with the men who owed their necks to him They would have showed their appreciation long ago had Rhett not acted as if their appreciation were a matter of small moment Now Hugh Elsing Ren the Simmons boys Andy Bonnell and the others found him pleasant diffident about putting himself forward and embarrassed when they spoke of the obligation they owed him It was nothing he would protest In my place youd have all done the same thing He subscribed handsomely to the fund for the repairs of the Episcopal Church and he gave a large but not vulgarly large contribution to the Association for the Beautification of the Graves of Our Glorious Dead He sought out Mrs Elsing to make this donation and embarrassedly begged that she keep his gift a secret knowing very well that this would spur her to spreading the news Mrs Elsing hated to take his moneyspeculator moneybut the Association needed money badly I dont see why you of all people should be subscribing she said acidly When Rhett told her with the proper sober mien that he was moved to contribute by the memories of former comrades in arms braver than he but less fortunate who now lay in unmarked graves Mrs Elsings aristocratic jaw dropped Dolly Merriwether had told her Scarlett had said Captain Butler was in the army but of course she hadnt believed it Nobody had believed it You in the army What was your companyyour regiment Rhett gave them Oh the artillery Everyone I knew was either in the cavalry or the infantry Then that explains She broke off disconcerted expecting to see his eyes snap with that ice But he only looked down and toyed with his watch chain I would have liked the infantry he said passing completely over her insinuation but when they found that I was a West Pointerthough I did not graduate Mrs Elsing due to a boyish prankthey put me in the artillery the regular artillery not the militia They needed men with specialized knowledge in that last campaign You know how heavy the losses had been so many artillerymen killed It was pretty lonely in the artillery I didnt see a soul I knew I dont believe I saw a single man from Atlanta during my whole service Well said Mrs Elsing confused If he had been in the army then she was wrong She had made many sharp remarks about his cowardice and the memory of them made her feel guilty Well And why havent you ever told anybody about your service You act as though you were ashamed of it Rhett looked her squarely in the eyes his face blank Mrs Elsing he said earnestly believe me when I say that I am prouder of my services to the Confederacy than of anything I have ever done or will do I feelI feel Well why did you keep it hidden I was ashamed to speak of it in the light ofof some of my former actions Mrs Elsing reported the contribution and the conversation in detail to Mrs Merriwether And Dolly I give you my word that when he said that about being ashamed tears came into his eyes Yes tears I nearly cried myself Stuff and nonsense cried Mrs Merriwether in disbelief I dont believe tears came into his eyes any more than I believe he was in the army And I can find out mighty quick If he was in that artillery outfit I can get at the truth for Colonel Carleton who commanded it married the daughter of one of my grandfathers sisters and Ill write him She wrote Colonel Carlton and to her consternation received a reply praising Rhetts services in no uncertain terms A born artilleryman a brave soldier and an uncomplaining gentleman a modest man who wouldnt even take a commission when it was offered him Well said Mrs Merriwether showing the letter to Mrs Elsing You can knock me down with a feather Maybe we did misjudge the scamp about not being a soldier Maybe we should have believed what Scarlett and Melanie said about him enlisting the day the town fell But just the same hes a Scalawag and a rascal and I dont like him Somehow said Mrs Elsing uncertainly somehow I dont think hes so bad A man who fought for the Confederacy cant  Page    Gone With The Wind be all bad Its Scarlett who is the bad one Do you know Dolly I really believe that hewell hes ashamed of Scarlett but is too much of a gentleman to let on Ashamed Pooh Theyre both cut out of the same piece of cloth Where did you ever get such a silly notion It isnt silly said Mrs Elsing indignantly Yesterday in the pouring rain he had those three children even the baby mind you out in his carriage riding them up and down Peachtree Street and he gave me a lift home And when I said Captain Butler have you lost your mind keeping these children out in the damp Why dont you take them home And he didnt say a word but just looked embarrassed But Mammy spoke up and said De house full of wite trash an it healthier fer de chillun in de rain dan at home  What did he say What could he say He just scowled at Mammy and passed it over You know Scarlett was giving a big whist party yesterday afternoon with all those common ordinary women there I guess he didnt want them kissing his baby Well said Mrs Merriwether wavering but still obstinate But the next week she too capitulated Rhett now had a desk in the bank What he did at this desk the bewildered officials of the bank did not know but he owned too large a block of the stock for them to protest his presence there After a while they forgot that they had objected to him for he was quiet and well mannered and actually knew something about banking and investments At any rate he sat at his desk all day giving every appearance of industry for he wished to be on equal terms with his respectable fellow townsmen who worked and worked hard Mrs Merriwether wishing to expand her growing bakery had tried to borrow two thousand dollars from the bank with her house as security She had been refused because there were already two mortgages on the house The stout old lady was storming out of the bank when Rhett stopped her learned the trouble and said worriedly But there must be some mistake Mrs Merriwether Some dreadful mistake You of all people shouldnt have to bother about collateral Why Id lend you money just on your word Any lady who could build up the business youve built up is the best risk in the world The bank wants to lend money to people like you Now do sit down right here in my chair and I will attend to it for you When he came back he was smiling blandly saying that there had been a mistake just as he had thought The two thousand dollars was right there waiting for her whenever she cared to draw against it Now about her housewould she just sign right here Mrs Merriwether torn with indignation and insult furious that she had to take this favor from a man she disliked and distrusted was hardly gracious in her thanks But he failed to notice it As he escorted her to the door he said Mrs Merriwether I have always had a great regard for your knowledge and I wonder if you could tell me something The plumes on her bonnet barely moved as she nodded What did you do when your Maybelle was little and she sucked her thumb What My Bonnie sucks her thumb I cant make her stop it You should make her stop it said Mrs Merriwether vigorously It will ruin the shape of her mouth I know I know And she has a beautiful mouth But I dont know what to do Well Scarlett ought to know said Mrs Merriwether shortly Shes had two other children Rhett looked down at his shoes and sighed Ive tried putting soap under her finger nails he said passing over her remark about Scarlett Soap Bah Soap is no good at all I put quinine on Maybelles thumb and let me tell you Captain Butler she stopped sucking that thumb mighty quick Quinine I would never have thought of it I cant thank you enough Mrs Merriwether It was worrying me He gave her a smile so pleasant so grateful that Mrs Merriwether stood uncertainly for a moment But as she told him goodby she was smiling too She hated to admit to Mrs Elsing that she had misjudged the man but she was an honest person and she said there had to be something good about a man who loved his child What a pity Scarlett took no interest in so pretty a creature as Bonnie There was something pathetic about a man trying to raise a little girl all by himself Rhett knew very well the pathos of the spectacle and if it blackened Scarletts reputation he did not care From the time the child could walk he took her about with him constantly in the carriage or in front of his saddle When he came home from the bank in the afternoon he took her walking down Peachtree Street holding her hand slowing his long strides to her toddling steps patiently answering her thousand questions People were always in their front yards or on their porches at sunset and as Bonnie was such a friendly pretty child with her tangle of black curls and her bright blue eyes few could resist talking to her Rhett never presumed on these conversations but stood by exuding fatherly pride and gratification at the notice taken of his daughter Atlanta had a long memory and was suspicious and slow to change Times were hard and feeling was bitter against anyone who had had anything to do with Bullock and his crowd But Bonnie had the combined charm of Scarlett and Rhett at their best and she was the small opening wedge Rhett drove into the wall of Atlantas coldness Bonnie grew rapidly and every day it became more evident that Gerald OHara had been her grandfather She had short sturdy legs and wide eyes of Irish blue and a small square jaw that went with a determination to have her own way She had Geralds sudden temper to which she gave vent in screaming tantrums that were forgotten as soon as her wishes were gratified And as long as her father was near her they were always gratified hastily He spoiled her despite all the efforts of Mammy and Scarlett for in all things she pleased him except one And that was her fear of the dark Until she was two years old she went to sleep readily in the nursery she shared with Wade and Ella Then for no apparent reason she began to sob whenever Mammy waddled out of the room carrying the lamp From this she progressed to wakening in the late night hours screaming with terror frightening the other two children and alarming the house Once Dr Meade had to be  Page    Gone With The Wind called and Rhett was short with him when he diagnosed only bad dreams All anyone could get from her was one word Dark Scarlett was inclined to be irritated with the child and favored a spanking She would not humor her by leaving a lamp burning in the nursery for then Wade and Ella would be unable to sleep Rhett worried but gentle attempting to extract further information from his daughter said coldly that if any spanking were done he would do it personally and to Scarlett The upshot of the situation was that Bonnie was removed from the nursery to the room Rhett now occupied alone Her small bed was placed beside his large one and a shaded lamp burned on the table all night long The town buzzed when this story got about Somehow there was something indelicate about a girl child sleeping in her fathers room even though the girl was only two years old Scarlett suffered from this gossip in two ways First it proved indubitably that she and her husband occupied sep arate rooms in itself a shocking enough state of affairs Second everyone thought that if the child was afraid to sleep alone her place was with her mother And Scarlett did not feel equal to explaining that she could not sleep in a lighted room nor would Rhett permit the child to sleep with her Youd never wake up unless she screamed and then youd probably slap her he said shortly Scarlett was annoyed at the weight he attached to Bonnies night terrors but she thought she could eventually remedy the state of affairs and transfer the child back to the nursery All children were afraid of the dark and the only cure was firmness Rhett was just being perverse in the matter making her appear a poor mother just to pay her back for banishing him from her room He had never put foot in her room or even rattled the door knob since the night she told him she did not want any more children Thereafter and until he began staying at home on account of Bonnies fears he had been absent from the supper table more often than he had been present Sometimes he had stayed out all night and Scarlett lying awake behind her locked door hearing the clock count off the early morning hours wondered where he was She remembered There are other beds my dear Though the thought made her writhe there was nothing she could do about it There was nothing she could say that would not precipitate a scene in which he would be sure to remark upon her locked door and the probable connection Ashley had with it Yes his foolishness about Bonnie sleeping in a lighted roomin his lighted roomwas just a mean way of paying her back She did not realize the importance he attached to Bonnies foolishness nor the completeness of his devotion to the child until one dreadful night The family never forgot that night That day Rhett had met an exblockade runner and they had had much to say to each other Where they had gone to talk and drink Scarlett did not know but she suspected of course Belle Watlings house He did not come home in the afternoon to take Bonnie walking nor did he come home to supper Bonnie who had watched from the window impatiently all afternoon anxious to display a mangled collection of beetles and roaches to her father had finally been put to bed by Lou amid wails and protests Either Lou had forgotten to light the lamp or it had burned out No one ever knew exactly what happened but when Rhett finally came home somewhat the worse for drink the house was in an uproar and Bonnies screams reached him even in the stables She had waked in darkness and called for him and he had not been there All the nameless horrors that peopled her small imagination clutched her All the soothing and bright lights brought by Scarlett and the servants could not quiet her and Rhett coming up the stairs three at a jump looked like a man who has seen Death When he finally had her in his arms and from her sobbing gasps had recognized only one word Dark he turned on Scarlett and the negroes in fury Who put out the light Who left her alone in the dark Prissy Ill skin you for this you Gawdlmighty Mist Rhett Twarnt me Twuz Lou Fo Gawd Mist Rhett Ah Shut up You know my orders By God Illget out Dont come back Scarlett give her some money and see that shes gone before I come down stairs Now everybody get out everybody The negroes fled the luckless Lou wailing into her apron But Scarlett remained It was hard to see her favorite child quieting in Rhetts arms when she had screamed so pitifully in her own It was hard to see the small arms going around his neck and hear the choking voice relate what had frightened her when she Scarlett had gotten nothing coherent out of her So it sat on your chest said Rhett softly Was it a big one Oh yes Dretfull big And claws Ah claws too Well now I shall certainly sit up all night and shoot him if he comes back Rhetts voice was interested and soothing and Bonnies sobs died away Her voice became less choked as she went into detailed description of her monster guest in a language which only he could understand Irritation stirred in Scarlett as Rhett discussed the matter as if it had been something real For Heavens sake Rhett But he made a sign for silence When Bonnie was at last asleep he laid her in her bed and pulled up the sheet Im going to skin that nigger alive he said quietly Its your fault too Why didnt you come up here to see if the light was burning Dont be a fool Rhett she whispered She gets this way because you humor her Lots of children are afraid of the dark but they get over it Wade was afraid but I didnt pamper him If youd just let her scream for a night or two Let her scream For a moment Scarlett thought he would hit her Either you are a fool or the most inhuman woman Ive ever seen I dont want her to grow up nervous and cowardly Cowardly Hells afire There isnt a cowardly bone in her body But you havent any imagination and of course you cant appreciate the tortures of people who have oneespecially a child If something with claws and horns came and sat on your chest youd tell it to get the hell off you wouldnt you Like hell you would Kindly remember Madam that Ive seen you wake up squalling like a scalded cat simply because you dreamed of running in a fog And thats not been so long ago either Scarlett was taken aback for she never liked to think of that dream Moreover it embarrassed her to remember that Rhett had comforted her in much the same manner he comforted Bonnie So she swung rapidly to a different attack  Page    Gone With The Wind You are just humoring her and And I intend to keep on humoring her If I do shell outgrow it and forget about it Then said Scarlett acidly if you intend to play nursemaid you might try coming home nights and sober too for a change I shall come home early but drunk as a fiddlers bitch if I please He did come home early thereafter arriving long before time for Bonnie to be put to bed He sat beside her holding her hand until sleep loosened her grasp Only then did he tiptoe downstairs leaving the lamp burning brightly and the door ajar so he might hear her should she awake and become frightened Never again did he intend her to have a recurrence of fear of the dark The whole household was acutely conscious of the burning light Scarlett Mammy Prissy and Pork frequently tiptoeing upstairs to make sure that it still burned He came home sober too but that was none of Scarletts doing For months he had been drinking heavily though he was never actually drunk and one evening the smell of whisky was especially strong upon his breath He picked up Bonnie swung her to his shoulder and asked her Have you a kiss for your sweetheart She wrinkled her small upturned nose and wriggled to get down from his arms No she said frankly Nasty Im what Smell nasty Uncle Ashley dont smell nasty Well Ill be damned he said ruefully putting her on the floor I never expected to find a temperance advocate in my own home of all places But thereafter he limited his drinking to a glass of wine after supper Bonnie who was always permitted to have the last drops in the glass did not think the smell of wine nasty at all As the result the puffiness which had begun to obscure the hard lines of his cheeks slowly disappeared and the circles beneath his black eyes were not so dark or so harshly cut Because Bonnie liked to ride on the front of his saddle he stayed out of doors more and the sunburn began to creep across his dark face making him swarthier than ever He looked healthier and laughed more and was again like the dashing young blockader who had excited Atlanta early in the war People who had never liked him came to smile as he went by with the small figure perched before him on his saddle Women who had heretofore believed that no woman was safe with him began to stop and talk with him on the streets to admire Bonnie Even the strictest old ladies felt that a man who could discuss the ailments and problems of childhood as well as he did could not be altogether bad CHAPTER LIII IT WAS Ashleys birthday and Melanie was giving him a surprise reception that night Everyone knew about the reception except Ashley Even Wade and little Beau knew and were sworn to secrecy that puffed them up with pride Everyone in Atlanta who was nice had been invited and was coming General Gordon and his family had graciously accepted Alexander Stephens would be present if his everuncertain health permitted and even Bob Toombs the stormy petrel of the Confederacy was expected All that morning Scarlett with Melanie India and Aunt Pitty flew about the little house directing the negroes as they hung freshly laundered curtains polished silver waxed the floor and cooked stirred and tasted the refreshments Scarlett had never seen Melanie so excited or so happy You see dear Ashley hasnt had a birthday party sincesince you remember the barbecue at Twelve Oaks The day we heard about Mr Lincolns call for volunteers Well he hasnt had a birthday party since then And he works so hard and hes so tired when he gets home at night that he really hasnt thought about today being his birthday And wont he be surprised after supper when everybody troops in How you goin to manage them lanterns on the lawn without Mr Wilkes seein them when he comes home to supper demanded Archie grumpily He had sat all morning watching the preparations interested but unwilling to admit it He had never been behind the scenes at a large town folks party and it was a new experience He made frank remarks about women running around like the house was afire just because they were having company but wild horses could not have dragged him from the scene The coloredpaper lanterns which Mrs Elsing and Fanny had made and painted for the occasion held a special interest for him as he had never seen sech contraptions before They had been hidden in his room in the cellar and he had examined them minutely Mercy I hadnt thought of that cried Melanie Archie how fortunate that you mentioned it Dear dear What shall I do Theyve got to be strung on the bushes and trees and little candles put in them and lighted just at the proper time when the guests are arriving Scarlett can you send Pork down to do it while were eating supper Miz Wilkes you got more sense than most women but you gits flurried right easy said Archie And as for that fool nigger Pork he aint got no bizness with them thar contraptions Hed set them afire in no time They areright pretty he conceded Ill hang them for you whilst you and Mr Wilkes are eatin Oh Archie how kind of you Melanie turned childlike eyes of gratitude and dependence upon him I dont know what I should do without you Do you suppose you could go put the candles in them now so wed have that much out of the way Well I could praps said Archie ungraciously and stumped off toward the cellar stairs Theres more ways of killing a cat than choking him to death with butter giggled Melanie when the whiskered old man had thumped down the stairs I had intended all along for Archie to put up those lanterns but you know how he is He wont do a thing if you ask him to And now weve got him out from underfoot for a while The darkies are so scared of him they just wont do any work when hes around breathing down their necks Melly I wouldnt have that old desperado in my house said Scarlett crossly She hated Archie as much as he hated her and they barely spoke Melanies was the only house in which he would remain if she were present And even in Melanies house he  Page    Gone With The Wind stared at her with suspicion and cold contempt Hell cause you trouble mark my words Oh hes harmless if you flatter him and act like you depend on him said Melanie And hes so devoted to Ashley and Beau that I always feel safe having him around You mean hes so devoted to you Melly said India her cold face relaxing into a faintly warm smile as her gaze rested fondly on her sisterinlaw I believe youre the first person that old ruffian has loved since his wifeersince his wife I think hed really like for somebody to insult you so he could kill them to show his respect for you Mercy How you run on India said Melanie blushing He thinks Im a terrible goose and you know it Well I dont see that what that smelly old hillbilly thinks is of any importance said Scarlett abruptly The very thought of how Archie had sat in judgment upon her about the convicts always enraged her I have to go now Ive got to go get dinner and then go by the store and pay off the clerks and go by the lumber yard and pay the drivers and Hugh Elsing Oh are you going to the lumber yard asked Melanie Ashley is coming in to the yard in the late afternoon to see Hugh Can you possibly hold him there till five oclock If he comes home earlier hell be sure to catch us finishing up a cake or something and then he wont be surprised at all Scarlett smiled inwardly good temper restored Yes Ill hold him she said As she spoke Indias pale lashless eyes met hers piercingly She always looks at me so oddly when I speak of Ashley thought Scarlett Well hold him there as long as you can after five oclock said Melanie And then India will drive down and pick him up  Scarlett do come early tonight I dont want you to miss a minute of the reception As Scarlett rode home she thought sullenly She doesnt want me to miss a minute of the reception eh Well then why didnt she invite me to receive with her and India and Aunt Pitty Generally Scarlett would not have cared whether she received at Mellys piddling parties or not But this was the largest party Melanie had ever given and Ashleys birthday party too and Scarlett longed to stand by Ashleys side and receive with him But she knew why she had not been invited to receive Even had she not known it Rhetts comment on the subject had been frank enough A Scalawag receive when all die prominent exConfederates and Democrats are going to be there Your notions are as enchanting as they are muddle headed Its only because of Miss Mellys loyalty that you are invited at all Scarlett dressed with more than usual care that afternoon for her trip to the store and the lumber yard wearing the new dullgreen changeable taffeta frock that looked lilac in some lights and the new palegreen bonnet circled about with darkgreen plumes If only Rhett would let her cut bangs and frizzle them on her forehead how much better this bonnet would look But he had declared that he would shave her whole head if she banged her forelocks And these days he acted so atrociously he really might do it It was a lovely afternoon sunny but not too hot bright but not glaring and the warm breeze that rustled the trees along Peachtree Street made the plumes on Scarletts bonnet dance Her heart danced too as always when she was going to see Ashley Perhaps if she paid off the team drivers and Hugh early they would go home and leave her and Ashley alone in the square little office in the middle of the lumber yard Chances to see Ashley alone were all too infrequent these days And to think that Melanie had asked her to hold him That was funny Her heart was merry when she reached the store and she paid off Willie and the other counter boys without even asking what the days business had been It was Saturday the biggest day of the week for the store for all the farmers came to town to shop that day but she asked no questions Along the way to the lumber yard she stopped a dozen times to speak with Carpetbagger ladies in splendid equipagesnot so splendid as her own she thought with pleasureand with many men who came through the red dust of the street to stand hat in hand and compliment her It was a beautiful afternoon she was happy she looked pretty and her progress was a royal one Because of these delays she arrived at the lumber yard later than she intended and found Hugh and the team drivers sitting on a low pile of lumber waiting for her Is Ashley here Yes hes in the office said Hugh the habitually worried expression leaving his face at the sight of her happy dancing eyes Hes trying toI mean hes going over the books Oh he neednt bother about that today she said and then lowering her voice Melly sent me down to keep him here till they get the house straight for the reception tonight Hugh smiled for he was going to the reception He liked parties and he guessed Scarlett did too from the way she looked this afternoon She paid off the teamsters and Hugh and abruptly leaving them walked toward the office showing plainly by her manner that she did not care to be accompanied Ashley met her at the door and stood in the afternoon sunshine his hair bright and on his lips a little smile that was almost a grin Why Scarlett what are you doing downtown this time of the day Why arent you out at my house helping Melly get ready for the surprise party Why Ashley Wilkes she cried indignantly You werent supposed to know a thing about it Melly will be so disappointed if you arent surprised Oh I wont let on Ill be the most surprised man in Atlanta said Ashley his eyes laughing Now who was mean enough to tell you Practically every man Melly invited General Gordon was the first He said it had been his experience that when women gave surprise parties they usually gave them on the very nights men had decided to polish and clean all the guns in the house And then Grandpa Merriwether warned me He said Mrs Merriwether gave him a surprise party once and she was the most surprised person there because Grandpa had been treating his rheumatism on the sly with a bottle of whisky and he was too drunk to get out of bed andoh every man whos ever had a surprise party given him told me  Page    Gone With The Wind The mean things cried Scarlett but she had to smile He looked like the old Ashley she knew at Twelve Oaks when he smiled like this And he smiled so seldom these days The air was so soft the sun so gentle Ashleys face so gay his talk so unconstrained that her heart leaped with happiness It swelled in her bosom until it positively ached with pleasure ached as with a burden of joyful hot unshed tears Suddenly she felt sixteen again and happy a little breathless and excited She had a mad impulse to snatch off her bonnet and toss it into the air and cry Hurray Then she thought how startled Ashley would be if she did this and she suddenly laughed laughed until tears came to her eyes He laughed too throwing back his head as though he enjoyed laughter thinking her mirth came from the friendly treachery of the men who had given Mellys secret away Come in Scarlett Im going over the books She passed into the small room blazing with the afternoon sun and sat down in the chair before the rolltopped desk Ashley following her seated himself on the corner of the rough table his long legs dangling easily Oh dont lets fool with any books this afternoon Ashley I just cant be bothered When Im wearing a new bonnet it seems like all the figures I know leave my head Figures are well lost when the bonnets as pretty as that one he said Scarlett you get prettier all the time He slipped from the table and laughing took her hands spreading them wide so he could see her dress You are so pretty I dont believe youll ever get old At his touch she realized that without being conscious of it she had hoped that just this thing would happen All this happy afternoon she had hoped for the warmth of his hands the tenderness of his eyes a word that would show he cared This was the first time they had been utterly alone since the cold day in the orchard at Tara the first time their hands had met in any but formal gestures and through the long months she had hungered for closer contact But now How odd that the touch of his hands did not excite her Once his very nearness would have set her atremble Now she felt a curious warm friendliness and content No fever leaped from his hands to hers and in his hands her heart hushed to happy quietness This puzzled her made her a little disconcerted He was still her Ashley still her bright shining darling and she loved him better than life Then why But she pushed the thought from her mind It was enough that she was with him and he was holding her hands and smiling completely friendly without strain or fever It seemed miraculous that this could be when she thought of all the unsaid things that lay between them His eyes looked into hers clear and shining smiling in the old way she loved smiling as though there had never been anything between them but happiness There was no barrier between his eyes and hers now no baffling remoteness She laughed Oh Ashley Im getting old and decrepit Ah thats very apparent No Scarlett when you are sixty youll look the same to me Ill always remember you as you were that day of our last barbecue sitting under an oak with a dozen boys around you I can even tell you just how you were dressed in a white dress covered with tiny green flowers and a white lace shawl about your shoulders You had on little green slippers with black lacings and an enormous leghorn hat with long green streamers I know that dress by heart because when I was in prison and things got too bad Id take out my memories and thumb them over like pictures recalling every little detail He stopped abruptly and the eager light faded from his face He dropped her hands gently and she sat waiting waiting for his next words Weve come a long way both of us since that day havent we Scarlett Weve traveled roads we never expected to travel Youve come swiftly directly and I slowly and reluctantly He sat down on the table again and looked at her and a small smile crept back into his face But it was not the smile that had made her so happy so short a while before It was a bleak smile Yes you came swiftly dragging me at your chariot wheels Scarlett sometimes I have an impersonal curiosity as to what would have happened to me without you Scarlett went quickly to defend him from himself more quickly because treacherously there rose to her mind Rhetts words on this same subject But Ive never done anything for you Ashley Without me youd have been just the same Some day youd have been a rich man a great man like you are going to be No Scarlett the seeds of greatness were never in me I think that if it hadnt been for you Id have gone down into oblivionlike poor Cathleen Calvert and so many other people who once had great names old names Oh Ashley dont talk like that You sound so sad No Im not sad Not any longer Onceonce I was sad Now Im only He stopped and suddenly she knew what he was thinking It was the first time she had ever known what Ashley was thinking when his eyes went past her crystal clear absent When the fury of love had beaten in her heart his mind had been closed to her Now in the quiet friendliness that lay between them she could walk a little way into his mind understand a little He was not sad any longer He had been sad after the surrender sad when she begged him to come to Atlanta Now he was only resigned I hate to hear you talk like that Ashley she said vehemently You sound just like Rhett Hes always harping on things like that and something he calls the survival of the fitting till Im so bored I could scream Ashley smiled Did you ever stop to think Scarlett that Rhett and I are fundamentally alike Oh no You are so fine so honorable and he She broke off confused But we are We came of the same kind of people we were raised in the same pattern brought up to think the same things And somewhere along the road we took different turnings We still think alike but we react differently As for instance neither of us believed in the war but I enlisted and fought and he stayed out till nearly the end We both knew the war was all wrong We both knew it was a losing fight I was willing to fight a losing fight He wasnt Sometimes I think he was right and then again  Oh Ashley when will you stop seeing both sides of questions she asked But she did not speak impatiently as she once  Page    Gone With The Wind would have done No one ever gets anywhere seeing both sides Thats true butScarlett just where do you want to get Ive often wondered You see I never wanted to get anywhere at all Ive only wanted to be myself Where did she want to get That was a silly question Money and security of course And yet Her mind fumbled She had money and as much security as one could hope for in an insecure world But now that she thought about it they werent quite enough Now that she thought about it they hadnt made her particularly happy though they made her less harried less fearful of the morrow If Id had money and security and you that would have been where I wanted to get she thought looking at him yearningly But she did not speak the words fearful of breaking the spell that lay between them fearful that his mind would close against her You only want to be yourself she laughed a little ruefully Not being myself has always been my hardest trouble As to where I want to get well I guess Ive gotten there I wanted to be rich and safe and But Scarlett did it ever occur to you that I dont care whether Im rich or not No it had never occurred to her that anyone would not want to be rich Then what do you want I dont know now I knew once but Ive half forgotten Mostly to be left alone not to be harried by people I dont like driven to do things I dont want to do PerhapsI want the old days back again and theyll never come back and I am haunted by the memory of them and of the world falling about my ears Scarlett set her mouth obstinately It was not that she did not know what he meant The very tones of his voice called up other days as nothing else could made her heart hurt suddenly as she too remembered But since the day she had lain sick and desolate in the garden at Twelve Oaks and said I wont look back she had set her face against the past I like these days better she said But she did not meet his eyes as she spoke Theres always something exciting happening now parties and so on Everythings got a glitter to it The old days were so dull Oh lazy days and warm still country twilights The high soft laughter from the quarters The golden warmth life had then and the comforting knowledge of what all tomorrows would bring How can I deny you I like these days better she said but her voice was tremulous He slipped from the table laughing softly in unbelief Putting his hand under her chin he turned her face up to his Ah Scarlett what a poor liar you are Yes life has a glitter nowof a sort Thats whats wrong with it The old days had no glitter but they had a charm a beauty a slowpaced glamour Her mind pulled two ways she dropped her eyes The sound of his voice the touch of his hand were softly unlocking doors that she had locked forever Behind those doors lay the beauty of the old days and a sad hunger for them welled up within her But she knew that no matter what beauty lay behind it must remain there No one could go forward with a load of aching memories His hand dropped from her chin and he took one of her hands between his two and held it gently Do you remember he saidand a warning bell in her mind rang Dont look back Dont look back But she swiftly disregarded it swept forward on a tide of happiness At last she was understanding him at last their minds had met This moment was too precious to be lost no matter what pain came after Do you remember he said and under the spell of his voice the bare walls of thelittle office faded and the years rolled aside and they were riding country bridle paths together in a longgone spring As he spoke his light grip tightened on her hand and in his voice was the sad magic of old halfforgotten songs She could hear the gay jingle of bridle bits as they rode under the dogwood trees to the Tarletons picnic hear her own careless laughter see the sun glinting on his silvergilt hair and note the proud easy grace with which he sat his horse There was music in his voice the music of fiddles and banjos to which they had danced in the white house that was no more There was the faroff yelping of possum dogs in the dark swamp under cool autumn moons and the smell of eggnog bowls wreathed with holly at Christmas time and smiles on black and white faces And old friends came trooping back laughing as though they had not been dead these many years Stuart and Brent with their long legs and their red hair and their practical jokes Tom and Boyd as wild as young horses Joe Fontaine with his hot black eyes and Cade and Raiford Calvert who moved with such languid grace There was John Wilkes too and Gerald red with brandy and a whisper and a fragrance that was Ellen Over it all rested a sense of security a knowledge that tomorrow could only bring the same happiness today had brought His voice stopped and they looked for a long quiet moment into each others eyes and between them lay the sunny lost youth that they had so unthinkingly shared Now I know why you cant be happy she thought sadly I never understood before I never understood before why I wasnt altogether happy either Butwhy we are talking like old people talk she thought with dreary surprise Old people looking back fifty years And were not old Its just that so much has happened in between Everythings changed so much that it seems like fifty years ago But were not old But when she looked at Ashley he was no longer young and shining His head was bowed as he looked down absently at her hand which he still held and she saw that his once bright hair was very gray silver gray as moonlight on still water Somehow the bright beauty had gone from the April afternoon and from her heart as well and the sad sweetness of remembering was as bitter as gall I shouldnt have let him make me look back she thought despairingly I was right when I said Id never look back It hurts too much it drags at your heart till you cant ever do anything else except look back Thats whats wrong with Ashley He cant look forward any more He cant see the present he fears the future and so he looks back I never understood it before I never understood Ashley before Oh Ashley my darling you shouldnt look back What good will it do I shouldnt have let you tempt me into talking of the old days This is what happens when you look back to happiness this pain this heartbreak this discontent She rose to her feet her hand still in his She must go She could not stay and think of the old days and see his face tired and sad and bleak as it now was Weve come a long way since those days Ashley she said trying to steady her voice trying to fight the constriction in her  Page    Gone With The Wind throat We had fine notions then didnt we And then with a rush Oh Ashley nothing has turned out as we expected It never does he said Lifes under no obligation to give us what we expect We take what we get and are thankful its no worse than it is Her heart was suddenly dull with pain with weariness as she thought of the long road she had come since those days There rose up in her mind the memory of Scarlett OHara who loved beaux and pretty dresses and who intended some day when she had the time to be a great lady like Ellen Without warning tears started in her eyes and rolled slowly down her cheeks and she stood looking at him dumbly like a hurt bewildered child He said no word but took her gently in his arms pressed her head against his shoulder and leaning down laid his cheek against hers She relaxed against him and her arms went round his body The comfort of his arms helped dry her sudden tears Ah it was good to be in his arms without passion without tenseness to be there as a loved friend Only Ashley who shared her memories and her youth who knew her beginnings and her present could understand She heard the sound of feet outside but paid little heed thinking it was the teamsters going home She stood for a moment listening to the slow beat of Ashleys heart Then suddenly he wrenched himself from her confusing her by his violence She looked up into his face in surprise but he was not looking at her He was looking over her shoulder at the door She turned and there stood India white faced her pale eyes blazing and Archie malevolent as a oneeyed parrot Behind them stood Mrs Elsing How she got out of the office she never remembered But she went instantly swiftly by Ashleys order leaving Ashley and Archie in grim converse in the little room and India and Mrs Elsing outside with their backs to her Shame and fear sped her homeward and in her mind Archie with his patriarchs beard assumed the proportions of an avenging angel straight from the pages of the Old Testament The house was empty and still in the April sunset All the servants had gone to a funeral and the children were playing in Melanies back yard Melanie Melanie Scarlett went cold at the thought of her as she climbed the stairs to her room Melanie would hear of this India had said she would tell her Oh India would glory in telling her not caring if she blackened Ashleys name not caring if she hurt Melanie if by so doing she could injure Scarlett And Mrs Elsing would talk too even though she had really seen nothing because she was behind India and Archie in the door of the lumber office But she would talk just the same The news would be all over town by supper time Everyone even the negroes would know by tomorrows breakfast At the party tonight women would gather in corners and whisper discreetly and with malicious pleasure Scarlett Butler rumbled from her high and mighty place And the story would grow and grow There was no way of stopping it It wouldnt stop at the bare facts that Ashley was holding her in his arms while she cried Before nightfall people would be saying she had been taken in adultery And it had been so innocent so sweet Scarlett thought wildly If we had been caught that Christmas of his furlough when I kissed him goodbyif we had been caught in the orchard at Tara when I begged him to run away with meoh if wed been caught any of the times when we were really guilty it wouldnt be so bad But now Now When I went to his arms as a friend But no one would believe that She wouldnt have a single friend to take her part not a single voice would be raised to say I dont believe she was doing anything wrong She had outraged old friends too long to find a champion among them now Her new friends suffering in silence under her insolences would welcome a chance to blackguard her No everybody would believe anything about her though they might regret that so fine a man as Ashley Wilkes was mixed up in so dirty an affair As usual they would cast the blame upon the woman and shrug at the mans guilt And in this case they would be right She had gone into his arms Oh she could stand the cuts the slights the covert smiles anything the town might say if she had to stand thembut not Melanie Oh not Melanie She did not know why she should mind Melanie knowing more than anyone else She was too frightened and weighed down by a sense of past guilt to try to understand it But she burst into tears at the thought of what would be in Melanies eyes when India told her that she had caught Ashley fondling Scarlett And what would Melanie do when she knew Leave Ashley What else could she do with any dignity And what will Ashley and I do then she thought frenziedly the tears streaming down her face Oh Ashley will die of shame and hate me for bringing this on him Suddenly her tears stopped short as a deadly fear went through her heart What of Rhett What would he do Perhaps hed never know What was that old saying that cynical saying The husband is always the last to find out Perhaps no one would tell him It would take a brave man to break such news to Rhett for Rhett had the reputation for shooting first and asking questions afterwards Please God dont let anybody be brave enough to tell him But she remembered the face of Archie in the lumber office the cold pale eye remorseless full of hate for her and all women Archie feared neither God nor man and he hated loose women He had hated them enough to kill one And he had said he would tell Rhett And hed tell him in spite of all Ashley could do to dissuade him Unless Ashley killed him Archie would tell Rhett feeling it his Christian duty She pulled off her clothes and lay down on the bed her mind whirling round and round If she could only lock her door and stay in this safe place forever and ever and never see anyone again Perhaps Rhett wouldnt find out tonight Shed say she had a headache and didnt feel like going to the reception By morning she would have thought up some excuse to offer some defense that might hold water I wont think of it now she said desperately burying her face in the pillow I wont think of it now Ill think of it later when I can stand it She heard the servants come back as night fell and it seemed to her that they were very silent as they moved about preparing supper Or was it her guilty conscience Mammy came to the door and knocked but Scarlett sent her away saying she did not want any supper Time passed and finally she heard Rhett coming up the steps She held herself tensely as he reached the upper hall gathered all her strength for a meeting but he passed into his room She breathed easier He hadnt heard Thank God he still respected her icy request that he never put foot in her bedroom again for if he saw her now her face would give her away She must gather herself together enough to tell him that she felt too ill to go to the reception Well there was time enough for her to  Page    Gone With The Wind calm herself Or was there time Since the awful moment that afternoon life had seemed timeless She heard Rhett moving about in his room for a long time speaking occasionally to Pork Still she could not find courage to call to him She lay still on the bed in the darkness shaking After a long time he knocked on her door and she said trying to control her voice Come in Am I actually being invited into the sanctuary he questioned opening the door It was dark and she could not see his face Nor could she make anything of his voice He entered and closed the door Are you ready for the reception Im so sorry but I have a headache How odd that her voice sounded natural Thank God for the dark I dont believe Ill go You go Rhett and give Melanie my regrets There was a long pause and he spoke drawlingly bitingly in the dark What a white livered cowardly little bitch you are He knew She lay shaking unable to speak She heard him fumble in the dark strike a match and the room sprang into light He walked over to the bed and looked down at her She saw that he was in evening clothes Get up he said and there was nothing in his voice We are going to the reception You will have to hurry Oh Rhett I cant You see I can see Get up Rhett did Archie dare Archie dared A very brave man Archie You should have killed him for telling lies I have a strange way of not killing people who tell the truth Theres no time to argue now Get up She sat up hugging her wrapper close to her her eyes searching his face It was dark and impassive I wont go Rhett I cant until thismisunderstanding is cleared up If you dont show your face tonight youll never be able to show it in this town as long as you live And while I may endure a trollop for a wife I wont endure a coward You are going tonight even if everyone from Alex Stephens down cuts you and Mrs Wilkes asks us to leave the house Rhett let me explain I dont want to hear There isnt time Get on your clothes They misunderstoodIndia and Mrs Elsing and Archie And they hate me so India hates me so much that shed even tell lies about her own brother to make me appear in a bad light If youll only let me explain Oh Mother of God she thought in agony suppose he says Pray do explain What can I say How can I explain Theyll have told everybody lies I cant go tonight You will go he said if I have to drag you by the neck and plant my boot on your ever so charming bottom every step of the way There was a cold glitter in his eyes as he jerked her to her feet He picked up her stays and threw them at her Put them on Ill lace you Oh yes I know all about lacing No I wont call Mammy to help you and have you lock the door and skulk here like the coward you are Im not a coward she cried stung out of her fear Oh spare me your saga about shooting Yankees and facing Shermans army Youre a cowardamong other things If not for your own sake you are going tonight for Bonnies sake How could you further ruin her chances Put on your stays quick Hastily she slipped off her wrapper and stood clad only in her chemise If only he would look at her and see how nice she looked in her chemise perhaps that frightening look would leave his face After all he hadnt seen her in her chemise for ever and ever so long But he did not look He was in her closet going through her dresses swiftly He fumbled and drew out her new jadegreen wateredsilk dress It was cut low over the bosom and the skirt was draped back over an enormous bustle and on the bustle was a huge bunch of pink velvet roses Wear that he said tossing it on the bed and coming toward her No modest matronly dove grays and lilacs tonight Your flag must be nailed to the mast for obviously youd run it down if it wasnt And plenty of rouge Im sure the woman the Pharisees took in adultery didnt look half so pale Turn around He took the strings of the stays in his hands and jerked them so hard that she cried out frightened humiliated embarrassed at such an untoward performance Hurts does it He laughed shortly and she could not see his face Pity it isnt around your neck Melanies house blazed lights from every room and they could hear the music far up the street As they drew up in front the pleasant exciting sounds of many people enjoying themselves floated out The house was packed with guests They overflowed on verandas and many were sitting on benches in the dim lanternhung yard I cant go inI cant thought Scarlett sitting in the carriage gripping her balledup handkerchief I cant I wont I will jump out and run away somewhere back home to Tara Why did Rhett force me to come here What will people do What will Melanie do What will she look like Oh I cant face her I will run away As though he read her mind Rhetts hand closed upon her arm in a grip that would leave a bruise the rough grip of a careless stranger Ive never known an Irishman to be a coward Wheres your muchvaunted courage Rhett do please let me go home and explain You have eternity in which to explain and only one night to be a martyr in the amphitheater Get out darling and let me see the lions eat you Get out She went up the walk somehow the arm she was holding as hard and steady as granite communicating to her some courage By God she could face them and she would What were they but a bunch of howling clawing cats who were jealous of her Shed show them She didnt care what they thought Only Melanieonly Melanie  Page    Gone With The Wind They were on the porch and Rhett was bowing right and left his hat in his hand his voice cool and soft The music stopped as they entered and the crowd of people seemed to her confused mind to surge up to her like the roar of the sea and then ebb away with lessening everlessening sound Was everyone going to cut her Well Gods nightgown let them do it Her chin went up and she smiled the corners of her eyes crinkling Before she could turn to speak to those nearest the door someone came through the press of people There was an odd hush that caught Scarletts heart Then through the lane came Melanie on small feet that hurried hurried to meet Scarlett at the door to speak to her before anyone else could speak Her narrow shoulders were squared and her small jaw set indignantly and for all her notice she might have had no other guest but Scarlett She went to her side and slipped an arm about her waist What a lovely dress darling she said in her small clear voice Will you be an angel India was unable to come tonight and assist me Will you receive with me CHAPTER LIV SAFE IN HER ROOM AGAIN Scarlett fell on the bed careless of her moir dress bustle and roses For a time she could only lie still and think of standing between Melanie and Ashley greeting guests What a horror She would face Shermans army again rather than repeat that performance After a time she rose from the bed and nervously paced the floor shedding garments as she walked Reaction from strain set in and she began to shake Hairpins slipped out of her fingers and tinkled to the floor and when she tried to give her hair its customary hundred strokes she banged the back of the brush hurtingly against her temple A dozen times she tiptoed to the door to listen for noises downstairs but the hall below lay like a black silent pit Rhett had sent her home alone in the carriage when the party was over and she had thanked God for the reprieve He had not come in yet Thank God he had not come in She could not face him tonight shamed frightened shaking But where was he Probably at that creatures place For the first time Scarlett was glad there was such a person as Belle Watling Glad there was some other place than this house to shelter Rhett until his glittering murderous mood had passed That was wrong being glad a husband was at the house of a prostitute but she could not help it She would be almost glad if he were dead if it meant she would not have to see him tonight Tomorrowwell tomorrow was another day Tomorrow she would think of some excuse some counter accusations some way of putting Rhett in the wrong Tomorrow the memory of this hideous night would not be driving her so fiercely that she shook Tomorrow she would not be so haunted by the memory of Ashleys face his broken pride and his shameshame that she had caused shame in which he had so little part Would he hate her now her darling honorable Ashley because she had shamed him Of course he would hate her nownow that they had both been saved by the indignant squaring of Melanies thin shoulders and the love and outspoken trust which had been in her voice as she crossed the glassy floor to slip her arm through Scarletts and face the curious malicious covertly hostile crowd How neatly Melanie had scotched the scandal keeping Scarlett at her side all through the dreadful evening People had been a bit cool somewhat bewildered but they had been polite Oh the ignominy of it all to be sheltered behind Melanies skirts from those who hated her who would have torn her to bits with their whispers To be sheltered by Melanies blind trust Melanie of all people Scarlett shook as with a chill at the thought She must have a drink a number of drinks before she could lie down and hope to sleep She threw a wrapper about her gown and went hastily out into the dark hall her backless slippers making a great clatter in the stillness She was halfway down the stairs before she looked toward the closed door of the dining room and saw a narrow line of light streaming from under it Her heart stopped for a moment Had that light been burning when she came home and had she been too upset to notice it Or was Rhett home after all He could have come in quietly through the kitchen door If Rhett were home she would tiptoe back to bed without her brandy much as she needed it Then she wouldnt have to face him Once in her room she would be safe for she could lock the door She was leaning over to pluck off her slippers so she might hurry back in silence when the diningroom door swung open abruptly and Rhett stood silhouetted against the dim candlelight behind him He looked huge larger than she had ever seen him a terrifying faceless black bulk that swayed slightly on its feet Pray join me Mrs Butler he said and his voice was a little thick He was drunk and showing it and she had never before seen him show his liquor no matter how much he drank She paused irresolutely saying nothing and his arm went up in gesture of command Come here damn you he said roughly He must be very drunk she thought with a fluttering heart Usually the more he drank the more polished became his manners He sneered more his words were apt to be more biting but the manner that accompanied them was always punctilioustoo punctilious I must never let him know Im afraid to face him she thought and clutching the wrapper closer to her throat she went down the stairs with her head up and her heels clacking noisily He stood aside and bowed her through the door with a mockery that made her wince She saw that he was coatless and his cravat hung down on either side of his open collar His shirt was open down to the thick mat of black hair on his chest His hair was rumpled and his eyes bloodshot and narrow One candle burned on the table a tiny spark of light that threw monstrous shadows about the highceilinged room and made the massive sideboards and buffet look like still crouching beasts On the table on the silver tray stood the decanter with cutglass stopper out surrounded by glasses Sit down he said curtly following her into the room Now a new kind of fear crept into her a fear that made her alarm at facing him seem very small He looked and talked and acted like a stranger This was an illmannered Rhett she had never seen before Never at any time even in most intimate moments had he been other than nonchalant Even in anger he was suave and satirical and whisky usually served to intensify these qualities At first it had annoyed her and she had tried to break down that nonchalance but soon she had come to accept it as a very  Page    Gone With The Wind convenient thing For years she had thought that nothing mattered very much to him that he thought everything in life including her an ironic joke But as she faced him across the table she knew with a sinking feeling in her stomach that at last something was mattering to him mattering very much There is no reason why you should not have your nightcap even if I am ill bred enough to be at home he said Shall I pour it for you I did not want a drink she said stiffly I heard a noise and came You heard nothing You wouldnt have come down if youd thought I was home Ive sat here and listened to you racing up and down the floor upstairs You must need a drink badly Take it I do not He picked up the decanter and sloshed a glassful untidily Take it he said shoving it into her hand You are shaking all over Oh dont give yourself airs I know you drink on the quiet and I know how much you drink For some time Ive been intending to tell you to stop your elaborate pretenses and drink openly if you want to Do you think I give a damn if you like your brandy She took the wet glass silently cursing him He read her like a book He had always read her and he was the one man in the world from whom she would like to hide her real thoughts Drink it I say She raised the glass and bolted the contents with one abrupt motion of her arm wrist stiff just as Gerald had always taken his neat whisky bolted it before she thought how practiced and unbecoming it looked He did not miss the gesture and his mouth went down at the corner Sit down and we will have a pleasant domestic discussion of the elegant reception we have just attended You are drunk she said coldly and I am going to bed I am very drunk and I intend to get still drunker before the evenings over But you arent going to bednot yet Sit down His voice still held a remnant of its wonted cool drawl but beneath the words she could feel violence fighting its way to the surface violence as cruel as the crack of a whip She wavered irresolutely and he was at her side his hand on her arm in a grip that hurt He gave it a slight wrench and she hastily sat down with a little cry of pain Now she was afraid more afraid than she had ever been in her life As he leaned over her she saw that his face was dark and flushed and his eyes still held their frightening glitter There was something in their depths she did not recognize could not understand something deeper than anger stronger than pain something driving him until his eyes glowed redly like twin coals He looked down at her for a long time so long that her defiant gaze wavered and fell and then he slumped into a chair opposite her and poured himself another drink She thought rapidly trying to lay a line of defenses But until he spoke she would not know what to say for she did not know exactly what accusation he intended to make He drank slowly watching her over the glass and she tightened her nerves trying to keep from trembling For a time his face did not change its expression but finally he laughed still keeping his eyes on her and at the sound she could not still her shaking It was an amusing comedy this evening wasnt it She said nothing curling her toes in the loose slippers in an effort at controlling her quivering A pleasant comedy with no character missing The village assembled to stone the erring woman the wronged husband supporting his wife as a gentleman should the wronged wife stepping in with Christian spirit and casting the garments of her spotless reputation over it all And the lover Please I dont please Not tonight Its too amusing And the lover looking like a damned fool and wishing he were dead How does it feel my dear to have the woman you hate stand by you and cloak your sins for you Sit down She sat down You dont like her any better for it I imagine You are wondering if she knows all about you and Ashleywondering why she did this if she does knowif she just did it to save her own face And you are thinking shes a fool for doing it even if it did save your hide but I will not listen Yes you will listen And Ill tell you this to ease your worry Miss Melly is a fool but not the kind you think It was obvious that someone had told her but she didnt believe it Even if she saw she wouldnt believe Theres too much honor in her to conceive of dishonor in anyone she loves I dont know what lie Ashley Wilkes told herbut any clumsy one would do for she loves Ashley and she loves you Im sure I cant see why she loves you but she does Let that be one of your crosses If you were not so drunk and insulting I would explain everything said Scarlett recovering some dignity But now I am not interested in your explanations I know the truth better than you do By God if you get up out of that chair just once more And what I find more amusing than even tonights comedy is the fact that while you have been so virtuously denying me the pleasures of your bed because of my many sins you have been lusting in your heart after Ashley Wilkes Lusting in your heart Thats a good phrase isnt it There are a number of good phrases in that Book arent there What book What book her mind ran on foolishly irrelevantly as she cast frantic eyes about the room noting how dully the massive silver gleamed in the dim light how frighteningly dark the corners were And I was cast out because my coarse ardors were too much for your refinementbecause you didnt want any more children How bad that made me feel dear heart How it cut me So I went out and found pleasant consolation and left you to your refinements And you spent that time tracking the longsuffering Mr Wilkes God damn him what ails him He cant be faithful to his wife with his mind or unfaithful with his body Why doesnt he make up his mind You wouldnt object to having his children would youand passing them off as mine She sprang to her feet with a cry and he lunged from his seat laughing that soft laugh that made her blood cold He pressed her back into her chair with large brown hands and leaned over her  Page    Gone With The Wind Observe my hands my dear he said flexing them before her eyes I could tear you to pieces with them with no trouble whatsoever and I would do it if it would take Ashley out of your mind But it wouldnt So I think Ill remove him from your mind forever this way Ill put my hands so on each side of your head and Ill smash your skull between them like a walnut and that will blot him out His hands were on her head under her flowing hair caressing hard turning her face up to his She was looking into the face of a stranger a drunken drawlingvoiced stranger She had never lacked animal courage and in the face of danger it flooded back hotly into her veins stiffening her spine narrowing her eyes You drunken fool she said Take your hands off me To her surprise he did so and seating himself on the edge of the table he poured himself another drink I have always admired your spirit my dear Never more than now when you are cornered She drew her wrapper close about her body Oh if she could only reach her room and turn the key in the stout door and be alone Somehow she must stand him off bully him into submission this Rhett she had never seen before She rose without haste though her knees shook tightened the wrapper across her hips and threw back her hair from her face Im not cornered she said cuttingly Youll never corner me Rhett Butler or frighten me You are nothing but a drunken beast whos been with bad women so long that you cant understand anything else but badness You cant understand Ashley or me Youve lived in dirt too long to know anything else You are jealous of something you cant understand Good night She turned casually and started toward the door and a burst of laughter stopped her She turned and he swayed across the room toward her Name of God if he would only stop that terrible laugh What was there to laugh about in all of this As he came toward her she backed toward the door and found herself against the wall He put his hands heavily upon her and pinned her shoulders to the wall Stop laughing I am laughing because I am so sorry for you Sorryfor me Be sorry for yourself Yes by God Im sorry for you my dear my pretty little fool That hurts doesnt it You cant stand either laughter or pity can you He stopped laughing leaning so heavily against her shoulders that they ached His face changed and he leaned so close to her that the heavy whisky smell of his breath made her turn her head Jealous am I he said And why not Oh yes Im jealous of Ashley Wilkes Why not Oh dont try to talk and explain I know youve been physically faithful to me Was that what you were trying to say Oh Ive known that all along All these years How do I know Oh well I know Ashley Wilkes and his breed I know he is honorable and a gentleman And that my dear is more than I can say for youor for me for that matter We are not gentlemen and we have no honor have we Thats why we flourish like green bay trees Let me go I wont stand here and be insulted Im not insulting you Im praising your physical virtue And it hasnt fooled me one bit You think men are such fools Scarlett It never pays to underestimate your opponents strength and intelligence And Im not a fool Dont you suppose I know that youve lain in my arms and pretended I was Ashley Wilkes Her jaw dropped and fear and astonishment were written plainly in her face Pleasant thing that Rather ghostly in fact Like having three in a bed where there ought to be just two He shook her shoulders ever so slightly hiccoughed and smiled mockingly Oh yes youve been faithful to me because Ashley wouldnt have you But hell I wouldnt have grudged him your body I know how little bodies meanespecially womens bodies But I do grudge him your heart and your dear hard unscrupulous stubborn mind He doesnt want your mind the fool and I dont want your body I can buy women cheap But I do want your mind and your heart and Ill never have them any more than youll ever have Ashleys mind And thats why Im sorry for you Even through her fear and bewilderment his sneer stung Sorryfor me Yes sorry because youre such a child Scarlett A child crying for the moon What would a child do with the moon if it got it And what would you do with Ashley Yes Im sorry for yousorry to see you throwing away happiness with both hands and reaching out for something that would never make you happy Im sorry because you are such a fool you dont know there cant ever be happiness except when like mates like If I were dead if Miss Melly were dead and you had your precious honorable lover do you think youd be happy with him Hell no You would never know him never know what he was thinking about never understand him any more than you understand music and poetry and books or anything that isnt dollars and cents Whereas we dear wife of my bosom could have been perfectly happy if you had ever given us half a chance for we are so much alike We are both scoundrels Scarlett and nothing is beyond us when we want something We could have been happy for I loved you and I know you Scarlett down to your bones in a way that Ashley could never know you And he would despise you if he did know  But no you must go mooning all your life after a man you cannot understand And I my darling will continue to moon after whores And I dare say well do better than most couples He released her abruptly and made a weaving way back toward the decanter For a moment Scarlett stood rooted thoughts tearing in and out of her mind so swiftly that she could seize none of them long enough to examine them Rhett had said he loved her Did he mean it Or was he merely drunk Or was this one of his horrible jokes And Ashleythe mooncrying for the moon She ran swiftly into the dark hall fleeing as though demons were upon her Oh if she could only reach her room She turned her ankle and the slipper fell half off As she stopped to kick it loose frantically Rhett running lightly as an Indian was beside her in the dark His breath was not on her face and his hands went round her roughly under the wrapper against her bare skin You turned me out on the town while you chased him By God this is one night when there are only going to be two in my bed  Page    Gone With The Wind He swung her off her feet into his arms and started up the stairs Her head was crushed against his chest and she heard the hard hammering of his heart beneath her ears He hurt her and she cried out muffled frightened Up the stairs he went in the utter darkness up up and she was wild with fear He was a mad stranger and this was a black darkness she did not know darker than death He was like death carrying her away in arms that hurt She screamed stifled against him and he stopped suddenly on the landing and turning her swiftly in his arms bent over and kissed her with a savagery and a completeness that wiped out everything from her mind but the dark into which she was sinking and the lips on hers He was shaking as though he stood in a strong wind and his lips traveling from her mouth downward to where the wrapper had fallen from her body fell on her soft flesh He was muttering things she did not hear his lips were evoking feelings never felt before She was darkness and he was darkness and there had never been anything before this time only darkness and his lips upon her She tried to speak and his mouth was over hers again Suddenly she had a wild thrill such as she had never known joy fear madness excitement surrender to arms that were too strong lips too bruising fate that moved too fast For the first time in her life she had met someone something stronger than she someone she could neither bully nor break someone who was bullying and breaking her Somehow her arms were around his neck and her lips trembling beneath his and they were going up up into the darkness again a darkness that was soft and swirling and all enveloping When she awoke the next morning he was gone and had it not been for the rumpled pillow beside her she would have thought the happenings of the night before a wild preposterous dream She went crimson at the memory and pulling the bed covers up about her neck lay bathed in sunlight trying to sort out the jumbled impressions in her mind Two things stood to the fore She had lived for years with Rhett slept with him eaten with him quarreled with him and borne his childand yet she did not know him The man who had carried her up the dark stairs was a stranger of whose existence she had not dreamed And now though she tried to make herself hate him tried to be indignant she could not He had humbled her hurt her used her brutally through a wild mad night and she had gloried in it Oh she should be ashamed should shrink from the very memory of the hot swirling darkness A lady a real lady could never hold up her head after such a night But stronger than shame was the memory of rapture of the ecstasy of surrender For the first time in her life she had felt alive felt passion as sweeping and primitive as the fear she had known the night she fled Atlanta as dizzy sweet as the cold hate when she had shot the Yankee Rhett loved her At least he said he loved her and how could she doubt it now How odd and bewildering and how incredible that he loved her this savage stranger with whom she had lived in such coolness She was not altogether certain how she felt about this revelation but as an idea came to her she suddenly laughed aloud He loved her and so she had him at last She had almost forgotten her early desire to entrap him into loving her so she could hold the whip over his insolent black head Now it came back and it gave her great satisfaction For one night he had had her at his mercy but now she knew the weakness of his armor From now on she had him where she wanted him She had smarted under his jeers for a long time but now she had him where she could make him jump through any hoops she cared to hold When she thought of meeting him again face to face in the sober light of day a nervous tingling embarrassment that carried with it an exciting pleasure enveloped her Im nervous as a bride she thought And about Rhett And at the idea she fell to giggling foolishly But Rhett did not appear for dinner nor was he at his place at the supper table The night passed a long night during which she lay awake until dawn her ears strained to hear his key in the latch But he did not come When the second day passed with no word from him she was frantic with disappointment and fear She went by the bank but he was not there She went to the store and was very sharp with everyone for every time the door opened to admit a customer she looked up with a flutter hoping it was Rhett She went to the lumber yard and bullied Hugh until he hid himself behind a pile of lumber But Rhett did not seek her there She could not humble herself to ask friends if they had seen him She could not make inquiries among the servants for news of him But she felt they knew something she did not know Negroes always knew everything Mammy was unusually silent those two days She watched Scarlett out of the corner of her eye and said nothing When the second night had passed Scarlett made up her mind to go to the police Perhaps he had had an accident perhaps his horse had thrown him and he was lying helpless in some ditch Perhapsoh horrible thoughtperhaps he was dead The next morning when she had finished her breakfast and was in her room putting on her bonnet she heard swift feet on the stairs As she sank to the bed in weak thankfulness Rhett entered the room He was freshly barbered shaved and massaged and he was sober but his eyes were bloodshot and his face puffy from drink He waved an airy hand at her and said Oh hello How could a man say Oh hello after being gone without explanation for two days How could he be so nonchalant with the memory of such a night as they had spent He couldnt unlessunlessthe terrible thought leaped into her mind Unless such nights were the usual thing to him For a moment she could not speak and all the pretty gestures and smiles she had thought to use upon him were forgotten He did not even come to her to give her his usual offhand kiss but stood looking at her with a grin a smoking cigar in his hand Wherewhere have you been Dont tell me you dont know I thought surely the whole town knew by now Perhaps they all do except you You know the old adage The wife is always the last one to find out  What do you mean I thought that after the police called at Belles night before last Bellesthatthat woman You have been with Of course Where else would I be I hope you havent worried about me You went from me tooh Come come Scarlett Dont play the deceived wife You must have known about Belle long ago You went to her from me afterafter  Page    Gone With The Wind Oh that He made a careless gesture I will forget my manners My apologies for my conduct at our last meeting I was very drunk as you doubtless know and quite swept off my feet by your charmsneed I enumerate them Suddenly she wanted to cry to lie down on the bed and sob endlessly He hadnt changed nothing had changed and she had been a fool a stupid conceited silly fool thinking he loved her It had all been one of his repulsive drunken jests He had taken her and used her when he was drunk just as he would use any woman in Belles house And now he was back insulting sardonic out of reach She swallowed her tears and rallied He must never never know what she had thought How he would laugh if he knew Well hed never know She looked up quickly at him and caught that old puzzling watchful glint in his eyeskeen eager as though he hung on her next words hoping they would bewhat was he hoping That shed make a fool out of herself and bawl and give him something to laugh about Not she Her slanting brows rushed together in a cold frown I had naturally suspected what your relations with that creature were Only suspected Why didnt you ask me and satisfy your curiosity Id have told you Ive been living with her ever since the day you and Ashley Wilkes decided that we should have separate bedrooms You have the gall to stand there and boast to me your wife that Oh spare me your moral indignation You never gave a damn what I did as long as I paid the bills And you know Ive been no angel recently And as for you being my wifeyou havent been much of a wife since Bonnie came have you Youve been a poor investment Scarlett Belles been a better one Investment You mean you gave her  Set her up in business is the correct term I believe Belles a smart woman I wanted to see her get ahead and all she needed was money to start a house of her own You ought to know what miracles a woman can perform when she has a bit of cash Look at yourself You compare me Well you are both hardheaded business women and both successful Belles got the edge on you of course because shes a kindhearted goodnatured soul Will you get out of this room He lounged toward the door one eyebrow raised quizzically How could he insult her so she thought in rage and pain He was going out of his way to hurt and humiliate her and she writhed as she thought how she had longed for his homecoming while all the time he was drunk and brawling with police in a bawdy house Get out of this room and dont ever come back in it I told you that once before and you werent enough of a gentleman to understand Hereafter I will lock my door Dont bother I will lock it After the way you acted the other nightso drunk so disgusting Come now darling Not disgusting surely Get out Dont worry Im going And I promise Ill never bother you again Thats final And I just thought Id tell you that if my infamous conduct was too much for you to bear Ill let you have a divorce Just give me Bonnie and I wont contest it I would not think of disgracing the family with a divorce Youd disgrace it quick enough if Miss Melly was dead wouldnt you It makes my head spin to think how quickly youd divorce me Will you go Yes Im going Thats what I came home to tell you Im going to Charleston and New Orleans andoh well a very extended trip Im leaving today Oh And Im taking Bonnie with me Get that foolish Prissy to pack her little duds Ill take Prissy too Youll never take my child out of this house My child too Mrs Butler Surely you do not mind me taking her to Charleston to see her grandmother Her grandmother my foot Do you think Ill let you take that baby out of here when youll be drunk every night and most likely taking her to houses like that Belles He threw down the cigar violently and it smoked acridly on the carpet the smell of scorching wool rising to their nostrils In an instant he was across the floor and by her side his face black with fury If you were a man I would break your neck for that As it is all I can say is for you to shut your Goddamn mouth Do you think I do not love Bonnie that I would take her wheremy daughter Good God you fool And as for you giving yourself pious airs about your motherhood why a cats a better mother than you What have you ever done for the children Wade and Ella are frightened to death of you and if it wasnt for Melanie Wilkes theyd never know what love and affection are But Bonnie my Bonnie Do you think I cant take better care of her than you Do you think Ill ever let you bully her and break her spirit as youve broken Wades and Ellas Hell no Have her packed up and ready for me in an hour or I warn you what happened the other night will be mild beside what will happen Ive always thought a good lashing with a buggy whip would benefit you immensely He turned on his heel before she could speak and went out of the room on swift feet She heard him cross the floor of the hall to the childrens play room and open the door There was a glad quick treble of childish voices and she heard Bonnies tones rise over Ellas Daddy where you been Hunting for a rabbits skin to wrap my little Bonnie in Give your best sweetheart a kiss Bonnieand you too Ella CHAPTER LV  Page    Gone With The Wind DARLING I dont want any explanation from you and I wont listen to one said Melanie firmly as she gently laid a small hand across Scarletts tortured lips and stilled her words You insult yourself and Ashley and me by even thinking there could be need of explanations between us Why we three have beenhave been like soldiers fighting the world together for so many years that Im ashamed of you for thinking idle gossip could come between us Do you think Id believe that you and my Ashley Why the idea Dont you realize I know you better than anyone in the world knows you Do you think Ive forgotten all the wonderful unselfish things youve done for Ashley and Beau and meeverything from saving my life to keeping us from starving Do you think I could remember you walking in a furrow behind that Yankees horse almost barefooted and with your hands blisteredjust so the baby and I could have something to eatand then believe such dreadful things about you I dont want to hear a word out of you Scarlett OHara Not a word But Scarlett fumbled and stopped Rhett had left town the hour before with Bonnie and Prissy and desolation was added to Scarletts shame and anger The additional burden of her guilt with Ashley and Melanies defense was more than she could bear Had Melanie believed India and Archie cut her at the reception or even greeted her frigidly then she could have held her head high and fought back with every weapon in her armory But now with the memory of Melanie standing between her and social ruin standing like a thin shining blade with trust and a fighting light in her eyes there seemed nothing honest to do but confess Yes blurt out everything from that faroff beginning on the sunny porch at Tara She was driven by a conscience which though long suppressed could still rise up an active Catholic conscience Confess your sins and do penance for them in sorrow and contrition Ellen had told her a hundred times and in this crisis Ellens religious training came back and gripped her She would confessyes everything every look and word those few caressesand then God would ease her pain and give her peace And for her penance there would be the dreadful sight of Melanies face changing from fond love and trust to incredulous horror and repulsion Oh that was too hard a penance she thought in anguish to have to live out her life remembering Melanies face knowing that Melanie knew all the pettiness the meanness the twofaced disloyalty and the hypocrisy that were in her Once the thought of flinging the truth tauntingly in Melanies face and seeing the collapse of her fools paradise had been an intoxicating one a gesture worth everything she might lose thereby But now all that had changed overnight and there was nothing she desired less Why this should be she did not know There was too great a tumult of conflicting ideas in her mind for her to sort them out She only knew that as she had once desired to keep her mother thinking her modest kind pure of heart so she now passionately desired to keep Melanies high opinion She only knew that she did not care what the world thought of her or what Ashley or Rhett thought of her but Melanie must not think her other than she had always thought her She dreaded to tell Melanie the truth but one of her rare honest instincts arose an instinct that would not let her masquerade in false colors before the woman who had fought her battles for her So she had hurried to Melanie that morning as soon as Rhett and Bonnie had left the house But at her first tumbledout words Melly I must explain about the other day Melanie had imperiously stopped her Scarlett looking shamefaced into the dark eyes that were flashing with love and anger knew with a sinking heart that the peace and calm following confession could never be hers Melanie had forever cut off that line of action by her first words With one of the few adult emotions Scarlett had ever had she realized that to unburden her own tortured heart would be the purest selfishness She would be ridding herself of her burden and laying it on the heart of an innocent and trusting person She owed Melanie a debt for her championship and that debt could only be paid with silence What cruel payment it would be to wreck Melanies life with the unwelcome knowledge that her husband was unfaithful to her and her beloved friend a party to it I cant tell her she thought miserably Never not even if my conscience kills me She remembered irrelevantly Rhetts drunken remark She cant conceive of dishonor in anyone she loves  let that be your cross Yes it would be her cross until she died to keep this torment silent within her to wear the hair shirt of shame to feel it chafing her at every tender look and gesture Melanie would make throughout the years to subdue forever the impulse to cry Dont be so kind Dont fight for me Im not worth it If you only werent such a fool such a sweet trusting simpleminded fool it wouldnt be so hard she thought desperately Ive toted lots of weary loads but this is going to be the heaviest and most galling load Ive ever toted Melanie sat facing her in a low chair her feet firmly planted on an ottoman so high that her knees stuck up like a childs a posture she would never now assumed had not rage possessed her to the point of forgetting proprieties She held a line of tatting in her hands and she was driving the shining needle back and forth as furiously as though handling a rapier in a duel Had Scarlett been possessed of such an anger she would have been stamping both feet and roaring like Gerald in his finest days calling on God to witness the accursed duplicity and knavishness of mankind and uttering bloodcurdling threats of retaliation But only by the flashing needle and the delicate brows drawn down toward her nose did Melanie indicate that she was inwardly seething Her voice was cool and her words were more close clipped than usual But the forceful words she uttered were foreign to Melanie who seldom voiced an opinion at all and never an unkind word Scarlett realized suddenly that the Wilkeses and the Hamiltons were capable of furies equal to and surpassing those of the OHaras Ive gotten mighty tired of hearing people criticize you darling Melanie said and this is the last straw and Im going to do something about it All this has happened because people are jealous of you because you are so smart and successful Youve succeeded where lots of men even have failed Now dont be vexed with me dear for saying that I dont mean youve ever been unwomanly or unsexed yourself as lots of folks have said Because you havent People just dont understand you and people cant bear for women to be smart But your smartness and your success dont give people the right to say that you and Ashley Stars above The soft vehemence of this last ejaculation would have been upon a mans lips profanity of no uncertain meaning Scarlett stared at her alarmed by so unprecedented an outburst And for them to come to me with the filthy lies theyd concoctedArchie India Mrs Elsing How did they dare Of course Mrs Elsing didnt come here No indeed she didnt have the courage But shes always hated you darling because you were  Page    Gone With The Wind more popular than Fanny And she was so incensed at your demoting Hugh from the management of the mill But you were quite right in demoting him Hes just a piddling doless goodfornothing Swiftly Melanie dismissed the playmate of her childhood and the beau of her teen years I blame myself about Archie I shouldnt have given the old scoundrel shelter Everyone told me so but I wouldnt listen He didnt like you dear because of the convicts but who is he to criticize you A murderer and the murderer of a woman too And after all Ive done for him he comes to me and tells me I shouldnt have been a bit sorry if Ashley had shot him Well I packed him off with a large flea in his ear I can tell you And hes left town And as for India the vile thing Darling I couldnt help noticing from the first time I saw you two together that she was jealous of you and hated you because you were so much prettier and had so many beaux And she hated you especially about Stuart Tarleton And shes brooded about Stuart so much thatwell I hate to say it about Ashleys sister but I think her mind has broken with thinking so much Theres no other explanation for her action  I told her never to put foot in this house again and that if I heard her breathe so vile an insinuation I wouldI would call her a liar in public Melanie stopped speaking and abruptly the anger left her face and sorrow swamped it Melanie had all that passionate clan loyalty peculiar to Georgians and the thought of a family quarrel tore her heart She faltered for a moment But Scarlett was dearest Scarlett came first in her heart and she went on loyally Shes always been jealous because I loved you best dear Shell never come in this house again and Ill never put foot under any roof that receives her Ashley agrees with me but its just about broken his heart that his own sister should tell such a At the mention of Ashleys name Scarletts overwrought nerves gave way and she burst into tears Would she never stop stabbing him to the heart Her only thought had been to make him happy and safe but at every turn she seemed to hurt him She had wrecked his life broken his pride and selfrespect shattered that inner peace that calm based on integrity And now she had alienated him from the sister he loved so dearly To save her own reputation and his wifes happiness India had to be sacrificed forced into the light of a lying halfcrazed jealous old maidIndia who was absolutely justified in every suspicion she had ever harbored and every accusing word she had uttered Whenever Ashley looked into Indias eyes he would see the truth shining there truth and reproach and the cold contempt of which the Wilkeses were masters Knowing how Ashley valued honor above his life Scarlett knew he must be writhing He like Scarlett was forced to shelter behind Melanies skirts While Scarlett realized the necessity for this and knew that the blame for his false position lay mostly at her own door stillstill Womanlike she would have respected Ashley more had he shot Archie and admitted everything to Melanie and the world She knew she was being unfair but she was too miserable to care for such fine points Some of Rhetts taunting words of contempt came back to her and she wondered if indeed Ashley had played the manly part in this mess And for the first time some of the bright glow which had enveloped him since the first day she fell in love with him began to fade imperceptibly The tarnish of shame and guilt that enveloped her spread to him as well Resolutely she tried to fight off this thought but it only made her cry harder Dont Dont cried Melanie dropping her tatting and flinging herself onto the sofa and drawing Scarletts head down onto her shoulder I shouldnt have talked about it all and distressed you so I know how dreadfully you must feel and well never mention it again No not to each other or to anybody Itll be as though it never happened But she added with quiet venom Im going to show India and Mrs Elsing whats what They neednt think they can spread lies about my husband and my sisterinlaw Im going to fix it so neither of them can hold up their heads in Atlanta And anybody who believes them or re ceives them is my enemy Scarlett looking sorrowfully down the long vista of years to come knew that she was the cause of a feud that would split the town and the family for generations Melanie was as good as her word She never again mentioned the subject to Scarlett or to Ashley Nor for that matter would she discuss it with anyone She maintained an air of cool indifference that could speedily change to icy formality if anyone even dared hint about the matter During the weeks that followed her surprise party while Rhett was mysteriously absent and the town in a frenzied state of gossip excitement and partisanship she gave no quarter to Scarletts detractors whether they were her old friends or her blood kin She did not speak she acted She stuck by Scarletts side like a cocklebur She made Scarlett go to the store and the lumber yard as usual every morning and she went with her She insisted that Scarlett go driving in the afternoons little though Scarlett wished to expose herself to the eager carious gaze of her fellow townspeople And Melanie sat in the carriage beside her Melanie took her calling with her on formal afternoons gently forcing her into parlors in which Scarlett had not sat for more than two years And Melanie with a fierce lovemelovemydog look on her face made converse with astounded hostesses She made Scarlett arrive early on these afternoons and remain until the last callers had gone thereby depriving the ladies of the opportunity for enjoyable group discussion and speculation a matter which caused some mild indignation These calls were an especial torment to Scarlett but she dared not refuse to go with Melanie She hated to sit amid crowds of women who were secretly wondering if she had been actually taken in adultery She hated the knowledge that these women would not have spoken to her had it not been that they loved Melanie and did not want to lose her friendship But Scarlett knew that having once received her they could not cut her thereafter It was characteristic of the regard in which Scarlett was held that few people based their defense or their criticism of her on her personal integrity I wouldnt put much beyond her was the universal attitude Scarlett had made too many enemies to have many champions now Her words and her actions rankled in too many hearts for many people to care whether this scandal hurt her or not But everyone cared violently about hurting Melanie or India and the storm revolved around them rather than Scarlett centering upon the one questionDid India lie Those who espoused Melanies side pointed triumphantly to the fact that Melanie was constantly with Scarlett these days Would a woman of Melanies high principles champion the cause of a guilty woman especially a woman guilty with her own husband No indeed India was just a cracked old maid who hated Scarlett and lied about her and induced Archie and Mrs Elsing to believe her lies  Page    Gone With The Wind But questioned Indias adherents if Scarlett isnt guilty where is Captain Butler Why isnt he here at his wifes side lending her the strength of his countenance That was an unanswerable question and as the weeks went by and the rumor spread that Scarlett was pregnant the proIndia group nodded with satisfaction It couldnt be Captain Butlers baby they said For too long the fact of their estrangement had been public property For too long the town had been scandalized by the separate bedrooms So the gossip ran tearing the town apart tearing apart too the closeknit clan of Hamiltons Wilkeses Burrs Whitemans and Winfields Everyone in the family connection was forced to take sides There was no neutral ground Melanie with cool dignity and India with acid bitterness saw to that But no matter which side the relatives took they all were resentful that Scarlett should have been the cause of the family breach None of them thought her worth it And no matter which side they took the relatives heartily deplored the fact that India had taken it upon herself to wash the family dirty linen so publicly and involve Ashley in so degrading a scandal But now that she had spoken many rushed to her defense and took her side against Scarlett even as others loving Melanie stood by her and Scarlett Half of Atlanta was kin to or claimed kin with Melanie and India The ramifications of cousins double cousins cousinsinlaw and kissing cousins were so intricate and involved that no one but a born Georgian could ever unravel them They had always been a clannish tribe presenting an unbroken phalanx of overlapping shields to the world in time of stress no matter what their private opinions of the conduct of individual kinsmen might be With the exception of the guerrilla warfare carried on by Aunt Pitty against Uncle Henry which had been a matter for hilarious laughter within the family for years there had never been an open breach in the pleasant relations They were gentle quiet spoken reserved people and not given to even the amiable bickering that characterized most Atlanta families But now they were split in twain and the town was privileged to witness cousins of the fifth and sixth degree taking sides in the most shattering scandal Atlanta had ever seen This worked great hardship and strained the tact and forbearance of the unrelated half of the town for the IndiaMelanie feud made a rupture in practically every social organization The Thalians the Sewing Circle for the Widows and Orphans of the Confederacy the Association for the Beautification of the Graves of Our Glorious Dead the Saturday Night Musical Circle the Ladies Evening Cotillion Society the Young Mens Library were all involved So were four churches with their Ladies Aid and Missionary societies Great care had to be taken to avoid putting members of warring factions on the same committees On their regular afternoons at home Atlanta matrons were in anguish from four to six oclock for fear Melanie and Scarlett would call at the same time India and her loyal kin were in their parlors Of all the family poor Aunt Pitty suffered the most Pitty who desired nothing except to live comfortably amid the love of her relatives would have been very pleased in this matter to run with the hares and hunt with the hounds But neither the hares nor the hounds would permit this India lived with Aunt Pitty and if Pitty sided with Melanie as she wished to do India would leave And if India left her what would poor Pitty do then She could not live alone She would have to get a stranger to live with her or she would have to close up her house and go and live with Scarlett Aunt Pitty felt vaguely that Captain Butler would not care for this Or she would have to go and live with Melanie and sleep in the little cubbyhole that was Beaus nursery Pitty was not overly fond of India for India intimidated her with her dry stiffnecked ways and her passionate convictions But she made it possible for Pitty to keep her own comfortable establishment and Pitty was always swayed more by considerations of personal comfort than by moral issues And so India remained But her presence in the house made Aunt Pitty a storm center for both Scarlett and Melanie took that to mean that she sided with India Scarlett curtly refused to contribute more money to Pittys establishment as long as India was under the same roof Ashley sent India money every week and every week India proudly and silently returned it much to the old ladys alarm and regret Finances at the redbrick house would have been in a deplorable state but for Uncle Henrys intervention and it humil iated Pitty to take money from him Pitty loved Melanie better than anyone in the world except herself and now Melly acted like a cool polite stranger Though she practically lived in Pittys back yard she never once came through the hedge and she used to run in and out a dozen times a day Pitty called on her and wept and protested her love and devotion but Melanie always refused to discuss matters and never returned the calls Pitty knew very well what she owed Scarlettalmost her very existence Certainly in those black days after the war when Pitty was faced with the alternative of Brother Henry or starvation Scarlett had kept her home for her fed her clothed her and enabled her to hold up her head in Atlanta society And since Scarlett had married and moved into her own home she had been generosity itself And that frightening fascinating Captain Butlerfrequently after he called with Scarlett Pitty found brandnew purses stuffed with bills on her console table or lace handkerchiefs knotted about gold pieces which had been slyly slipped into her sewing box Rhett always vowed he knew nothing about them and accused her in a very unrefined way of having a secret admirer usually the bewhiskered Grandpa Merriwether Yes Pitty owed love to Melanie security to Scarlett and what did she owe India Nothing except that Indias presence kept her from having to break up her pleasant life and make decisions for herself It was all most distressing and too too vulgar and Pitty who had never made a decision for herself in her whole life simply let matters go on as they were and as a result spent much time in uncomforted tears In the end some people believed wholeheartedly in Scarletts innocence not because of her own personal virtue but because Melanie believed in it Some had mental reservations but they were courteous to Scarlett and called on her because they loved Melanie and wished to keep her love Indias adherents bowed coldly and some few cut her openly These last were embarrassing infuriating but Scarlett realized that except for Melanies championship and her quick action the face of the whole town would have been set against her and she would have been an outcast CHAPTER LVI  Page    Gone With The Wind RHETT WAS GONE for three months and during that time Scarlett had no word from him She did not know where he was or how long he would be gone Indeed she had no idea if he would ever return During this time she went about her business with her head high and her heart sick She did not feel well physically but forced by Melanie she went to the store every day and tried to keep up a superficial interest in the mills But the store palled on her for the first time and although the business was treble what it had been the year before and the money rolling in she could take no interest in it and was sharp and cross with the clerks Johnnie Galleghers mill was thriving and the lumber yard selling all his supply easily but nothing Johnnie did or said pleased her Johnnie as Irish as she finally erupted into rage at her naggings and threatened to quit after a long tirade which ended with and the back of both me hands to you Mam and the curse of Cromwell on you She had to appease him with the most abject of apologies She never went to Ashleys mill Nor did she go to the lumberyard office when she thought he would be there She knew he was avoiding her knew that her constant presence in his house at Melanies inescapable invitations was a torment to him They never spoke alone and she was desperate to question him She wanted to know whether he now hated her and exactly what he had told Melanie but he held her at arms length and silently pleaded with her not to speak The sight of his face old haggard with remorse added to her load and the fact that his mill lost money every week was an extra irritant which she could not voice His helplessness in the face of the present situation irked her She did not know what he could do to better matters but she felt that he should do something Rhett would have done something Rhett always did something even if it was the wrong thing and she unwillingly respected him for it Now that her first rage at Rhett and his insults had passed she began to miss him and she missed him more and more as days went by without news of him Out of the welter of rapture and anger and heartbreak and hurt pride that he had left depression emerged to sit upon her shoulder like a carrion crow She missed him missed his light flippant touch in anecdotes that made her shout with laughter his sardonic grin that reduced troubles to their proper proportions missed even his jeers that stung her to angry retort Most of all she missed having him to tell things to Rhett was so satisfactory in that respect She could recount shamelessly and with pride how she had skinned people out of their eyeteeth and he would applaud And if she even mentioned such things to other people they were shocked She was lonely without him and Bonnie She missed the child more than she had thought possible Remembering the last harsh words Rhett had hurled at her about Wade and Ella she tried to fill in some of her empty hours with them But it was no use Rhetts words and the childrens reactions opened her eyes to a startling a galling truth During the babyhood of each child she had been too busy too worried with money matters too sharp and easily vexed to win their confidence or affection And now it was either too late or she did not have the patience or the wisdom to penetrate their small secretive hearts Ella It annoyed Scarlett to realize that Ella was a silly child but she undoubtedly was She couldnt keep her little mind on one subject any longer than a bud could stay on one twig and even when Scarlett tried to tell her stories Ella went off at childish tangents interrupting with questions about matters that had nothing to do with the story and forgetting what she had asked long before Scarlett could get the explanation out of her mouth And as for Wadeperhaps Rhett was right Perhaps he was afraid of her That was odd and it hurt her Why should her own boy her only boy be afraid of her When she tried to draw him out in talk he looked at her with Charles soft brown eyes and squirmed and twisted his feet in embarrassment But with Melanie he bubbled over with talk and brought from his pocket everything from fishing worms to old strings to show her Melanie had a way with brats There was no getting around it Her own little Beau was the best behaved and most lovable child in Atlanta Scarlett got on better with him than she did with her own son because little Beau had no selfconsciousness where grown people were concerned and climbed on her knee uninvited whenever he saw her What a beautiful blond boy he was just like Ashley Now if only Wade were like Beau Of course the reason Melanie could do so much with him was that she had only one child and she hadnt had to worry and work as Scarlett had At least Scarlett tried to excuse herself that way but honesty forced her to admit that Melanie loved children and would have welcomed a dozen And the overbrimming affection she had was poured out on Wade and the neighbors broods Scarlett would never forget the shock of the day she drove by Melanies house to pick up Wade and heard as she came up the front walk the sound of her sons voice raised in a very fair imitation of the Rebel YellWade who was always as still as a mouse at home And manfully seconding Wades yell was the shrill piping of Beau When she had walked into the sitting room she had found the two charging at the sofa with wooden swords They had hushed abashed as she entered and Melanie had arisen laughing and clutching at hairpins and flying curls from where she was crouching behind the sofa Its Gettysburg she explained And Im the Yankees and Ive gotten the worst of it This is General Lee pointing to Beau and this is General Pickett putting an arm about Wades shoulder Yes Melanie had a way with children that Scarlett could never fathom At least she thought Bonnie loves me and likes to play with me But honesty forced her to admit that Bonnie infinitely preferred Rhett to her And perhaps she would never see Bonnie again For all she knew Rhett might be in Persia or Egypt and intending to stay there forever When Dr Meade told her she was pregnant she was astounded for she had been expecting a diagnosis of biliousness and overwrought nerves Then her mind fled back to that wild night and her face went crimson at the memory So a child was coming from those moments of high raptureeven if the memory of the rapture was dimmed by what followed And for the first time she was glad that she was going to have a child If it were only a boy A fine boy not a spiritless little creature like Wade How she would care for him Now that she had the leisure to devote to a baby and the money to smooth his path how happy she would be She had an impulse to write to Rhett in care of his mother in Charleston and tell him Good Heavens he must come home now Suppose he stayed away till after the baby was born She could never explain that But if she wrote him hed think she wanted him to come home and he would be amused And he mustnt ever think she wanted him or needed him She was very glad she had stifled this impulse when her first news of Rhett came in a letter from Aunt Pauline in Charleston where it seemed Rhett was visiting his mother What a relief to know he was still in the United States even if Aunt Paulines  Page    Gone With The Wind letter was infuriating Rhett had brought Bonnie to see her and Aunt Eulalie and the letter was full of praise Such a little beauty When she grows up she will certainly be a belle But I suppose you know that any man who courts her will have a tussle with Captain Butler for I never saw such a devoted father Now my dear I wish to confess something Until I met Captain Butler I felt that your marriage with him had been a dreadful mesalliance for of course no one in Charleston hears anything good about him and everyone is so sorry for his family In fact Eulalie and I were uncertain as to whether or not we should receive himbut after all the dear child is our greatniece When he came we were pleasantly surprised most pleasantly and realized how unChristian it is to credit idle gossip For he is most charming Quite handsome too we thought and so very grave and courteous And so devoted to you and the child And now my dear I must write you of something that has come to our earssomething Eulalie and I were loath to believe at first We had heard of course that you sometimes did about at the store that Mr Kennedy had left you We had heard rumors but of course we denied them We realized that in those first dreadful days after the war it was perhaps necessary conditions being what they were But there is no necessity now for such conduct on your part as I know Captain Butler is in quite comfortable circumstances and is moreover fully capable of managing for you any business and property you may own We had to know the truth of these rumors and were forced to ask Captain Butler pointblank questions which was most distressing to all of us With reluctance he told us that you spent your mornings at the store and would permit no one else to do the bookkeeping He also admitted that you had some interest in a mill or mills we did not press him on this being most upset at this information which was news to us that necessitated your riding about alone or attended by a ruffian who Captain Butler assures us is a murderer We could see how this wrung his heart and think he must be a most indulgentin fact a far too indulgent husband Scarlett this must stop Your mother is not here to command you and I must do it in her place Think how your little children will feel when they grow older and realize that you were in trade How mortified they will be to know that you exposed yourself to the insults of rude men and the dangers of careless gossip in attending to mills Such unwomanly Scarlett flung down the letter unfinished with an oath She could just see Aunt Pauline and Aunt Eulalie sitting in judgment on her in the crumbling house on the Battery with little between them and starvation except what she Scarlett sent them every month Unwomanly By God if she hadnt been unwomanly Aunt Pauline and Aunt Eulalie probably wouldnt have a roof over their heads this very moment And damn Rhett for telling them about the store and the bookkeeping and the mills Reluctant was he She knew very well the joy he took in palming himself off on the old ladies as grave courteous and charming the devoted husband and father How he must have loved harrowing them with descriptions of her activities with the store the mills the saloon What a devil he was Why did such perverse things give him such pleasure But soon even this rage passed into apathy So much of the keen zest had gone out of life recently If only she could recapture the thrill and the glow of Ashleyif only Rhett would come home and make her laugh They were home again without warning The first intimation of their return was the sound of luggage being thumped on the fronthall floor and Bonnies voice crying Mother Scarlett hurried from her room to the top of the stairs and saw her daughter stretching her short plump legs in an effort to climb the steps A resigned striped kitten was clutched to her breast Granma gave him to me she cried excitedly holding the kitten out by the scruff Scarlett swept her up into her arms and kissed her thankful that the childs presence spared her her first meeting alone with Rhett Looking over Bonnies head she saw him in the hall below paying the cab driver He looked up saw her and swept off his hat in a wide gesture bowing as he did When she met his dark eyes her heart leaped No matter what he was no matter what he had done he was home and she was glad Wheres Mammy asked Bonnie wriggling in Scarletts grasp and she reluctantly set the child on her feet It was going to be more difficult than she anticipated greeting Rhett with just the proper degree of casualness and as for telling him about the new baby She looked at his face as he came up the steps that dark nonchalant face so impervious so blank No shed wait to tell him She couldnt tell him right away And yet such tidings as these belonged first to a husband for a husband was always happy to hear them But she did not think he would be happy about it She stood on the landing leaning against the banisters and wondered if he would kiss her But he did not He said only You are looking pale Mrs Butler Is there a rouge shortage No word of missing her even if he didnt mean it And he might have at least kissed her in front of Mammy who after bobbing a curtsy was leading Bonnie away down the hall to the nursery He stood beside her on the landing his eyes appraising her carelessly Can this wanness mean that youve been missing me he questioned and though his lips smiled his eyes did not So that was going to be his attitude He was going to be as hateful as ever Suddenly the child she was carrying became a nauseating burden instead of something she had gladly carried and this man before her standing carelessly with his wide Panama hat upon his hip her bitterest foe the cause of all her troubles There was venom in her eyes as she answered venom that was too unmistakable to be missed and the smile went from his face If Im pale its your fault and not because Ive missed you you conceited thing Its because Oh she hadnt intended to tell him like this but the hot words rushed to her lips and she flung them at him careless of the servants who might hear Its because Im going to have a baby He sucked in his breath suddenly and his eyes went rapidly over her He took a quick step toward her as though to put a hand on her arm but she twisted away from him and before the hate in her eyes his face hardened Indeed he said coolly Well whos the happy father Ashley She clutched the newel post until the ears of the carved lion dug with sudden pain into her palm Even she who knew him so well had not anticipated this insult Of course he was joking but there were some jokes too monstrous to be borne She wanted to rake her sharp nails across his eyes and blot out that queer light in them Damn you she began her voice shaking with sick rage Youyou know its yours And I dont want it any more than you  Page    Gone With The Wind do Nono woman would want the children of a cad like you I wish Oh God I wish it was anybodys baby but yours She saw his swarthy face change suddenly anger and something she could not analyze making it twitch as though stung There she thought in a hot rage of pleasure There Ive hurt him now But the old impassive mask was back across his face and he stroked one side of his mustache Cheer up he said turning from her and starting up the stairs maybe youll have a miscarriage For a dizzy moment she thought what childbearing meant the nausea that tore her the tedious waiting the thickening of her figure the hours of pain Things no man could ever realize And he dared to joke She would claw him Nothing but the sight of blood upon his dark face would ease this pain in her heart She lunged for him swift as a cat but with a light startled movement he sidestepped throwing up his arm to ward her off She was standing on the edge of the freshly waxed top step and as her arm with the whole weight of her body behind it struck his outthrust arm she lost her balance She made a wild clutch for the newel post and missed it She went down the stairs backwards feeling a sickening dart of pain in her ribs as she landed And too dazed to catch herself she rolled over and over to the bottom of the flight It was the first time Scarlett had ever been ill except when she had her babies and somehow those times did not count She had not been forlorn and frightened then as she was now weak and pain racked and bewildered She knew she was sicker than they dared tell her feebly realized that she might die The broken rib stabbed when she breathed her bruised face and head ached and her whole body was given over to demons who plucked at her with hot pinchers and sawed on her with dull knives and left her for short intervals so drained of strength that she could not regain grip on herself before they returned No childbirth had not been like this She had been able to eat hearty meals two hours after Wade and Ella and Bonnie had been born but now the thought of anything but cool water brought on feeble nausea How easy it was to have a child and how painful not to have one Strange what a pang it had been even in her pain to know that she would not have this child Stranger still that it should have been the first child she really wanted She tried to think why she wanted it but her mind was too tired Her mind was too tired to think of anything except fear of death Death was in the room and she had no strength to confront it to fight it back and she was frightened She wanted someone strong to stand by her and hold her hand and fight off death until enough strength came back for her to do her own fighting Rage had been swallowed up in pain and she wanted Rhett But he was not there and she could not bring herself to ask for him Her last memory of him was how he looked as he picked her up in the dark hall at the bottom of the steps his face white and wiped clean of all save hideous fear his voice hoarsely calling for Mammy And then there was a faint memory of being carried upstairs before darkness came over her mind And then pain and more pain and the room full of buzzing voices and Aunt Pittypats sobs and Dr Meades brusque orders and feet that hurried on the stairs and tiptoes in the upper hall And then like a blinding ray of lightning the knowledge of death and fear that suddenly made her try to scream a name and the scream was only a whisper But that forlorn whisper brought instant response from somewhere in the darkness beside the bed and the soft voice of the one she called made answer in lullaby tones Im here dear Ive been right here all the time Death and fear receded gently as Melanie took her hand and laid it quietly against her cool cheek Scarlett tried to turn to see her face and could not Melly was having a baby and the Yankees were coming The town was afire and she must hurry hurry But Melly was having a baby and she couldnt hurry She must stay with her till the baby came and be strong because Melly needed her strength Melly was hurting so badthere were hot pinchers at her and dull knives and recurrent waves of pain She must hold Mellys hand But Dr Meade was there after all he had come even if the soldiers at the depot did need him for she heard him say Delirious Wheres Captain Butler The night was dark and then light and sometimes she was having a baby and sometimes it was Melanie who cried out but through it all Melly was there and her hands were cool and she did not make futile anxious gestures or sob like Aunt Pitty Whenever Scarlett opened her eyes she said Melly and the voice answered And usually she started to whisper RhettI want Rhett and remembered as from a dream that Rhett didnt want her that Rhetts face was dark as an Indians and his teeth were white in a jeer She wanted him and he didnt want her Once she said Melly and Mammys voice said Sme chile and put a cold rag on her forehead and she cried fretfully MellyMelanie over and over but for a long time Melanie did not come For Melanie was sitting on the edge of Rhetts bed and Rhett drunk and sobbing was sprawled on the floor crying his head in her lap Every time she had come out of Scarletts room she had seen him sitting on his bed his door wide watching the door across the hall The room was untidy littered with cigar butts and dishes of untouched food The bed was tumbled and unmade and he sat on it unshaven and suddenly gaunt endlessly smoking He never asked questions when he saw her She always stood in the doorway for a minute giving the news Im sorry shes worse or No she hasnt asked for you yet You see shes delirious or You mustnt give up hope Captain Butler Let me fix you some hot coffee and something to eat Youll make yourself ill Her heart always ached with pity for him although she was almost too tired and sleepy to feel anything How could people say such mean things about himsay he was heartless and wicked and unfaithful to Scarlett when she could see him getting thin before her eyes see the torment in his face Tired as she was she always tried to be kinder than usual when she gave bulletins from the sick room He looked so like a damned soul waiting judgmentso like a child in a suddenly hostile world But everyone was like a child to Melanie But when at last she went joyfully to his door to tell him that Scarlett was better she was unprepared for what she found There was a halfempty bottle of whisky on the table by the bed and the room reeked with the odor He looked at her with bright glazed eyes and his jaw muscles trembled despite his efforts to set his teeth Shes dead Oh no Shes much better He said Oh my God and put his head in his hands She saw his wide shoulders shake as with a nervous chill and as she  Page    Gone With The Wind watched him pityingly her pity changed to honor for she saw that he was crying Melanie had never seen a man cry and of all men Rhett so suave so mocking so eternally sure of himself It frightened her the desperate choking sound he made She had a terrified thought that he was drunk and Melanie was afraid of drunkenness But when he raised his head and she caught one glimpse of his eyes she stepped swiftly into the room closed the door softly behind her and went to him She had never seen a man cry but she had comforted the tears of many children When she put a soft hand on his shoulder his arms went suddenly around her skirts Before she knew how it happened she was sitting on the bed and he was on the floor his head in her lap and his arms and hands clutching her in a frantic clasp that hurt her She stroked the black head gently and said There There soothingly There Shes going to get well At her words his grip tightened and he began speaking rapidly hoarsely babbling as though to a grave which would never give up its secrets babbling the truth for the first time in his life baring himself mercilessly to Melanie who was at first utterly uncomprehending utterly maternal He talked brokenly burrowing his head in her lap tugging at the folds of her skirt Sometimes his words were blurred muffled sometimes they came far too clearly to her ears harsh bitter words of confession and abasement speaking of things she had never heard even a woman mention secret things that brought the hot blood of modesty to her cheeks and made her grateful for his bowed head She patted his head as she did little Beaus and said Hush Captain Butler You must not tell me these things You are not yourself Hush But his voice went on in a wild torrent of outpouring and he held to her dress as though it were his hope of life He accused himself of deeds she did not understand he mumbled the name of Belle Watling and then he shook her with his violence as he cried Ive killed Scarlett Ive killed her You dont understand She didnt want this baby and You must hush You are beside yourself Not want a baby Why every woman wants No No You want babies But she doesnt Not my babies You must stop You dont understand She didnt want a baby and I made her Thisthis babyits all my damned fault We hadnt been sleeping together Hush Captain Butler It is not fit And I was drunk and insane and I wanted to hurt herbecause she had hurt me I wanted toand I did but she didnt want me Shes never wanted me She never has and I triedI tried so hard and Oh please And I didnt know about this baby till the other day when she fell She didnt know where I was to write to me and tell mebut she wouldnt have written me if she had known I tell youI tell you Id have come straight homeif Id only knownwhether she wanted me home or not  Oh yes I know you would God Ive been crazy these weeks crazy and drunk And when she told me there on the stepswhat did I do What did I say I laughed and said Cheer up Maybe youll have a miscarriage And she Melanie suddenly went white and her eyes widened with horror as she looked down at the black tormented head writhing in her lap The afternoon sun streamed in through the open window and suddenly she saw as for the first time how large and brown and strong his hands were and how thickly the black hairs grew along the backs of them Involuntarily she recoiled from them They seemed so predatory so ruthless and yet twined in her skirt so broken so helpless Could it be possible that he had heard and believed the preposterous lie about Scarlett and Ashley and become jealous True he had left town immediately after the scandal broke but No it couldnt be that Captain Butler was always going off abruptly on journeys He couldnt have believed the gossip He was too sensible If that had been the cause of the trouble wouldnt he have tried to shoot Ashley Or at least demanded an explanation No it couldnt be that It was only that he was drunk and sick from strain and his mind was running wild like a man delirious babbling wild fantasies Men couldnt stand strains as well as women Something had upset him perhaps he had had a small quarrel with Scarlett and magnified it Perhaps some of the awful things he said were true But all of them could not be true Oh not that last certainly No man could say such a thing to a woman he loved as passionately as this man loved Scarlett Melanie had never seen evil never seen cruelty and now that she looked on them for the first time she found them too inconceivable to believe He was drunk and sick And sick children must be humored There There she said crooningly Hush now I understand He raised his head violently and looked up at her with bloodshot eyes fiercely throwing off her hands No by God you dont understand You cant understand Youreyoure too good to understand You dont believe me but its all true and Im a dog Do you know why I did it I was mad crazy with jealousy She never cared for me and I thought I could make her care But she never cared She doesnt love me She never has She loves His passionate drunken gaze met hers and he stopped mouth open as though for the first time he realized to whom he was speaking Her face was white and strained but her eyes were steady and sweet and full of pity and unbelief There was a luminous serenity in them and the innocence in the soft brown depths struck him like a blow in the face clearing some of the alcohol out of his brain halting his mad careering words in midflight He trailed off into a mumble his eyes dropping away from hers his lids batting rapidly as he fought back to sanity Im a cad he muttered dropping his head tiredly back into her lap But not that big a cad And if I did tell you you wouldnt believe me would you Youre too good to believe me I never before knew anybody who was really good You wouldnt believe me would you No I wouldnt believe you said Melanie soothingly beginning to stroke his hair again Shes going to get well There Captain Butler Dont cry Shes going to get well  Page    Gone With The Wind CHAPTER LVII IT WAS A PALE thin woman that Rhett put on the Jonesboro train a month later Wade and Ella who were to make the trip with her were silent and uneasy at their mothers still white face They clung close to Prissy for even to their childish minds there was something frightening in the cold impersonal atmosphere between their mother and their stepfather Weak as she was Scarlett was going home to Tara She felt that she would stifle if she stayed in Atlanta another day with her tired mind forcing itself round and round the deeply worn circle of futile thoughts about the mess she was in She was sick in body and weary in mind and she was standing like a lost child in a nightmare country in which there was no familiar landmark to guide her As she had once fled Atlanta before an invading army so she was fleeing it again pressing her worries into the back of her mind with her old defense against the world I wont think of it now I cant stand it if I do Ill think of it tomorrow at Tara Tomorrows another day It seemed that if she could only get back to the stillness and the green cotton fields of home all her troubles would fall away and she would somehow be able to mold her shattered thoughts into something she could live by Rhett watched the train until it was out of sight and on his face there was a look of speculative bitterness that was not pleasant He sighed dismissed the carriage and mounting his horse rode down Ivy Street toward Melanies house It was a warm morning and Melanie sat on the vineshaded porch her mending basket piled high with socks Confusion and dismay filled her when she saw Rhett alight from his horse and toss the reins over the arm of the castiron negro boy who stood at the sidewalk She had not seen him alone since that too dreadful day when Scarlett had been so ill and he had been sowellso drunk Melanie hated even to think the word She had spoken to him only casually during Scarletts convalescence and on those occasions she had found it difficult to meet his eyes However he had been his usual bland self at those times and never by look or word showed that such a scene had taken place between them Ashley had told her once that men frequently did not remember things said and done in drink and Melanie prayed heartily that Captain Butlers memory had failed him on that occasion She felt she would rather die than learn that he remembered his outpourings Timidity and embarrassment swept over her and waves of color mounted her cheeks as he came up the walk But perhaps he had only come to ask if Beau could spend the day with Bonnie Surely he wouldnt have the bad taste to come and thank her for what she had done that day She rose to meet him noting with surprise as always how lightly he walked for a big man Scarlett has gone Yes Tara will do her good he said smiling Sometimes I think shes like the giant Antaeus who became stronger each time he touched Mother Earth It doesnt do for Scarlett to stay away too long from the patch of red mud she loves The sight of cotton growing will do her more good than all Dr Meades tonics Wont you sit down said Melanie her hands fluttering He was so very large and male and excessively male creatures always discomposed her They seem to radiate a force and vitality that made her feel smaller and weaker even than she was He looked so swarthy and formidable and the heavy muscles in his shoulders swelled against his white linen coat in a way that frightened her It seemed impossible that she had seen all this strength and insolence brought low And she had held that black head in her lap Oh dear she thought in distress and blushed again Miss Melly he said gently does my presence annoy you Would you rather I went away Pray be frank Oh she thought He does remember And he knows how upset I am She looked up at him imploringly and suddenly her embarrassment and confusion faded His eyes were so quiet so kind so understanding that she wondered how she could ever have been silly enough to be flurried His face looked tired and she thought with surprise more than a little sad How could she have even thought hed be ill bred enough to bring up subjects both would rather forget Poor thing hes been so worried about Scarlett she thought and managing a smile she said Do sit down Captain Butler He sat down heavily and watched her as she picked up her darning Miss Melly Ive come to ask a very great favor of you and he smiled and his mouth twisted down to enlist your aid in a deception from which I know you will shrink Adeception Yes Really Ive come to talk business to you Oh dear Then its Mr Wilkes youd better see Im such a goose about business Im not smart like Scarlett Im afraid Scarlett is too smart for her own good he said and that is exactly what I want to talk to you about You know howill shes been When she gets back from Tara she will start again hammer and tongs with the store and those mills which I wish devoutly would explode some night I fear for her health Miss Melly Yes she does far too much You must make her stop and take care of herself He laughed You know how headstrong she is I never even try to argue with her Shes just like a willful child She wont let me help hershe wont let anyone help her Ive tried to get her to sell her share in the mills but she wont And now Miss Melly I come to the business matter I know Scarlett would sell the remainder of her interest in the mills to Mr Wilkes but to no one else and I want Mr Wilkes to buy her out Oh dear me That would be nice but Melanie stopped and bit her lip She could not mention money matters to an outsider Somehow despite what he made from the mill she and Ashley never seemed to have enough money It worried her that they saved so little She did not know where the money went Ashley gave her enough to run the house on but when it came to extra expenses they were often pinched Of course her doctors bills were so much and then the books and furniture Ashley ordered from New York did run into money And they had fed and clothed any number of waifs who slept in their cellar And Ashley never felt like refusing a loan to any man whod been in the Confederate Army And Miss Melly I want to lend you the money said Rhett  Page    Gone With The Wind Thats so kind of you but we might never repay it I dont want it repaid Dont be angry with me Miss Melly Please hear me through It will repay me enough to know that Scarlett will not be exhausting herself driving miles to the mills every day The store will be enough to keep her busy and happy  Dont you see Wellyes said Melanie uncertainly You want your boy to have a pony dont you And want him to go to the university and to Harvard and to Europe on a Grand Tour Oh of course cried Melanie her face lighting up as always at the mention of Beau I want him to have everything butwell everyone is so poor these days that Mr Wilkes could make a pile of money out of the mills some day said Rhett And Id like to see Beau have all the advantages he deserves Oh Captain Butler what a crafty wretch you are she cried smiling Appealing to a mothers pride I can read you like a book I hope not said Rhett and for the first time there was a gleam in his eye Now will you let me lend you the money But where does the deception come in We must be conspirators and deceive both Scarlett and Mr Wilkes Oh dear I couldnt If Scarlett knew I had plotted behind her back even for her own goodwell you know her temper And Im afraid Mr Wilkes would refuse any loan I offered him So neither of them must know where the money comes from Oh but Im sure Mr Wilkes wouldnt refuse if he understood the matter He is so fond of Scarlett Yes Im sure he is said Rhett smoothly But just the same he would refuse You know how proud all the Wilkes are Oh dear cried Melanie miserably I wish Really Captain Butler I couldnt deceive my husband  Not even to help Scarlett Rhett looked very hurt And she is so fond of you Tears trembled on Melanies eyelids You know Id do anything in the world for her I can never never half repay her for what shes done for me You know Yes he said shortly I know what shes done for you Couldnt you tell Mr Wilkes that the money was left you in the will of some relative Oh Captain Butler I havent a relative with a penny to bless him Then if I sent the money through the mail to Mr Wilkes without his knowing who sent it would you see that it was used to buy the mills and notwell given away to destitute exConfederates At first she looked hurt at his last words as though they implied criticism of Ashley but he smiled so understandingly she smiled back Of course I will So its settled Its to be our secret But I have never kept anything secret from my husband Im sure of that Miss Melly As she looked at him she thought how right she had always been about him and how wrong so many other people were People had said he was brutal and sneering and bad mannered and even dishonest Though many of the nicest people were now admitting they had been wrong Well She had known from the very beginning that he was a fine man She had never received from him anything but the kindest treatment thoughtfulness utter respect and what understanding And then how he loved Scarlett How sweet of him to take this roundabout way of sparing Scarlett one of the loads she carried In an impulsive rush of feeling she said Scarletts lucky to have a husband whos so nice to her You think so Im afraid she wouldnt agree with you if she could hear you Besides I want to be nice to you too Miss Melly Im giving you more than Im giving Scarlett Me she questioned puzzled Oh you mean for Beau He picked up his hat and rose He stood for a moment looking down at the plain heartshaped face with its long widows peak and serious dark eyes Such an unworldly face a face with no defenses against life No not Beau Im trying to give you something more than Beau if you can imagine that No I cant she said bewildered again Theres nothing in the world more precious to me than Beau except Ashexcept Mr Wilkes Rhett said nothing and looked down at her his dark face still Youre mighty nice to want to do things for me Captain Butler but really Im so lucky I have everything in the world any woman could want Thats fine said Rhett suddenly grim And I intend to see that you keep them When Scarlett came back from Tara the unhealthy pallor had gone from her face and her cheeks were rounded and faintly pink Her green eyes were alert and sparkling again and she laughed aloud for the first time in weeks when Rhett and Bonnie met her and Wade and Ella at the depotlaughed in annoyance and amusement Rhett had two straggling turkey feathers in the brim of his hat and Bonnie dressed in a sadly torn dress that was her Sunday frock had diagonal lines of indigo blue on her cheeks and a peacock feather half as long as she was in her curls Evidently a game of Indian had been in progress when the time came to meet the train and it was obvious from the look of quizzical helplessness on Rhetts face and the lowering indignation of Mammy that Bonnie had refused to have her toilet remedied even to meet her mother Scarlett said What a ragamuffin as she kissed the child and turned a cheek for Rhetts lips There were crowds of people in the depot or she would never have invited this caress She could not help noticing for all her embarrassment at Bonnies appearance that everyone in the crowd was smiling at the figure father and daughter cut smiling not in derision but in genuine  Page    Gone With The Wind amusement and kindness Everyone knew that Scarletts youngest had her father under her thumb and Atlanta was amused and approving Rhetts great love for his child had gone far toward reinstating him in public opinion On the way home Scarlett was full of County news The hot dry weather was making the cotton grow so fast you could almost hear it but Will said cotton prices were going to be low this fall Suellen was going to have another babyshe spelled this out so the children would not comprehendand Ella had shown unwonted spirit in biting Suellens oldest girl Though observed Scarlett it was no more than little Susie deserved she being her mother all over again But Suellen had become infuriated and they had had an invigorating quarrel that was just like old times Wade had killed a water moccasin all by himself Randa and Camilla Tarleton were teaching school and wasnt that a joke Not a one of the Tarletons had ever been able to spell cat Betsy Tarleton had married a fat onearmed man from Lovejoy and they and Hetty and Jim Tarleton were raising a good cotton crop at Fairhill Mrs Tarleton had a brood mare and a colt and was as happy as though she had a million dollars And there were negroes living in the old Calvert house Swarms of them and they actually owned it Theyd bought it in at the sheriffs sale The place was dilapidated and it made you cry to look at it No one knew where Cathleen and her nogood husband had gone And Alex was to marry Sally his brothers widow Imagine that after them living in the same house for so many years Everybody said it was a marriage of convenience because people were beginning to gossip about them living there alone since both Old Miss and Young Miss had died And it had about broken Dimity Munroes heart But it served her right If shed had any gumption shed have caught her another man long ago instead of waiting for Alex to get money enough to marry her Scarlett chattered on cheerfully but there were many things about the County which she suppressed things that hurt to think about She had driven over the County with Will trying not to remember when these thousands of fertile acres had stood green with cotton Now plantation after plantation was going back to the forest and dismal fields of broomsedge scrub oak and runty pines had grown stealthily about silent ruins and over old cotton fields Only one acre was being farmed now where once a hundred had been under the plow It was like moving through a dead land This section wont come back for fifty yearsif it ever comes back Will had said Taras the best farm in the County thanks to you and me Scarlett but its a farm a twomule farm not a plantation And the Fontaine place it comes next to Tare and then the Tarletons They aint makin much money but theyre getting along and they got gumption But most of the rest of the folks the rest of the farms No Scarlett did not like to remember the way the deserted County looked It seemed even sadder in retrospect beside the bustle and prosperity of Atlanta Has anything happened here she asked when they were finally home and were seated on the front porch She had talked rapidly and continuously all the way home fearing that a silence would fall She had not had a word alone with Rhett since that day when she fell down the steps and she was none too anxious to be alone with him now She did not know how he felt toward her He had been kindness itself during her miserable convalescence but it was the kindness of an impersonal stranger He had anticipated her wants kept the children from bothering her and supervised the store and the mills But he had never said Im sorry Well perhaps he wasnt sorry Perhaps he still thought that child that was never born was not his child How could she tell what went on in the mind behind the bland dark face But he had showed a disposition to be courteous for the first time in their married life and a desire to let life go on as though there had never been anything unpleasant between themas though thought Scarlett cheerlessly as though there had never been anything at all between them Well if that was what he wanted she could act her part too Is everything all right she repeated Did you get the new shingles for the store Did you swap the mules For Heavens sake Rhett take those feathers out of your hat You look a fool and youll be likely to wear them downtown without remembering to take them out No said Bonnie picking up her fathers hat defensively Everything has gone very well here replied Rhett Bonnie and I have had a nice time and I dont believe her hair has been combed since you left Dont suck the feathers darling they may be nasty Yes the shingles are fixed and I got a good trade on the mules No theres really no news Everything has been quite dull Then as an afterthought he added The honorable Ashley was over here last night He wanted to know if I thought you would sell him your mill and the part interest you have in his Scarlett who had been rocking and fanning herself with a turkey tail fan stopped abruptly Sell Where on earth did Ashley get the money You know they never have a cent Melanie spends it as fast as he makes it Rhett shrugged I always thought her a frugal little person but then Im not as well informed about the intimate details of the Wilkes family as you seem to be That jab seemed in something of Rhetts old style and Scarlett grew annoyed Run away dear she said to Bonnie Mother wants to talk to Father No said Bonnie positively and climbed upon Rhetts lap Scarlett frowned at her child and Bonnie scowled back in so complete a resemblance to Gerald OHara that Scarlett almost laughed Let her stay said Rhett comfortably As to where he got the money it seems it was sent him by someone he nursed through a case of smallpox at Rock Island It renews my faith in human nature to know that gratitude still exists Who was it Anyone we know The letter was unsigned and came from Washington Ashley was at a loss to know who could have sent it But then one of Ashleys unselfish temperament goes about the world doing so many good deeds that you cant expect him to remember all of them Had she not been so surprised at Ashleys windfall Scarlett would have taken up this gauntlet although while at Tara she had decided that never again would she permit herself to be involved in any quarrel with Rhett about Ashley The ground on which she stood in this matter was entirely too uncertain and until she knew exactly where she stood with both men she did not care to be drawn out  Page    Gone With The Wind He wants to buy me out Yes But Of course I told him you wouldnt sell I wish youd let me mind my own business Well you know you wouldnt part with the mills I told him that he knew as well as I did that you couldnt bear not to have your finger in everybodys pie and if you sold out to him then you wouldnt be able to tell him how to mind his own business You dared say that to him about me Why not Its true isnt it I believe he heartily agreed with me but of course he was too much of a gentleman to come right out and say so Its a lie I will sell them to him cried Scarlett angrily Until that moment she had had no idea of parting with the mills She had several reasons for wanting to keep them and their monetary value was the least reason She could have sold them for large sums any time in the last few years but she had refused all offers The mills were the tangible evidence of what she had done unaided and against great odds and she was proud of them and of herself Most of all she did not want to sell them because they were the only path that lay open to Ashley If the mills went from her control it would mean that she would seldom see Ashley and probably never see him alone And she had to see him alone She could not go on this way any longer wondering what his feelings toward her were now wondering if all his love had died in shame since the dreadful night of Melanies party In the course of business she could find many opportune times for conversations without it appearing to anyone that she was seeking him out And given time she knew she could gain back whatever ground she had lost in his heart But if she sold the mills No she did not want to sell but goaded by the thought that Rhett had exposed her to Ashley in so truthful and so unflattering a light she had made up her mind instantly Ashley should have the mills and at a price so low he could not help realizing how generous she was I will sell she cried furiously Now what do you think of that There was the faintest gleam of triumph in Rhetts eyes as he bent to tie Bonnies shoe string I think youll regret it he said Already she was regretting the hasty words Had they been spoken to anyone save Rhett she would have shamelessly retracted them Why had she burst out like that She looked at Rhett with an angry frown and saw that he was watching her with his old keen catatamousehole look When he saw her frown he laughed suddenly his white teeth flashing Scarlett had an uncertain feeling that he had jockeyed her into this position Did you have anything to do with this she snapped I His brows went up in mock surprise You should know me better I never go about the world doing good deeds if I can avoid it That night she sold the mills and all her interest in them to Ashley She did not lose thereby for Ashley refused to take advantage of her first low offer and met the highest bid that she had ever had for them When she had signed the papers and the mills were irrevocably gone and Melanie was passing small glasses of wine to Ashley and Rhett to celebrate the transaction Scarlett felt bereft as though she had sold one of her children The mills had been her darlings her pride the fruit of her small grasping hands She had started with one little mill in those black days when Atlanta was barely struggling up from ruin and ashes and want was staring her in the face She had fought and schemed and nursed them through the dark times when Yankee confiscation loomed when money was tight and smart men going to the wall And now when Atlanta was covering its scars and buildings were going up everywhere and newcomers flocking to the town every day she had two fine mills two lumber yards a dozen mule teams and convict labor to operate the business at low cost Bidding farewell to them was like closing a door forever on a part of her life a bitter harsh part but one which she recalled with a nostalgic satisfaction She had built up this business and now she had sold it and she was oppressed with the certainty that without her at the helm Ashley would lose it alleverything that she had worked to build Ashley trusted everyone and still hardly knew a twobyfour from a sixbyeight And now she would never be able to give him the benefit of her adviceall because Rhett had told him that she liked to boss everything Oh damn Rhett she thought and as she watched him the conviction grew that he was at the bottom of all this Just how and why she did not know He was talking to Ashley and his words brought her up sharply I suppose youll turn the convicts back right away he said Turn the convicts back Why should there be any idea of turning them back Rhett knew perfectly well that the large profits from the mills grew out of the cheap convict labor And why did Rhett speak with such certainty about what Ashleys future actions would be What did he know of him Yes theyll go back immediately replied Ashley and he avoided Scarletts dumbfounded gaze Have you lost your mind she cried Youll lose all the money on the lease and what kind of labor can you get anyway Ill use free darkies said Ashley Free darkies Fiddledeedee You know what their wages will cost and besides youll have the Yankees on your neck every minute to see if youre giving them chicken three times a day and tucking them to sleep under eiderdown quilts And if you give a lazy darky a couple of licks to speed him up youll hear the Yankees scream from here to Dalton and youll end up in jail Why convicts are the only Melanie looked down into her lap at her twisted hands Ashley looked unhappy but obdurate For a moment he was silent Then his gaze crossed Rhetts and it was as if he found understanding and encouragement in Rhetts eyesa glance that was not lost on Scarlett I wont work convicts Scarlett he said quietly Well sir her breath was taken away And why not Are you afraid people will talk about you like they do about me  Page    Gone With The Wind Ashley raised his head Im not afraid of what people say as long as Im right And I have never felt that convict labor was right But why I cant make money from the enforced labor and misery of others But you owned slaves They werent miserable And besides Id have freed them all when Father died if the war hadnt already freed them But this is different Scarlett The system is open to too many abuses Perhaps you dont know it but I do I know very well that Johnnie Gallegher has killed at least one man at his camp Maybe morewho cares about one convict more or less He said the man was killed trying to escape but thats not what Ive heard elsewhere And I know he works men who are too sick to work Call it superstition but I do not believe that happiness can come from money made from the sufferings of others Gods nightgown You meangoodness Ashley you didnt swallow all the Reverend Wallaces bellowings about tainted money I didnt have to swallow it I believed it long before he preached on it Then you must think all my money is tainted cried Scarlett beginning to be angry Because I worked convicts and own saloon property and She stopped short Both the Wilkes looked embarrassed and Rhett was grinning broadly Damn him thought Scarlett vehemently Hes thinking that Im sticking my finger in other peoples pies again and so is Ashley Id like to crack their heads together She swallowed her wrath and tried to assume an aloof air of dignity but with little success Of course its immaterial to me she said Scarlett dont think Im criticizing you Im not Its just that we look at things in different ways and what is good for you might not be good for me She suddenly wished that they were alone wished ardently that Rhett and Melanie were at the end of the earth so she could cry out But I want to look at things the way you look at them Tell me just what you mean so I can understand and be like you But with Melanie present trembling with the distress of the scene and Rhett lounging grinning at her she could only say with as much coolness and offended virtue as she could muster Im sure its your own business Ashley and far be it from me to tell you how to run it But I must say I do not understand your attitude or your remarks Oh if they were only alone so she would not be forced to say these cool things to him these words that were making him unhappy Ive offended you Scarlett and I did not mean to You must believe me and forgive me There is nothing enigmatic in what I said It is only that I believe that money which comes in certain ways seldom brings happiness But youre wrong she cried unable to restrain herself any longer Look at me You know how my money came You know how things were before I made my money You remember that winter at Tara when it was so cold and we were cutting up the carpets for shoes and there wasnt enough to eat and we used to wonder how we were going to give Beau and Wade an education You remem I remember said Ashley tiredly but Id rather forget Well you cant say any of us were happy then can you And look at us now Youve a nice home and a good future And has anyone a prettier house than mine or nicer clothes or finer horses Nobody sets as fine a table as me or gives nicer receptions and my children have everything they want Well how did I get the money to make it possible Off trees No sir Convicts and saloon rentals and And dont forget murdering that Yankee said Rhett softly He really gave you your start Scarlett swung on him furious words on her lips And the money has made you very very happy hasnt it darling he asked poisonously sweet Scarlett stopped short her mouth open and her eyes went swiftly to the eyes of the other three Melanie was almost crying with embarrassment Ashley was suddenly bleak and withdrawn and Rhett was watching her over his cigar with impersonal amusement She started to cry out But of course its made me happy But somehow she could not speak CHAPTER LVIII IN THE TIME that followed her illness Scarlett noticed a change in Rhett and she was not altogether certain that she liked it He was sober and quiet and preoccupied He was at home more often for supper now and he was kinder to the servants and more affectionate to Wade and Ella He never referred to anything in their past pleasant or otherwise and silently seemed to dare her to bring up such subjects Scarlett held her peace for it was easier to let well enough alone and life went on smoothly enough on the surface His impersonal courtesy toward her that had begun during her convalescence continued and he did not fling softly drawled barbs at her or sting her with sarcasm She realized now that though he had infuriated her with his malicious comments and roused her to heated rejoinders he had done it because he cared what she did and said Now she wondered if he cared about anything she did He was polite and disinterested and she missed his interest perverse though it had been missed the old days of bickering and retort He was pleasant to her now almost as though she were a stranger but as his eyes had once followed her they now followed Bonnie It was as though the swift flood of his life had been diverted into one narrow channel Sometimes Scarlett thought that if Rhett had given her onehalf the attention and tenderness he lavished on Bonnie life would have been different Sometimes it was hard to smile when people said How Captain Butler idolizes that child But if she did not smile people would think it strange and Scarlett hated to acknowledge even to herself that she was jealous of a little girl especially when that little girl was her favorite child Scarlett always wanted to be first in the hearts of those around her and it was obvious now that Rhett and Bonnie would always be first with each other Rhett was out late many nights but he came home sober on these nights Often she heard him whistling softly to himself as he  Page    Gone With The Wind went down the hall past her closed door Sometimes men came home with him in the late hours and sat talking in the dining room around the brandy decanter They were not the same men with whom he had drunk the first year they were married No rich Carpetbaggers no Scalawags no Republicans came to the house now at his invitation Scarlett creeping on tiptoe to the banister of the upstairs hall listened and to her amazement frequently heard the voices of Ren Picard Hugh Rising the Simmons boys and Andy Bonnell And always Grandpa Merriwether and Uncle Henry were there Once to her astonishment she heard the tones of Dr Meade And these men had once thought hanging too good for Rhett This group was always linked in her mind with Franks death and the late hours Rhett kept these days reminded her still more of the times preceding the Klan foray when Frank lost his life She remembered with dread Rhetts remark that he would even join their damned Klan to be respectable though he hoped God would not lay so heavy a penance on his shoulders Suppose Rhett like Frank One night when he was out later than usual she could stand the strain no longer When she heard the rasp of his key in the lock she threw on a wrapper and going into the gas lit upper hall met him at the top of the stairs His expression absent thoughtful changed to surprise when he saw her standing there Rhett Ive got to know Ive got to know if youif its the Klanis that why you stay out so late Do you belong In the flaring gas light he looked at her incuriously and then he smiled You are way behind the times he said There is no Klan in Atlanta now Probably not in Georgia Youve been listening to the Klan outrage stories of your Scalawag and Carpetbagger friends No Klan Are you lying to try to soothe me My dear when did I ever try to soothe you No there is no Klan now We decided that it did more harm than good because it just kept the Yankees stirred up and furnished more grist for the slander mill of his Excellency Governor Bullock He knows he can stay in power just so long as he can convince the Federal government and the Yankee newspapers that Georgia is seething with rebellion and theres a Klansman hiding behind every bush To keep in power hes been desperately manufacturing Klan outrage stories where none exist telling of loyal Republicans being hung up by the thumbs and honest darkies lynched for rape But hes shooting at a nonexistent target and he knows it Thank you for your apprehensions but there hasnt been an active Klan since shortly after I stopped being a Scalawag and became an humble Democrat Most of what he said about Governor Bullock went in one ear and out the other for her mind was mainly occupied with relief that there was no Klan any longer Rhett would not be killed as Frank was killed she wouldnt lose her store or his money But one word of his conversation swam to the top of her mind He had said we linking himself naturally with those he had once called the Old Guard Rhett she asked suddenly did you have anything to do with the breaking up of the Klan He gave her a long look and his eyes began to dance My love I did Ashley Wilkes and I are mainly responsible Ashleyand you Yes platitudinously but truly politics make strange bedfellows Neither Ashley nor I cared much for each other as bedfellows but Ashley never believed in the Klan because hes against violence of any sort And I never believed in it because its damned foolishness and not the way to get what we want Its the one way to keep the Yankees on our necks till Kingdom Come And be tween Ashley and me we convinced the hot heads that watching waiting and working would get us further than nightshirts and fiery crosses You dont mean the boys actually took your advice when you When I was a speculator A Scalawag A consorter with Yankees You forget Mrs Butler that I am now a Democrat in good standing devoted to my last drop of blood to recovering our beloved state from the hands of her ravishers My advice was good advice and they took it My advice in other political matters is equally good We have a Democratic majority in the legislature now havent we And soon my love we will have some of our good Republican friends behind the bars They are a bit too rapacious these days a bit too open Youd help put them in jail Why they were your friends They let you in on that railroadbond business that you made thousands out of Rhett grinned suddenly his old mocking grin Oh I bear them no ill will But Im on the other side now and if I can assist in any way in putting them where they belong Ill do it And how that will redound to my credit I know just enough about the inside of some of these deals to be very valuable when the legislature starts digging into themand that wont be far off from the way things look now Theyre going to investigate the governor too and theyll put him in jail if they can Better tell your good friends the Gelerts and the Hundons to be ready to leave town on a minutes notice because if they can nab the governor theyll nab them too For too many years Scarlett had seen the Republicans backed up by the force of the Yankee Army in power in Georgia to believe Rhetts light words The governor was too strongly entrenched for any legislature to do anything to him much less put him in jail How you do run on she observed If he isnt put in jail at least he wont be reelected Were going to have a Democratic governor next time for a change And I suppose youll have something to do with it she questioned sarcastically My pet I will I am having something to do with it now Thats why I stay out so late at nights Im working harder than I ever worked with a shovel in the gold rush trying to help get the election organized AndI know this will hurt you Mrs Butler but I am contributing plenty of money to the organization too Do you remember telling me years ago in Franks store that it was dishonest for me to keep the Confederate gold At last Ive come to agree with you and the Confederate gold is being spent to get the Confederates back into power Youre pouring money down a rat hole What You call the Democratic party a rat hole His eyes mocked her and then were quiet expressionless It doesnt matter a damn to me who wins this election What does matter is that everyone knows Ive worked for it and that Ive spent money on it  Page    Gone With The Wind And thatll be remembered in Bonnies favor in years to come I was almost afraid from your pious talk that youd had a change of heart but I see youve got no more sincerity about the Democrats than about anything else Not a change of heart at all Merely a change of hide You might possibly sponge the spots off a leopard but hed remain a leopard just the same Bonnie awakened by the sound of voices in the hall called sleepily but imperiously Daddy and Rhett started past Scarlett Rhett wait a minute Theres something else I want to tell you You must stop taking Bonnie around with you in the afternoons to political meetings It just doesnt look well The idea of a little girl at such places And it makes you look so silly I never dreamed that you took her until Uncle Henry mentioned it as though he thought I knew and He swung round on her and his face was hard How can you read wrong in a little girl sitting on her fathers lap while he talks to friends You may think it looks silly but it isnt silly People will remember for years that Bonnie sat on my lap while I helped run the Republicans out of this state People will remember for years The hardness went out of his face and a malicious light danced in his eyes Did you know that when people ask her who she loves best she says Daddy and the Demiquats and who she hates most she says The Scallywags People thank God remember things like that Scarletts voice rose furiously And I suppose you tell her Im a Scalawag Daddy said the small voice indignant now and Rhett still laughing went down the hall to his daughter That October Governor Bullock resigned his office and fled from Georgia Misuse of public funds waste and corruption had reached such proportions during his administration that the edifice was toppling of its own weight Even his own party was split so great had public indignation become The Democrats had a majority in the legislature now and that meant just one thing Knowing that he was going to be investigated and fearing impeachment Bullock did not wait He hastily and secretly decamped arranging that his resignation would not become public until he was safely in the North When it was announced a week after his flight Atlanta was wild with excitement and joy People thronged the streets men laughing and shaking hands in congratulation ladies kissing each other and crying Everybody gave parties in celebration and the fire department was kept busy fighting the flames that spread from the bonfires of jubilant small boys Almost out of the woods Reconstructions almost over to be sure the acting governor was a Republican too but the election was coming up in December and there was no doubt in anyones mind as to what the result would be And when the election came despite the frantic efforts of the Republicans Georgia once more had a Democratic governor There was joy then excitement too but of a different sort from that which seized the town when Bullock took to his heels This was a more sober heartfelt joy a deepsouled feeling of thanksgiving and the churches were filled as ministers reverently thanked God for the deliverance of the state There was pride too mingled with the elation and joy pride that Georgia was back in the hands of her own people again in spite of all the administration in Washington could do in spite of the army the Carpetbaggers the Scalawags and the native Republicans Seven times Congress had passed crushing acts against the state to keep it a conquered province three times the army had set aside civil law The negroes had frolicked through the legislature grasping aliens had mismanaged the government private individuals had enriched themselves from public funds Georgia had been helpless tormented abused hammered down But now in spite of them all Georgia belonged to herself again and through the efforts of her own people The sudden overturn of the Republicans did not bring joy to everyone There was consternation in the ranks of the Scalawags the Carpetbaggers and the Republicans The Gelerts and Hundons evidently apprised of Bullocks departure before his resignation became public left town abruptly disappearing into that oblivion from which they had come The other Carpetbaggers and Scalawags who remained were uncertain frightened and they hovered together for comfort wondering what the legislative investigation would bring to light concerning their own private affairs They were not insolent now They were stunned bewildered afraid And the ladies who called on Scarlett said over and over But who would have thought it would turn out this way We thought the governor was too powerful We thought he was here to stay We thought Scarlett was equally bewildered by the turn of events despite Rhetts warning as to the direction it would take It was not that she was sorry Bullock had gone and the Democrats were back again Though no one would have believed it she too felt a grim happiness that the Yankee rule was at last thrown off She remembered all too vividly her struggles during those first days of Reconstruction her fears that the soldiers and the Carpetbaggers would confiscate her money and her property She remembered her helplessness and her panic at her helplessness and her hatred of the Yankees who had imposed this galling system upon the South And she had never stopped hating them But in trying to make the best of things in trying to obtain complete security she had gone with the conquerors No matter how much she disliked them she had surrounded herself with them cut herself off from her old friends and her old ways of living And now the power of the conquerors was at an end She had gambled on the continuance of the Bullock regime and she had lost As she looked about her that Christmas of  the happiest Christmas the state had known in over ten years she was disquieted She could not help seeing that Rhett once the most execrated man in Atlanta was now one of the most popular for he had humbly recanted his Republican heresies and given his time and money and labor and thought to helping Georgia fight her way back When he rode down the streets smiling tipping his hat the small blue bundle that was Bonnie perched before him on his saddle everyone smiled back spoke with enthusiasm and looked with affection on the little girl Whereas she Scarlett CHAPTER LIX THERE WAS NO DOUBT in anyones mind that Bonnie Butler was running wild and needed a firm hand but she was so general a favorite that no one had the heart to attempt the necessary firmness She had first gotten out of control the months when  Page    Gone With The Wind she traveled with her father When she had been with Rhett in New Orleans and Charleston she had been permitted to sit up as late as she pleased and had gone to sleep in his arms in theaters restaurants and at card tables Thereafter nothing short of force would make her go to bed at the same time as the obedient Ella While she had been away with him Rhett had let her wear any dress she chose and since that time she had gone into tantrums when Mammy tried to dress her in dimity frocks and pinafores instead of blue taffeta and lace collars There seemed no way to regain the ground which had been lost when the child was away from home and later when Scarlett had been ill and at Tara As Bonnie grew older Scarlett tried to discipline her tried to keep her from becoming too headstrong and spoiled but with little success Rhett always sided with the child no matter how foolish her desires or how outrageous her behavior He encouraged her to talk and treated her as an adult listening to her opinions with apparent seriousness and pretending to be guided by them As a result Bonnie interrupted her elders whenever she pleased and contradicted her father and put him in his place He only laughed and would not permit Scarlett even to slap the little girls hand by way of reprimand If she wasnt such a sweet darling thing shed be impossible thought Scarlett ruefully realizing that she had a child with a will equal to her own She adores Rhett and he could make her behave better if he wanted to But Rhett showed no inclination to make Bonnie behave Whatever she did was right and if she wanted the moon she could have it if he could reach it for her His pride in her beauty her curls her dimples her graceful little gestures was boundless He loved her pertness her high spirits and the quaint sweet manner she had of showing her love for him For all her spoiled and willful ways she was such a lovable child that he lacked the heart to try to curb her He was her god the center of her small world and that was too precious for him to risk losing by reprimands She clung to him like a shadow She woke him earlier than he cared to wake sat beside him at the table eating alternately from his plate and her own rode in front of him on his horse and permitted no one but Rhett to undress her and put her to sleep in the small bed beside his It amused and touched Scarlett to see the iron hand with which her small child ruled her father Who would have thought that Rhett of all people would take fatherhood so seriously But sometimes a dart of jealousy went through Scarlett because Bonnie at the age of four understood Rhett better than she had ever understood him and could manage him better than she had ever managed him When Bonnie was four years old Mammy began to grumble about the impropriety of a girl child riding astraddle in front of her pa wid her dress flyin up Rhett lent an attentive ear to this remark as he did to all Mammys remarks about the proper raising of little girls The result was a small brown and white Shetland pony with a long silky mane and tail and a tiny sidesaddle with silver trimmings Ostensibly the pony was for all three children and Rhett bought a saddle for Wade too But Wade infinitely preferred his St Bernard dog and Ella was afraid of all animals So the pony became Bonnies own and was named Mr Butler The only flaw in Bonnies possessive joy was that she could not still ride astride like her father but after he had explained how much more difficult it was to ride on the sidesaddle she was content and learned rapidly Rhetts pride in her good seat and her good hands was enormous Wait till shes old enough to hunt he boasted Therell be no one like her on any field Ill take her to Virginia then Thats where the real hunting is And Kentucky where they appreciate good riders When it came to making her riding habit as usual she had her choice of colors and as usual chose blue But my darling Not that blue velvet The blue velvet is for a party dress for me laughed Scarlett A nice black broadcloth is what little girls wear Seeing the small black brows coming together For Heavens sake Rhett tell her how unsuitable it would be and how dirty it will get Oh let her have the blue velvet If it gets dirty well make her another one said Rhett easily So Bonnie had her blue velvet habit with a skirt that trailed down the ponys side and a black hat with a red plume in it because Aunt Mellys stories of Jeb Stuarts plume had appealed to her imagination On days that were bright and dear the two could be seen riding down Peachtree Street Rhett reining in his big black horse to keep pace with the fat ponys gait Sometimes they went tearing down the quiet roads about the town scattering chickens and dogs and children Bonnie beating Mr Butler with her crop her tangled curls flying Rhett holding in his horse with a firm hand that she might think Mr Butler was winning the race When he had assured himself of her seat her hands her utter fearlessness Rhett decided that the time had come for her to learn to make the low jumps that were within the reach of Mr Butlers short legs To this end he built a hurdle in the back yard and paid Wash one of Uncle Peters small nephews twentyfive cents a day to teach Mr Butler to jump He began with a bar two inches from the ground and gradually worked up the height to a foot This arrangement met with the disapproval of the three parties concerned Wash Mr Butler and Bonnie Wash was afraid of horses and only the princely sum offered induced him to take the stubborn pony over the bar dozens of times a day Mr Butler who bore with equanimity having his tail pulled by his small mistress and his hooves examined constantly felt that the Creator of ponies had not intended him to put his fat body over the bar Bonnie who could not bear to see anyone else upon her pony danced with impatience while Mr Butler was learning his lessons When Rhett finally decided that the pony knew his business well enough to trust Bonnie upon him the childs excitement was boundless She made her first jump with flying colors and thereafter riding abroad with her father held no charms for her Scarlett could not help laughing at the pride and enthusiasm of father and daughter She thought however that once the novelty had passed Bonnie would turn to other things and the neighborhood would have some peace But this sport did not pall There was a bare track worn from the arbor at the far end of the yard to the hurdle and all morning long the yard resounded with excited yells Grandpa Merriwether who had made the overland trip in  said that the yells sounded just like an Apache after a successful scalping After the first week Bonnie begged for a higher bar a bar that was a foot and a half from the ground When you are six years old said Rhett Then youll be big enough for a higher jump and Ill buy you a bigger horse Mr Butlers legs arent long enough They are too I jumped Aunt Mellys rose bushes and they are normously high  Page    Gone With The Wind No you must wait said Rhett firm for once But the firmness gradually faded away before her incessant importunings and tantrums Oh all right he said with a laugh one morning and moved the narrow white cross bar higher If you fall off dont cry and blame me Mother screamed Bonnie turning her head up toward Scarletts bedroom Mother Watch me Daddy says I can Scarlett who was combing her hair came to the window and smiled down at the tiny excited figure so absurd in the soiled blue habit I really must get her another habit she thought Though Heaven only knows how Ill make her give up that dirty one Mother watch Im watching dear said Scarlett smiling As Rhett lifted the child and set her on the pony Scarlett called with a swift rush of pride at the straight back and the proud set of the head Youre mighty pretty precious So are you said Bonnie generously and hammering a heel into Mr Butlers ribs she galloped down the yard toward the arbor Mother watch me take this one she cried laying on the crop Watch me take this one Memory rang a bell far back in Scarletts mind There was something ominous about those words What was it Why couldnt she remember She looked down at her small daughter so lightly poised on the galloping pony and her brow wrinkled as a chill swept swiftly through her breast Bonnie came on with a rush her crisp black curls jerking her blue eyes blazing They are like Pas eyes thought Scarlett Irish blue eyes and shes just like him in every way And as she thought of Gerald the memory for which she had been rumbling came to her swiftly came with the heart stopping clarity of summer lightning throwing for an instant a whole countryside into unnatural brightness She could hear an Irish voice singing hear the hard rapid pounding of hooves coming up the pasture hill at Tara hear a reckless voice so like the voice of her child Ellen Watch me take this one No she cried No Oh Bonnie stop Even as she leaned from the window there was a fearful sound of splintering wood a hoarse cry from Rhett a melee of blue velvet and flying hooves on the ground Then Mr Butler scrambled to his feet and trotted off with an empty saddle On the third night after Bonnies death Mammy waddled slowly up the kitchen steps of Melanies house She was dressed in black from her huge mens shoes slashed to permit freedom for her toes to her black head rag Her blurred old eyes were bloodshot and red rimmed and misery cried out in every line of her mountainous figure Her face was puckered in the sad bewilderment of an old ape but there was determination in her jaw She spoke a few soft words to Dilcey who nodded kindly as though an unspoken armistice existed in their old feud Dilcey put down the supper dishes she was holding and went quietly through the pantry toward the dining room In a minute Melanie was in the kitchen her table napkin in her hand anxiety in her face Miss Scarlet isnt Miss Scarlett bearin up same as allus said Mammy heavily Ah din ten ter sturb yo supper Miss Melly Ah kin wait tell you thoo ter tell you whut Ah got on mah mine Supper can wait said Melanie Dilcey serve the rest of the supper Mammy come with me Mammy waddled after her down the hall past the dining room where Ashley sat at the head of the table his own little Beau beside him and Scarletts two children opposite pairing a great clatter with their soup spoons The happy voices of Wade and Ella filled the room It was like a picnic for them to spend so long a visit with Aunt Melly Aunt Melly was always so kind and she was especially so now The death of their younger sister had affected them very little Bonnie had fallen off her pony and Mother had cried a long time and Aunt Melly had taken them home with her to play in the back yard with Beau and have tea cakes whenever they wanted them Melanie led the way to the small booklined sitting room shut the door and motioned Mammy to the sofa I was going over right after supper she said Now that Captain Butlers mother has come I suppose the funeral will be tomorrow morning De funel Dats jes it said Mammy Miss Melly wes all in deep trouble an Ahs come ter you fer hep Ain nuthin but weery load honey nuthin but weery load Has Miss Scarlett collapsed questioned Melanie worriedly Ive hardly seen her since Bonnie She has been in her

black skirt and dried her eyes You got ter come hep us Miss Melly Ah done de bes Ah kin but it doan do no good Miss Scarlett Mammy straightened Miss Melly you knows Miss Scarlett wells Ah does Whut

She doan thow it up ter me dat Ah done kilt mah chile  Oh cried Melanie stricken to the heart Her own life was so pleasant so sheltered so wrapped about with people who loved her so full of kindness that what Mammy told her was almost beyond comprehension or belief Yet there crawled into her mind a memory a picture which she hastily put  Page    Gone With The Wind from her as she would put from her the thought of anothers nudity Rhett had spoken of Belle Watling the day he cried with his head on her knees But he loved Scarlett She could not have been mistaken that day And of course Scarlett loved him What had come between them How could a husband and a wife cut each other to pieces with such sharp knives Mammy took up her story heavily Affer a wile Miss Scarlett come outer de room wite

but he do Ah done hear him say time an agin you is de onlies gret lady he knows But Melanie rose to her feet confused her heart quailing at the thought of confronting Rhett The thought of arguing with a man as grief crazed as the one Mammy depicted made her go cold The thought of entering that brightly lighted room where lay the little girl she loved so much wrung her heart What could she do What could she say to Rhett that would ease his grief and bring him back to reason For a moment she stood irresolute and through the closed door came the sound of her boys treble laughter Like a cold knife in her heart came the thought of him dead Suppose her Beau were lying upstairs his little body cold and still his merry laughter hushed Oh she cried aloud in fright and in her mind she clutched him close to her heart She knew how Rhett felt If Beau were dead how could she put him away alone with the wind and the rain and the darkness Oh Poor poor Captain Butler she cried Ill go to him now right away She sped back to the dining room said a few soft words to Ashley and surprised her little boy by hugging him close to her and kissing his blond curls passionately She left the house without a hat her dinner napkin still clutched in her hand and the pace she set was hard for Mammys old legs Once in Scarletts front hall she bowed briefly to the gathering in the library to the frightened Miss Pittypat the stately old Mrs Butler Will and Suellen She went up the stairs swiftly with Mammy panting behind her For a moment she paused before Scarletts closed door but Mammy hissed Nom doan do dat Down the hall Melly went more slowly now and stopped in front of Rhetts room She stood irresolutely for a moment as though she longed to take flight Then bracing herself like a small soldier going into battle she knocked on the door and called softly Please let me in Captain Butler Its Mrs Wilkes I want to see Bonnie The door opened quickly and Mammy shrinking back into the shadows of the hall saw Rhett huge and dark against the blazing background of candles He was swaying on his feet and Mammy could smell the whisky on his breath He looked down at Melly for a moment and then taking her by the arm he pulled her into the room and shut the door Mammy edged herself stealthily to a chair beside the door and sank into it wearily her shapeless body overflowing it She sat still weeping silently and praying Now and then she lifted the hem of her dress and wiped her eyes Strain her ears as hard as she might she could hear no words from the room only a low broken humming sound After an interminable period the door cracked open and Mellys face white and strained appeared Bring me a pot of coffee quickly and some sandwiches When the devil drove Mammy could be as swift as a lithe black sixteenyearold and her curiosity to get into Rhetts room made her work faster But her hope turned to disappointment when Melly merely opened the door a crack and took the tray For a long time Mammy strained her sharp ears but she could distinguish nothing except the clatter of silver on china and the muffled soft tones of Melanies voice Then she heard the creaking of the bed as a heavy body fell upon it and soon after the sound of  Page    Gone With The Wind boots dropping to the floor After an interval Melanie appeared in the doorway but strive though she might Mammy could not see past her into the room Melanie looked tired and there were tears glistening on her lashes but her face was serene again Go tell Miss Scarlett that Captain Butler is quite willing for the funeral to take place tomorrow morning she whispered Bress Gawd ejaculated Mammy How on uth Dont talk so loud Hes going to sleep And Mammy tell Miss Scarlett too that Ill be here all night and you bring me some coffee Bring it here Ter disyere room Yes I promised Captain Butler that if he would go to sleep I would sit up by her all night Now go tell Miss Scarlett so she wont worry any more Mammy started off down the hall her weight shaking the floor her relieved heart singing Hallelujah Hallelujah She paused thoughtfully outside of Scarletts door her mind in a ferment of thankfulness and curiosity How Miss Melley done it beyon me De angels fight on her side Ah specs Ahll tell Miss Scarlett de funel termorrer but Ah specs Ah better keep hid dat Miss Melly settin up wid Lil Miss Miss Scarlett ain gwine lak dat atall CHAPTER LX SOMETHING WAS WRONG with the world a somber frightening wrongness that pervaded everything like a dark impen etrable mist stealthily closing around Scarlett This wrongness went even deeper than Bonnies death for now the first unbearable anguish was fading into resigned acceptance of her loss Yet this eerie sense of disaster to come persisted as though something black and hooded stood just at her shoulder as though the ground beneath her feet might turn to quicksand as she trod upon it She had never before known this type of fear All her life her feet had been firmly planted in common sense and the only things she had ever feared had been the things she could see injury hunger poverty loss of Ashleys love Unanalytical she was trying to analyze now and with no success She had lost her dearest child but she could stand that somehow as she had stood other crushing losses She had her health she had as much money as she could wish and she still had Ashley though she saw less and less of him these days Even the constraint which had been between them since the day of Melanies illstarred surprise party did not worry her for she knew it would pass No her fear was not of pain or hunger or loss of love Those fears had never weighed her down as this feeling of wrongness was doingthis blighting fear that was oddly like that which she knew in her old nightmare a thick swimming mist through which she ran with bursting heart a lost child seeking a haven that was hidden from her She remembered how Rhett had always been able to laugh her out of her fears She remembered the comfort of his broad brown chest and his strong arms And so she turned to him with eyes that really saw him for the first time in weeks And the change she saw shocked her This man was not going to laugh nor was he going to comfort her For some time after Bonnies death she had been too angry with him too preoccupied with her own grief to do more than speak politely in front of the servants She had been too busy remembering the swift running patter of Bonnies feet and her bubbling laugh to think that he too might be remembering and with pain even greater than her own Throughout these weeks they had met and spoken as courteously as strangers meeting in the impersonal walls of a hotel sharing the same roof the same table but never sharing the thoughts of each other Now that she was frightened and lonely she would have broken through this barrier if she could but she found that he was holding her at arms length as though he wished to have no words with her that went beneath the surface Now that her anger was fading she wanted to tell him that she held him guiltless of Bonnies death She wanted to cry in his arms and say that she too had been overly proud of the childs horsemanship overly indulgent to her wheedlings Now she would willingly have humbled herself and admitted that she had only hurled that accusation at him out of her misery hoping by hurting him to alleviate her own hurt But there never seemed an opportune moment He looked at her out of black blank eyes that made no opportunity for her to speak And apologies once postponed became harder and harder to make and finally impossible She wondered why this should be Rhett was her husband and between them there was the unbreakable bond of two people who have shared the same bed begotten and borne a loved child and seen that child too soon laid away in the dark Only in the arms of the father of that child could she find comfort in the exchange of memories and grief that might hurt at first but would help to heal But now as matters stood between them she would as soon go to the arms of a complete stranger He was seldom at home When they did sit down to supper together he was usually drunk He was not drinking as he had formerly becoming increasingly more polished and biting as the liquor took hold of him saving amusing malicious things that made her laugh in spite of herself Now he was silently morosely drunk and as the evenings progressed soddenly drunk Sometimes in the early hours of the dawn she heard him ride into the back yard and beat on the door of the servants house so that Pork might help him up the back stairs and put him to bed Put him to bed Rhett who had always drunk others under the table without turning a hair and then put them to bed He was untidy now where once he had been well groomed and it took all Porks scandalized arguing even to make him change his linen before supper Whisky was showing in his face and the hard line of his long jaw was being obscured under an unhealthy bloat and puffs rising under his bloodshot eyes His big body with its hard swelling muscles looked soft and slack and his waist line began to thicken Often he did not come home at all or even send word that he would be away overnight Of course he might be snoring drunkenly in some room above a saloon but Scarlett always believed that he was at Belle Watlings house on these occasions Once she had seen Belle in a store a coarse overblown woman now with most of her good looks gone But for all her paint and flashy domes she was buxom and almost motherly looking Instead of dropping her eyes or glaring defiantly as did other light women when confronted by ladies Belle gave her stare for stare searching her face with an intent almost pitying look that brought a flush to Scarletts cheek  Page    Gone With The Wind But she could not accuse him now could not rage at him demand fidelity or try to shame him any more than she could bring herself to apologize for accusing him of Bonnies death She was clutched by a bewildered apathy an unhappiness that she could not understand an unhappiness that went deeper than anything she had ever known She was lonely and she could never remember being so lonely before Perhaps she had never had the time to be very lonely until now She was lonely and afraid and there was no one to whom she could turn no one except Melanie For now even Mammy her mainstay had gone back to Tara Gone permanently Mammy gave no explanation for her departure Her tired old eyes looked sadly at Scarlett when she asked for the train fare home To Scarletts tears and pleading that she stay Mammy only answered Look ter me lak Miss Ellen say ter me Mammy come home Yo wuk done finish So Ahs gwine home Rhett who had listened to the talk gave Mammy the money and patted her arm Youre right Mammy Miss Ellen is right Your work here is done Go home Let me know if you ever need anything And as Scarlett broke into renewed indignant commands Hush you fool Let her go Why should anyone want to stay in this housenow There was such a savage bright glitter in his eyes when he spoke that Scarlett shrank from him frightened Dr Meade do you think he cancan have lost his mind she questioned afterwards driven to the doctor by her own sense of helplessness No said the doctor but hes drinking like a fish and will kill himself if he keeps it up He loved the child Scarlett and I guess he drinks to forget about her Now my advice to you Miss is to give him another baby just as quickly as you can Hah thought Scarlett bitterly as she left his office That was easier said than done She would gladly have another child several children if they would take that look out of Rhetts eyes and fill up the aching spaces in her own heart A boy who had Rhetts dark handsomeness and another little girl Oh for another girl pretty and gay and willful and full of laughter not like the giddybrained Ella Why oh why couldnt God have taken Ella if He had to take one of her children Ella was no comfort to her now that Bonnie was gone But Rhett did not seem to want any other children At least he never came to her bedroom though now the door was never locked and usually invitingly ajar He did not seem to care He did not seem to care for anything now except whisky and that blowzy redhaired woman He was bitter now where he had been pleasantly jeering brutal where his thrusts had once been tempered with humor After Bonnie died many of the good ladies of the neighborhood who had been won over to him by his charming manners with his daughter were anxious to show him kindness They stopped him on the street to give him their sympathy and spoke to him from over their hedges saying that they understood But now that Bonnie the reason for his good manners was gone the manners went to He cut the ladies and their wellmeant condolences off shortly rudely But oddly enough the ladies were not offended They understood or thought they understood When he rode home in the twilight almost too drunk to stay in the saddle scowling at those who spoke to him the ladies said Poor thing and redoubled their efforts to be kind and gentle They felt very sorry for him broken hearted and riding home to no better comfort than Scarlett Everybody knew how cold and heartless she was Everybody was appalled at the seeming ease with which she had recovered from Bonnies death never realizing or caring to realize the effort that lay behind that seeming recovery Rhett had the towns tenderest sympathy and he neither knew nor cared Scarlett had the towns dislike and for once she would have welcomed the sympathy of old friends Now none of her old friends came to the house except Aunt Pitty Melanie and Ashley Only the new friends came calling in their shining carriages anxious to tell her of their sympathy eager to divert her with gossip about other new friends in whom she was not at all interested All these new people strangers every one They didnt know her They would never know her They had no realization of what her life had been before she reached her present safe eminence in her mansion on Peachtree Street They didnt care to talk about what their lives had been before they attained stiff brocades and victorias with fine teams of horses They didnt know of her struggles her privations all the things that made this great house and pretty clothes and silver and receptions worth having They didnt know They didnt care these people from Godknowswhere who seemed to live always on the surface of things who had no common memories of war and hunger and fighting who had no common roots going down into the same red earth Now in her loneliness she would have liked to while away the afternoons with Maybelle or Fanny or Mrs Elsing or Mrs Whiting or even that redoubtable old warrior Mrs Merriwether Or Mrs Bonnell oror any of her old friends and neighbors For they knew They had known war and terror and fire had seen dear ones dead before their time they had hungered and been ragged had lived with the wolf at the door And they had rebuilt fortune from ruin It would be a comfort to sit with Maybelle remembering that Maybelle had buried a baby dead in the mad flight before Sherman There would be solace in Fannys presence knowing that she and Fanny both had lost husbands in the black days of martial law It would be grim fun to laugh with Mrs Elsing recalling the old ladys face as she flogged her horse through Five Points the day Atlanta fell her loot from the commissary jouncing from her carriage It would be pleasant to match stories with Mrs Merriwether now secure on the proceeds of her bakery pleasant to say Do you remember how bad things were right after the surrender Do you remember when we didnt know where our next pair of shoes was coming from And look at us now Yes it would be pleasant Now she understood why when two exConfederates met they talked of the war with so much relish with pride with nostalgia Those had been days that tried their hearts but they had come through them They were veterans She was a veteran too but she had no cronies with whom she could refight old battles Oh to be with her own kind of people again those people who had been through the same things and knew how they hurtand yet how great a part of you they were But somehow these people had slipped away She realized that it was her own fault She had never cared until nownow that Bonnie was dead and she was lonely and afraid and she saw across her shining dinner table a swarthy sodden stranger disintegrating under her eyes CHAPTER LXI  Page    Gone With The Wind SCARLETT WAS in Marietta when Rhetts urgent telegram came There was a train leaving for Atlanta in ten minutes and she caught it carrying no baggage except her reticule and leaving Wade and Ella at the hotel with Prissy Atlanta was only twenty miles away but the train crawled interminably through the wet early autumn afternoon stopping at every bypath for passengers Panic stricken at Rhetts message mad for speed Scarlett almost screamed at every halt Down the road lumbered the train through forests faintly tiredly gold past red hillsides still scarred with serpentine breastworks past old battery emplacements and weedgrown craters down the road over which Johnstons men had retreated so bitterly fighting every step of the way Each station each crossroad the conductor called was the name of a battle the site of a skirmish Once they would have stirred Scarlett to memories of terror but now she had no thought for them Rhetts message had been Mrs Wilkes ill Come home immediately Twilight had fallen when the train pulled into Atlanta and a light misting rain obscured the town The gas street lamps glowed dully blobs of yellow in the fog Rhett was waiting for her at the depot with the carriage The very sight of his face frightened her more than his telegram She had never seen it so expressionless before She isnt she cried No Shes still alive Rhett assisted her into the carriage To Mrs Wilkes house and as fast as you can go he ordered the coachman Whats the matter with her I didnt know she was ill She looked all right last week Did she have an accident Oh Rhett it isnt really as serious as you Shes dying said Rhett and his voice had no more expression than his face She wants to see you Not Melly Oh not Melly Whats happened to her Shes had a miscarriage Aamisbut Rhett she Scarlett floundered This information on top of the horror of his announcement took her breath away You did not know she was going to have a baby She could not even shake her head Ah well I suppose not I dont think she told anyone She wanted it to be a surprise But I knew You knew But surely she didnt tell you She didnt have to tell me I knew Shes been sohappy these last two months I knew it couldnt mean anything else But Rhett the doctor said it would kill her to have another baby It has killed her said Rhett And to the coachman For Gods sake cant you drive faster But Rhett she cant be dying II didnt and I She hasnt your strength Shes never had any strength Shes never had anything but heart The carriage rocked to a standstill in front of the flat little house and Rhett handed her out Trembling frightened a sudden feeling of loneliness upon her she clasped his arm Youre coming in Rhett No he said and got back into the carriage She flew up the front steps across the porch and threw open the door There in the yellow lamplight were Ashley Aunt Pitty and India Scarlett thought Whats India doing here Melanie told her never to set foot in this house again The three rose at the sight of her Aunt Pitty biting her trembling lips to still them India staring at her grief stricken and without hate Ashley looked dull as a sleepwalker and as he came to her and put his hand upon her arm he spoke like a sleepwalker She asked for you he said She asked for you Can I see her now She turned toward the closed door of Melanies room No Dr Meade is in there now Im glad youve come Scarlett I came as quickly as I could Scarlett shed her bonnet and her cloak The train She isnt really Tell me shes better isnt she Ashley Speak to me Dont look like that She isnt really She kept asking for you said Ashley and looked her in the eyes And in his eyes she saw the answer to her question For a moment her heart stood still and then a queer fear stronger than anxiety stronger than grief began to beat in her breast It cant be true she thought vehemently trying to push back the fear Doctors make mistakes I wont think its true I cant let myself think its true Ill scream if I do I must think of something else I dont believe it she cried stormily looking into the three drawn faces as though defying them to contradict her And why didnt Melanie tell me Id never have gone to Marietta if Id known Ashleys eyes awoke and were tormented She didnt tell anyone Scarlett especially not you She was afraid youd scold her if you knew She wanted to wait threetill she thought it safe and sure and then surprise you all and laugh and say how wrong the doctors had been And she was so happy You know how she was about babieshow much shes wanted a little girl And everything went so well untiland then for no reason at all The door of Melanies room opened quietly and Dr Meade came out into the hall shutting the door behind him He stood for a moment his gray beard sunk on his chest and looked at the suddenly frozen four His gaze fell last on Scarlett As he came toward her she saw that there was grief in his eyes and also dislike and contempt that flooded her frightened heart with guilt So you finally got here he said Before she could answer Ashley started toward the closed door Not you yet said the doctor She wants to speak to Scarlett Doctor said India putting a hand on his sleeve Though her voice was toneless it plead more loudly than words Let me see her for a moment Ive been here since this morning waiting but she Let me see her for a moment I want to tell hermust tell  Page    Gone With The Wind herthat I was wrong aboutsomething She did not look at Ashley or Scarlett as she spoke but Dr Meade allowed his cold glance to fall on Scarlett Ill see Miss India he said briefly But only if youll give me your word not to use up her strength telling her you were wrong She knows you were wrong and it will only worry her to hear you apologize Pitty began timidly Please Dr Meade Miss Pitty you know youd scream and faint Pitty drew up her stout little body and gave the doctor glance for glance Her eyes were dry and there was dignity in every curve Well all right honey a little later said the doctor more kindly Come Scarlett They tiptoed down the hall to the closed door and the doctor put his hand on Scarletts shoulder in a hard grip Now Miss he whispered briefly no hysterics and no deathbed confessions from you or before God I will wring your neck Dont give me any of your innocent stares You know what I mean Miss Melly is going to die easily and you arent going to ease your own conscience by telling her anything about Ashley Ive never harmed a woman yet but if you say anything nowyoull answer to me He opened the door before she could answer pushed her into the room and closed the door behind her The little room cheaply furnished in black walnut was in semidarkness the lamp shaded with a newspaper It was as small and prim a room as a schoolgirls the narrow little lowbacked bed the plain net curtains looped back the clean faded rag rugs on the floor were so different from the lavishness of Scarletts own bedroom with its towering carved furniture pink brocade draperies and rosestrewn carpet Melanie lay in the bed her figure under the counterpane shrunken and flat like a little girls Two black braids fell on either side of her face and her closed eyes were sunken in twin purple circles At the sight of her Scarlett stood transfixed leaning against the door Despite the gloom of the room she could see that Melanies face was of a waxy yellow color It was drained of lifes blood and there was a pinched look about the nose Until that moment Scarlett had hoped Dr Meade was mistaken But now she knew In the hospitals during the war she had seen too many faces wearing this pinched look not to know what it inevitably presaged Melanie was dying but for a moment Scarletts mind refused to take it in Melanie could not die It was impossible for her to die God wouldnt let her die when she Scarlett needed her so much Never before had it occurred to her that she needed Melanie But now the truth surged in down to the deepest recesses of her soul She had relied on Melanie even as she had relied upon herself and she had never known it Now Melanie was dying and Scarlett knew she could not get along without her Now as she tiptoed across the room toward the quiet figure panic clutching at her heart she knew that Melanie had been her sword and her shield her comfort and her strength I must hold her I cant let her get away she thought and sank beside the bed with a rustle of skirts Hastily she grasped the limp hand lying on the coverlet and was frightened anew by its chill Its me Melly she said Melanies eyes opened a slit and then as if having satisfied herself that it was really Scarlett she closed them again After a pause she drew a breath and whispered Promise me Oh anything Beaulook after him Scarlett could only nod a strangled feeling in her throat and she gently pressed the hand she held by way of assent I give him to you There was the faintest trace of a smile I gave him to you once beforememberbefore he was born Did she remember Could she ever forget that time Almost as clearly as if that dreadful day had returned she could feel the stifling heat of the September noon remembering her terror of the Yankees hear the tramp of the retreating troops recall Melanies voice begging her to take the baby should she dieremember too how she had hated Melanie that day and hoped that she would die Ive killed her she thought in superstitious agony I wished so often she would die and God heard me and is punishing me Oh Melly dont talk like that You know youll pull through this No Promise Scarlett gulped You know I promise Ill treat him like he was my own boy College asked Melanies fault flat voice Oh yes The university and Harvard and Europe and anything he wantsandanda ponyand music lessons Oh please Melly do try Do make an effort The silence fell again and on Melanies face there were signs of a struggle to gather strength to speak Ashley she said Ashley and you Her voice faltered into stillness At the mention of Ashleys name Scarletts heart stood still cold as granite within her Melanie had known all the time Scarlett dropped her head on the coverlet and a sob that would not rise caught her throat with a cruel hand Melanie knew Scarlett was beyond shame now beyond any feeling save a wild remorse that she had hurt this gentle creature throughout the long years Melanie had knownand yet she had remained her loyal friend Oh if she could only live those years over again She would never even let her eyes meet those of Ashley O God she prayed rapidly do please let her live Ill make it up to her Ill be so good to her Ill never even speak to Ashley again as long as I live if Youll only let her get well Ashley said Melanie feebly and her fingers readied out to touch Scarletts bowed head Her thumb and forefinger tugged with no more strength than that of a baby at Scarletts hair Scarlett knew what that meant knew Melanie wanted her to look up But she could not could not meet Melanies eyes and read that knowledge in them Ashley Melanie whispered again and Scarlett gripped herself When she looked God in the face on the Day of Judgment and  Page    Gone With The Wind read her sentence in His eyes it would not be as bad as this Her soul cringed but she raised her head She saw only the same dark loving eyes sunken and drowsy with death the same tender mouth tiredly fighting pain for breath No reproach was there no accusation and no fearonly an anxiety that she might not find strength for words For a moment Scarlett was too stunned to even feel relief Then as she held Melanies hand more closely a flood of warm gratitude to God swept over her and for the first time since her childhood she said a humble unselfish prayer Thank You God I know Im not worth it but thank You for not letting her know What about Ashley Melly Youlllook after him Oh yes He catches coldso easily There was a pause Look afterhis businessyou understand Yes I understand I will She made a great effort Ashley isntpractical Only death could have forced that disloyalty from Melanie Look after him Scarlettbutdont ever let him know Ill look after him and the business too and Ill never let him know Ill just kind of suggest things to him Melanie managed a small smile but it was a triumphant one as her eyes met Scarletts again Their glance sealed the bargain that the protection of Ashley Wilkes from a too harsh world was passing from one woman to another and that Ashleys masculine pride should never be humbled by this knowledge Now the struggle went out of the tired face as though with Scarletts promise ease had come to her Youre so smartso bravealways been so good to me At these words the sob came freely to Scarletts throat and she clapped her hand over her mouth Now she was going to bawl like a child and cry out Ive been a devil Ive wronged you so I never did anything for you It was all for Ashley She rose to her feet abruptly sinking her teeth into her thumb to regain her control Rhetts words came back to her again She loves you Let that be your cross Well the cross was heavier now It was bad enough that she had tried by every art to take Ashley from her But now it was worse that Melanie who had trusted her blindly through life was laying the same love and trust on her in death No she could not speak She could not even say again Make an effort to live She must let her go easily with out a struggle without tears without sorrow The door opened slightly and Dr Meade stood on the threshold beckoning imperiously Scarlett bent over the bed choking back her tears and taking Melanies hand laid it against her cheek Good night she said and her voice was steadier than she thought it possibly could be Promise me came the whisper very softly now Anything darling Captain Butlerbe kind to him Heloves you so Rhett thought Scarlett bewildered and the words meant nothing to her Yes indeed she said automatically and pressing a light kiss on the hand laid it back on the bed Tell the ladies to come in immediately whispered the doctor as she passed through the door Through blurred eyes she saw India and Pitty follow the doctor into the room holding their skirts close to their sides to keep them from rustling The door closed behind them and the house was still Ashley was nowhere to be seen Scarlett leaned her head against the wall like a naughty child in a corner and rubbed her aching throat Behind that door Melanie was going and with her the strength upon which she had relied unknowingly for so many years Why oh why had she not realized before this how much she loved and needed Melanie But who would have thought of small plain Melanie as a tower of strength Melanie who was shy to tears before strangers timid about raising her voice in an opinion of her own fearful of the disapproval of old ladies Melanie who lacked the courage to say Boo to a goose And yet Scarletts mind went back through the years to the still hot noon at Tara when gray smoke curled above a blueclad body and Melanie stood at the top of the stairs with Charles saber in her hand Scarlett remembered that she had thought at the time How silly Melly couldnt even heft that sword But now she knew that had the necessity arisen Melanie would have charged down those stairs and killed the Yankeeor been killed herself Yes Melanie had been there that day with a sword in her small hand ready to do battle for her And now as Scarlett looked sadly back she realized that Melanie had always been there beside her with a sword in her hand unobtrusive as her own shadow loving her fighting for her with blind passionate loyalty fighting Yankees fire hunger poverty public opinion and even her beloved blood kin Scarlett felt her courage and selfconfidence ooze from her as she realized that the sword which had flashed between her and the world was sheathed forever Melly is the only woman friend I ever had she thought forlornly the only woman except Mother who really loved me Shes like Mother too Everyone who knew her has clung to her skirts Suddenly it was as if Ellen were lying behind that closed door leaving the world for a second time Suddenly she was standing at Tara again with the world about her ears desolate with the knowledge that she could not face life without the terrible strength of the weak the gentle the tender hearted She stood in the hall irresolute frightened and the glaring light of the fire in the sitting room threw tall dim shadows on the walls about her The house was utterly still and the stillness soaked into her like a fine chill rain Ashley Where was Ashley She went toward the sitting room seeking him like a cold animal seeking the fire but he was not there She must find him She  Page    Gone With The Wind had discovered Melanies strength and her dependence on it only to lose it in the moment of discovery but there was still Ashley left There was Ashley who was strong and wise and comforting In Ashley and his love lay strength upon which to lay her weakness courage to bolster her fear ease for her sorrow He must be in his room she thought and tiptoeing down the hall she knocked softly There was no answer so she pushed the door open Ashley was standing in front of the dresser looking at a pair of Melanies mended gloves First he picked up one and looked at it as though he had never seen it before Then he laid it down gently as though it were made of glass and picked up the other one She said  Ashley in a trembling voice and he turned slowly and looked at her The drowsy aloofness had gone from his gray eyes and they were wide and unmasked In them she saw fear that matched her own fear helplessness weaker than her own bewilderment more profound than she would ever know The feeling of dread which had possessed her in the hall deepened as she saw his face She went toward him Im frightened she said Oh Ashley hold me Im so frightened He made no move to her but stared gripping the glove tightly in both hands She put a hand on his arm and whispered What is it His eyes searched her intently hunting hunting desperately for something he did not find Finally he spoke and his voice was not his own I was wanting you he said I was going to run and find yourun like a child wanting comfortand I find a child more frightened running to me Not youyou cant be frightened she cried Nothing has ever frightened you But I Youve always been so strong If Ive ever been strong it was because she was behind me he said his voice breaking and he looked down at the glove and smoothed the fingers Andandall the strength I ever had is going with her There was such a note of wild despair in his low voice that she dropped her hand from his arm and stepped back And in the heavy silence that fell between them she felt that she really understood him for the first time in her life Why she said slowly why Ashley you love her dont you He spoke as with an effort She is the only dream I ever had that lived and breathed and did not die in the face of reality Dreams she thought an old irritation stirring Always dreams with him Never common sense With a heart that was heavy and a little bitter she said Youve been such a fool Ashley Why couldnt you see that she was worth a million of me Scarlett please If you only knew what Ive gone through since the doctor What youve gone through Dont you think that I Oh Ashley you should have known years ago that you loved her and not me Why didnt you Everything would have been so different so Oh you should have realized and not kept me dangling with all your talk about honor and sacrifice If youd told me years ago Id have It would have killed me but I could have stood it somehow But you wait till now till Mellys dying to find it out and now its too late to do anything Oh Ashley men are supposed to know such thingsnot women You should have seen so clearly that you loved her all the time and only wanted me likelike Rhett wants that Watling woman He winced at her words but his eyes still met hers imploring silence comfort Every line of his face admitted the truth of her words The very droop of his shoulders showed that his own selfcastigation was more cruel than any she could give He stood silent before her clutching the glove as though it were an understanding hand and in the stillness that followed her words her indignation fell away and pity tinged with contempt took its place Her conscience smote her She was kicking a beaten and de fenseless manand she had promised Melanie that she would look after him And just as soon as I promised her I said mean hurting things to him and theres no need for me to say them or for anyone to say them He knows the truth and its killing him she thought desolately Hes not grown up Hes a child like me and hes sick with fear at losing her Melly knew how it would beMelly knew him far better than I do Thats why she said look after him and Beau in the same breath How can Ashley ever stand this I can stand it I can stand anything Ive had to stand so much But he canthe cant stand anything without her Forgive me darling she said gently putting out her arms I know what you must be suffering But remember she doesnt know anythingshe never even suspected God was that good to us He came to her quickly and his arms went round her blindly She tiptoed to bring her warm cheek comfortingly against his and with one hand she smoothed the back of his hair Dont cry sweet Shed want you to be brave Shell want to see you in a moment and you must be brave She mustnt see that youve been crying It would worry her He held her in a grip that made breathing difficult and his choking voice was in her ear What will I do I cantI cant live without her I cant either she thought shuddering away from the picture of the long years to come without Melanie But she caught herself in a strong grasp Ashley was depending on her Melanie was depending on her As once before in the moonlight at Tara drunk exhausted she had thought Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them Well her shoulders were strong and Ashleys were not She squared her shoulders for the load and with a calmness she was far from feeling kissed his wet cheek without fever or longing or passion only with cool gentleness We shall managesomehow she said A door opened with sudden violence into the hall and Dr Meade called with sharp urgency Ashley Quick My God Shes gone thought Scarlett And Ashley didnt get to tell her goodby But maybe Hurry she cried aloud giving him a push for he stood staring like one stunned Hurry She pulled open the door and motioned him through Galvanized by her words he ran into the hall the glove still clasped  Page    Gone With The Wind closely in his hand She heard his rapid steps for a moment and then the closing of a door She said My God again and walking slowly to the bed sat down upon it and dropped her head in her hands She was suddenly tired more tired than she had ever been in all her life With the sound of the closing door the strain under which she had been laboring the strain which had given her strength suddenly snapped She felt exhausted in body and drained of emotions Now she felt no sorrow or remorse no fear or amazement She was tired and her mind ticked away dully mechanically as the clock on the mantel Out of the dullness one thought arose Ashley did not love her and had never really loved her and the knowledge did not hurt It should hurt She should be desolate broken hearted ready to scream at fate She had relied upon his love for so long It had upheld her through so many dark places Yet there the truth was He did not love her and she did not care She did not care because she did not love him She did not love him and so nothing he could do or say could hurt her She lay down on the bed and put her head on the pillow tiredly Useless to try to combat the idea useless to say to herself But I do love him Ive loved him for years Love cant change to apathy in a minute But it could change and it had changed He never really existed at all except in my imagination she thought wearily I loved something I made up something thats just as dead as Melly is I made a pretty suit of clothes and fell in love with it And when Ashley came riding along so handsome so different I put that suit on him and made him wear it whether it fitted him or not And I wouldnt see what he really was I kept on loving the pretty clothesand not him at all Now she could look back down the long years and see herself in green flowered dimity standing in the sunshine at Tara thrilled by the young horseman with his blond hair shining like a silver helmet She could see so clearly now that he was only a childish fancy no more important really than her spoiled desire for the aquamarine earbobs she had coaxed out of Gerald For once she owned the earbobs they had lost their value as everything except money lost its value once it was hers And so he too would have become cheap if in those first faraway days she had ever had the satisfaction of refusing to marry him If she had ever had him at her mercy seen him grown passionate importunate jealous sulky pleading like the other boys the wild infatuation which had possessed her would have passed blowing away as lightly as mist before sunshine and light wind when she met a new man What a fool Ive been she thought bitterly And now Ive got to pay for it What Ive wished for so often has happened Ive wished Melly was dead so I could have him And now shes dead and Ive got him and I dont want him His damned honor will make him ask me if I want to divorce Rhett and marry him Marry him I wouldnt have him on a silver platter But just the same Ive got him round my neck for the rest of my life As long as I live Ill have to look after him and see that he doesnt starve and that people dont hurt his feelings Hell be just another child clinging to my skirts Ive lost my lover and Ive got another child And if I hadnt promised Melly IdI wouldnt care if I never saw him again CHAPTER LXII SHE HEARD whispering voices outside and going to the door she saw the frightened negroes standing in the back hall Dilcey with her arms sagging under the heavy weight of the sleeping Beau Uncle Peter crying and Cookie wiping her wide wet face on her apron All three looked at her dumbly asking what they were to do now She looked up the hall toward the sitting room and saw India and Aunt Pitty standing speechless holding each others hands and for once India had lost her stiffnecked look Like the negroes they looked imploringly at her expecting her to give instructions She walked into the sitting room and the two women closed about her Oh Scarlett what began Aunt Pitty her fat childs mouth shaking Dont speak to me or Ill scream said Scarlett Overwrought nerves brought sharpness to her voice and her hands clenched at her sides The thought of speaking of Melanie now of making the inevitable arrangements that follow a death made her throat tighten I dont want a word out of either of you At the authoritative note in her voice they fell back helpless hurt looks on their faces I mustnt cry in front of them she thought I mustnt break now or theyll begin crying too and then the darkies will begin screaming and well all go mad I must pull myself together Theres so much Ill have to do See the undertaker and arrange the funeral and see that the house is clean and be here to talk to people wholl cry on my neck Ashley cant do them Ive got to do them Oh what a weary load Its always been a weary load and always some one elses load She looked at the dazed hurt faces of India and Pitty and contrition swept her Melanie would not like her to be so sharp with those who loved her Im sorry I was cross she said speaking with difficulty Its just that IIm sorry I was cross Auntie Im going out on the porch for a minute Ive got to be alone Then Ill come back and well She patted Aunt Pitty and went swiftly by her to the front door knowing if she stayed in this room another minute her control would crack She had to be alone And she had to cry or her heart would break She stepped onto the dark porch and closed the door behind her and the moist night air was cool upon her face The rain had ceased and there was no sound except for the occasional drip of water from the eaves The world was wrapped in a thick mist a faintly chill mist that bore on its breath the smell of the dying year All the houses across the street were dark except one and the light from a lamp in the window falling into the street struggled feebly with the fog golden particles floating in its rays It was as if the whole world were enveloped in an unmoving blanket of gray smoke And the whole world was still She leaned her head against one of the uprights of the porch and prepared to cry but no tears came This was a calamity too deep for tears Her body shook There still reverberated in her mind the crashes of the two impregnable citadels of her life thundering to dust about her ears She stood for a while trying to summon up her old charm Ill think of all this tomorrow when I can stand it better But the charm had lost its potency She had to think of two things nowMelanie and how much she loved and needed her Ashley and the obstinate blindness that had made her refuse to see him as he really was And she knew that  Page    Gone With The Wind thoughts of them would hurt just as much tomorrow and all the tomorrows of her life I cant go back in there and talk to them now she thought I cant face Ashley tonight and comfort him Not tonight Tomorrow morning Ill come early and do the things I must do say the comforting things I must say But not tonight I cant Im going home Home was only five blocks away She would not wait for the sobbing Peter to harness the buggy would not wait for Dr Meade to drive her home She could not endure the tears of the one the silent condemnation of the other She went swiftly down the dark front steps without her coat or bonnet and into the misty night She rounded the corner and started up the long hill toward Peachtree Street walking in a still wet world and even her footsteps were as noiseless as a dream As she went up the hill her chest tight with tears that would not come there crept over her an unreal feeling a feeling that she had been in this same dim chill place before under a like set of circumstancesnot once but many times before How silly she thought uneasily quickening her steps Her nerves were playing her tricks But the feeling persisted stealthily pervading her mind She peered about her uncertainly and the feeling grew eerie but familiar and her head went up sharply like an animal scenting danger Its just that Im worn out she tried to soothe herself And the nights so queer so misty I never saw such thick mist before exceptexcept And then she knew and fear squeezed her heart She knew now In a hundred nightmares she had fled through fog like this through a haunted country without landmarks thick with cold cloaking mist peopled with clutching ghosts and shadows Was she dreaming again or was this her dream come true For an instant reality went out of her and she was lost The old nightmare feeling was sweeping her stronger than ever and her heart began to race She was standing again amid death and stillness even as she had once stood at Tara All that mattered in the world had gone out of it life was in ruins and panic howled through her heart like a cold wind The horror that was in the mist and was the mist laid hands upon her And she began to run As she had run a hundred times in dreams she ran now flying blindly she knew not where driven by a nameless dread seeking in the gray mist for the safety that lay somewhere Up the dim street she fled her head down her heart hammering the night air wet on her lips the trees overhead menacing Somewhere somewhere in this wild land of moist stillness there was a refuge She sped gasping up the long hill her wet skirts wrapping coldly about her ankles her lungs bursting the tightlaced stays pressing her ribs into her heart Then before her eyes there loomed a light a row of lights dim and flickering but none the less real In her nightmare there had never been any lights only gray fog Her mind seized on those lights Lights meant safety people reality Suddenly she stopped running her hands clenching struggling to pull herself out of her panic staring intently at the row of gas lamps which had signaled to her brain that this was Peachtree Street Atlanta and not the gray world of sleep and ghosts She sank down panting on a carriage block clutching at her nerves as though they were ropes slipping swiftly through her hands I was runningrunning like a crazy person she thought her body shaking with lessening fear her thudding heart making her sick But where was I running Her breath came more easily now and she sat with her hand pressed to her side and looked up Peachtree Street There at the top of the hill was her own house It looked as though every window bore lights lights defying the mist to dim their brilliance Home It was real She looked at the dim faroff bulk of the house thankfully longingly and something like calm fell on her spirit Home That was where she wanted to go That was where she was running Home to Rhett At this realization it was as though chains fell away from her and with them the fear which had haunted her dreams since the night she stumbled to Tara to find the world ended At the end of the road to Tara she had found security gone all strength all wisdom all loving tenderness all understanding goneall those things which embodied in Ellen had been the bulwark of her girlhood And though she had won material safety since that night in her dreams she was still a frightened child searching for the lost security of that lost world Now she knew the haven she had sought in dreams the place of warm safety which had always been bidden from her in the mist It was not Ashleyoh never Ashley There was no more warmth in him than in a marsh light no more security than in quicksand It was RhettRhett who had strong arms to hold her a broad chest to pillow her tired head jeering laughter to pull her affairs into proper perspective And complete understanding because he like her saw truth as truth unobstructed by impractical notions of honor sacrifice or high belief in human nature He loved her Why hadnt she realized that he loved her for all his taunting remarks to the contrary Melanie had seen it and with her last breath had said Be kind to him Oh she thought Ashleys not the only stupidly blind person I should have seen For years she had had her back against the stone wall of Rhetts love and had taken it as much for granted as she had taken Melanies love flattering herself that she drew her strength from herself alone And even as she had realized earlier in the evening that Melanie had been beside her in her bitter campaigns against life now she knew that silent in the background Rhett had stood loving her understanding her ready to help Rhett at the bazaar reading her impatience in her eyes and leading her out in the reel Rhett helping her out of the bondage of mourning Rhett convoying her through the fire and explosions the night Atlanta fell Rhett lending her the money that gave her her start Rhett who comforted her when she woke in the nights crying with fright from her dreamswhy no man did such things without loving a woman to distraction The trees dripped dampness upon her but she did not feel it The mist swirled about her and she paid it no heed For when she thought of Rhett with his swarthy face flashing teeth and dark alert eyes a trembling came over her I love him she thought and as always she accepted the truth with little wonder as a child accepting a gift I dont know how long Ive loved him but its true And if it hadnt been for Ashley Id have realized it long ago Ive never been able to see the world at all because Ashley stood in the way She loved him scamp blackguard without scruple or honorat least honor as Ashley saw it Damn Ashleys honor she thought Ashleys honor has always let me down Yes from the very beginning when he kept on coming to see me even though he knew his family expected him to marry Melanie Rhett has never let me down even that dreadful night of Mellys reception when he ought to have wrung my neck Even when he left me on the road the night Atlanta fell he knew Id be safe He knew Id  Page    Gone With The Wind get through somehow Even when he acted like he was going to make me pay to get that money from him at the Yankee camp He wouldnt have taken me He was just testing me Hes loved me all along and Ive been so mean to him Time and again Ive hurt him and he was too proud to show it And when Bonnie died Oh how could I She stood up straight and looked at the house on the hill She had thought half an hour ago that she had lost everything in the world except money everything that made life desirable Ellen Gerald Bonnie Mammy Melanie and Ashley She had to lose them all to realize that she loved Rhettloved him because he was strong and unscrupulous passionate and earthy like herself Ill tell him everything she thought Hell understand Hes always understood Ill tell him what a fool Ive been and how much I love him and Ill make it up to him Suddenly she felt strong and happy She was not afraid of the darkness or the fog and she knew with a singing in her heart that she would never fear them again No matter what mists might curl around her in the future she knew her refuge She started briskly up the street toward home and the blocks seemed very long Far far too long She caught up her skirts to her knees and began to run lightly But this time she was not running from fear She was running because Rhetts arms were at the end of the street CHAPTER LXIII THE FRONT DOOR was slightly ajar and she trotted breathless into the hall and paused for a moment under the rainbow prisms of the chandelier For all its brightness the house was very still not with the serene stillness of sleep but with a watchful tired silence that was faintly ominous She saw at a glance that Rhett was not in the parlor or the library and her heart sank Suppose he should be outout with Belle or wherever it was he spent the many evenings when he did not appear at the supper table She had not bargained on this She had started up the steps in search of him when she saw that the door of the dining room was closed Her heart contracted a little with shame at the sight of that closed door remembering the many nights of this last summer when Rhett had sat there alone drinking until he was sodden and Pork came to urge him to bed That had been her fault but shed change it all Everything was to be different from now onbut please God dont let him be too drunk tonight If hes too drunk he wont believe me and hell laugh at me and that will break my heart She quietly opened the diningroom door a crack and peered in He was seated before the table slumped in his chair and a full decanter stood before him with the stopper in place the glass unused Thank God he was sober She pulled open the door holding herself back from running to him But when he looked up at her something in his gaze stopped her dead on the threshold stilled the words on her lips He looked at her steadily with dark eyes that were heavy with fatigue and there was no leaping light in them Though her hair was tumbling about her shoulders her bosom heaving breathlessly and her skirts mud splattered to the knees his face did not change with surprise or question or his lips twist with mockery He was sunken in his chair his suit wrinkling untidily against his thickening waist every line of him proclaiming the ruin of a fine body and the coarsening of a strong face Drink and dissipation had done their work on the coinclean profile and now it was no longer the head of a young pagan prince on newminted gold but a decadent tired Caesar on copper debased by long usage He looked up at her as she stood there hand on heart looked quietly almost in a kindly way that frightened her Come and sit down he said She is dead She nodded and advanced hesitantly toward him uncertainty taking form in her mind at this new expression on his face Without rising he pushed back a chair with his foot and she sank into it She wished he had not spoken of Melanie so soon She did not want to talk of her now to relive the agony of the last hour There was all the rest of her life in which to speak of Melanie But it seemed to her now driven by a fierce desire to cry I love you that there was only this night this hour in which to tell Rhett what was in her mind But there was something in his face that stopped her and she was suddenly ashamed to speak of love when Melanie was hardly cold Well God rest her he said heavily She was the only completely kind person I ever knew Oh Rhett she cried miserably for his words brought up too vividly all the kind things Melanie had ever done for her Why didnt you come in with me It was dreadfuland I needed you so I couldnt have borne it he said simply and for a moment he was silent Then he spoke with an effort and said softly A very great lady His somber gaze went past her and in his eyes was the same look she had seen in the light of the flames the night Atlanta fell when he told her he was going off with the retreating armythe surprise of a man who knows himself utterly yet discovers in himself unexpected loyalties and emotions and feels a faint selfridicule at the discovery His moody eyes went over her shoulder as though he saw Melanie silently passing through the room to the door In the look of farewell on his face there was no sorrow no pain only a speculative wonder at himself only a poignant stirring of emotions dead since boyhood as he said again A very great lady Scarlett shivered and the glow went from her heart the fine warmth the splendor which had sent her home on winged feet She halfgrasped what was in Rhetts mind as he said farewell to the only person in the world he respected and she was desolate again with a terrible sense of loss that was no longer personal She could not wholly understand or analyze what he was feeling but it seemed almost as if she too had been brushed by whispering skirts touching her softly in a last caress She was seeing through Rhetts eyes the passing not of a woman but of a legendthe gentle selfeffacing but steelspined women on whom the South had builded its house in war and to whose proud and loving arms it had returned in defeat His eyes came back to her and his voice changed Now it was light and cool So shes dead That makes it nice for you doesnt it Oh how can you say such things she cried stung the quick tears coming to her eyes You know how I loved her No I cant say I did Most unexpected and its to your credit considering your passion for white trash that you could  Page    Gone With The Wind appreciate her at last How can you talk so Of course I appreciated her You didnt You didnt know her like I did It isnt in you to understand herhow good she was Indeed Perhaps not She thought of everybody except herselfwhy her last words were about you There was a flash of genuine feeling in his eyes as he turned to her What did she say Oh not now Rhett Tell me His voice was cool but the hand he put on her wrist hurt She did not want to tell this was not the way she had intended to lead up to the subject of her love but his hand was urgent She saidshe said Be kind to Captain Butler He loves you so much  He stared at her and dropped her wrist His eyelids went down leaving his face dark and blank Suddenly he rose and going to the window he drew the curtains and looked out intently as if there were something to see outside except blinding mist Did she say anything else he questioned not turning his head She asked me to take care of little Beau and I said I would like he was my own boy What else She saidAshleyshe asked me to look after Ashley too He was silent for a moment and then he laughed softly Its convenient to have the first wifes permission isnt it What do you mean He turned and even in her confusion she was surprised that there was no mockery in his face Nor was there any more interest in it than in the face of a man watching the last act of a nonetooamusing comedy I think my meanings plain enough Miss Melly is dead You certainly have all the evidence you want to divorce me and you havent enough reputation left for a divorce to hurt you And you havent any religion left so the Church wont matter ThenAshley and dreams come true with the blessings of Miss Melly Divorce she cried No No Incoherent for a moment she leaped to her feet and running to him caught his arm Oh youre all wrong Terribly wrong I dont want a divorce I She stopped for she could find no other words He put his hand under her chin quietly turned her face up to the light and looked for an intent moment into her eyes She looked up at him her heart in her eyes her lips quivering as she tried to speak But she could marshal no words because she was trying to find in his face some answering emotions some leaping light of hope of joy Surely he must know now But the smooth dark blankness which had baffled her so often was all that her frantic searching eyes could find He dropped her chin and turning walked back to his chair and sprawled tiredly again his chin on his breast his eyes looking up at her from under black brows in an impersonal speculative way She followed him back to his chair her hands twisting and stood before him You are wrong she began again finding words Rhett tonight when I knew I ran every step of the way home to tell you Oh darling I You are tired he said still watching her Youd better go to bed But I must tell you Scarlett he said heavily I dont want to hearanything But you dont know what Im going to say My pet its written plainly on your face Something someone has made you realize that the unfortunate Mr Wilkes is too large a mouthful of Dead Sea fruit for even you to chew And that same something has suddenly set my charms before you in a new and attractive light he sighed slightly And its no use to talk about it She drew a sharp surprised breath Of course he had always read her easily Heretofore she had resented it but now after the first shock at her own transparency her heart rose with gladness and relief He knew he understood and her task was miraculously made easy No use to talk about it Of course he was bitter at her long neglect of course he was mistrustful of her sudden turnabout She would have to woo him with kindness convince him with a rich outpouring of love and what a pleasure it would be to do it Darling Im going to tell you everything she said putting her hands on the arm of his chair and leaning down to him Ive been so wrong such a stupid fool Scarlett dont go on with this Dont be humble before me I cant bear it Leave us some dignity some reticence to remember out of our marriage Spare us this last She straightened up abruptly Spare us this last What did he mean by this last Last This was their first their beginning But I will tell you she began rapidly as if fearing his hand upon her mouth silencing her Oh Rhett I love you so darling I must have loved you for years and I was such a fool I didnt know it Rhett you must believe me He looked at her standing before him for a moment a long look that went to the back of her mind She saw there was belief in his eyes but little interest Oh was he going to be mean at this of all times To torment her pay her back in her own coin Oh I believe you he said at last But what of Ashley Wilkes Ashley she said and made an impatient gesture II dont believe Ive cared anything about him for ages It waswen a sort of habit I hung onto from when I was a little girl Rhett Id never even thought I cared about him if Id ever known what he was really like Hes such a helpless poorspirited creature for all his prattle about truth and honor and No said Rhett If you must see him as he really is see him straight Hes only a gentleman caught in a world he doesnt belong in trying to make a poor best of it by the rules of the world thats gone Oh Rhett dont lets talk of him What does he matter now Arent you glad to know I mean now that I  Page    Gone With The Wind As his tired eyes met hers she broke off in embarrassment shy as a girl with her first beau If hed only make it easier for her If only he would hold out his arms so she could crawl thankfully into his lap and lay her head on his chest Her lips on his could tell him better than all her stumbling words But as she looked at him she realized that he was not holding her off just to be mean He looked drained and as though nothing she had said was of any moment Glad he said Once I would have thanked God fasting to hear you say all this But now it doesnt matter Doesnt matter What are you talking about Of course it matters Rhett you do care dont you You must care Melly said you did Well she was right as far as she knew But Scarlett did it ever occur to you that even the most deathless love could wear out She looked at him speechless her mouth a round O Mine wore out he went on against Ashley Wilkes and your insane obstinacy that makes you hold on like a bulldog to anything you think you want  Mine wore out But love cant wear out Yours for Ashley did But I never really loved Ashley Then you certainly gave a good imitation of itup till tonight Scarlett Im not upbraiding you accusing you reproaching you That time has passed So spare me your defenses and your explanations If you can manage to listen to me for a few minutes without interrupting I can explain what I mean Though God knows I see no need for explanations The truths so plain She sat down the harsh gas light falling on her white bewildered face She looked into the eyes she knew so welland knew so littlelistened to his quiet voice saying words which at first meant nothing This was the first time he had ever talked to her in this manner as one human being to another talked as other people talked without flippancy mockery or riddles Did it ever occur to you that I loved you as much as a man can love a woman Loved you for years before I finally got you During the war Id go away and try to forget you but I couldnt and I always had to come back After the war I risked arrest just to come back and find you I cared so much I believe I would have killed Frank Kennedy if he hadnt died when he did I loved you but I couldnt let you know it Youre so brutal to those who love you Scarlett You take their love and hold it over their heads like a whip Out of it all only the fact that he loved her meant anything At the faint echo of passion in his voice pleasure and excitement crept back into her She sat hardly breathing listening waiting I knew you didnt love me when I married you I knew about Ashley you see But fool that I was I thought I could make you care Laugh if you like but I wanted to take care of you to pet you to give you everything you wanted I wanted to marry you and protect you and give you a free rein in anything that would make you happyjust as I did Bonnie Youd had such a struggle Scarlett No one knew better than I what youd gone through and I wanted you to stop fighting and let me fight for you I wanted you to play like a childfor you were a child a brave frightened bullheaded child I think you are still a child No one but a child could be so headstrong and so insensitive His voice was calm and tired but there was something in the quality of it that raised a ghost of memory in Scarlett She had heard a voice like this once before and at some other crisis of her life Where had it been The voice of a man facing himself and his world without feeling without flinching without hope Whywhyit had been Ashley in the wintry windswept orchard at Tara talking of life and shadow shows with a tired calmness that had more finality in its timbre than any desperate bitterness could have revealed Even as Ashleys voice then had turned her cold with dread of things she could not understand so now Rhetts voice made her heart sink His voice his manner more than the content of his words disturbed her made her realize that her pleasurable excitement of a few moments ago had been untimely Something was wrong badly wrong What it was she did not know but she listened desperately her eyes on his brown face hoping to hear words that would dissipate her fears It was so obvious that we were meant for each other So obvious that I was the only man of your acquaintance who could love you after knowing you as you really arehard and greedy and unscrupulous like me I loved you and I took the chance I thought Ashley would fade out of your mind But he shrugged I tried everything I knew and nothing worked And I loved you so Scarlett If you had only let me I could have loved you as gently and as tenderly as ever a man loved a woman But I couldnt let you know for I knew youd think me weak and try to use my love against me And alwaysalways there was Ashley It drove me crazy I couldnt sit across the table from you every night knowing you wished Ashley was sitting there in my place And I couldnt hold you in my arms at night and know thatwell it doesnt matter now I wonder now why it hurt Thats what drove me to Belle There is a certain swinish comfort in being with a woman who loves you utterly and respects you for being a fine gentlemaneven if she is an illiterate whore It soothed my vanity Youve never been very soothing my dear Oh Rhett  she began miserable at the very mention of Belles name but he waved her to silence and went on And then that night when I carried you upstairsI thoughtI hopedI hoped so much I was afraid to face you the next morning for fear Id been mistaken and you didnt love me I was so afraid youd laugh at me I went off and got drunk And when I came back I was shaking in my boots and if you had come even halfway to meet me had given me some sign I think Id have kissed your feet But you didnt Oh but Rhett I did want you then but you were so nasty I did want you I thinkyes that must have been when I first knew I cared about you AshleyI never was happy about Ashley after that but you were so nasty that I Oh well he said It seems weve been at cross purposes doesnt it But it doesnt matter now Im only telling you so you wont ever wonder about it all When you were sick and it was all my fault I stood outside your door hoping youd call for me but you didnt and then I knew what a fool Id been and that it was all over He stopped and looked through her and beyond her even as Ashley had often done seeing something she could not see And she could only stare speechless at his brooding face But then there was Bonnie and I saw that everything wasnt over after all I liked to think that Bonnie was you a little girl  Page    Gone With The Wind again before the war and poverty had done things to you She was so like you so willful so brave and gay and full of high spirits and I could pet her and spoil herjust as I wanted to pet you But she wasnt like youshe loved me It was a blessing that I could take the love you didnt want and give it to her  When she went she took everything Suddenly she was sorry for him sorry with a completeness that wiped out her own grief and her fear of what his words might mean It was the first time in her life she had been sorry for anyone without feeling contemptuous as well because it was the first time she had ever approached understanding any other human being And she could understand his shrewd caginess so like her own his obstinate pride that kept him from admitting his love for fear of a rebuff Ah darling she said coming forward hoping he would put out his arms and draw her to his knees Darling Im so sorry but Ill make it all up to you We can be so happy now that we know the truth andRhettlook at me Rhett Therethere can be other babiesnot like Bonnie but Thank you no said Rhett as if he were refusing a piece of bread Ill not risk my heart a third time Rhett dont say such things Oh what can I say to make you understand Ive told you how sorry I am My darling youre such a child You think that by saying Im sorry all the errors and hurts of years past can be remedied obliterated from the mind all the poison drawn from old wounds  Take my handkerchief Scarlett Never at any crisis of your life have I known you to have a handkerchief She took the handkerchief blew her nose and sat down It was obvious that he was not going to take her in his arms It was beginning to be obvious that all his talk about loving her meant nothing It was a tale of a time long past and he was looking at it as though it had never happened to him And that was frightening He looked at her in an almost kindly way speculation in his eyes How old are you my dear You never would tell me Twentyeight she answered dully muffled in the handkerchief Thats not a vast age Its a young age to have gained the whole world and lost your own soul isnt it Dont look frightened Im not referring to hell fire to come for your affair with Ashley Im merely speaking metaphorically Ever since Ive known you youve wanted two things Ashley and to be rich enough to tell the world to go to hell Well you are rich enough and youve spoken sharply to the world and youve got Ashley if you want him But all that doesnt seem to be enough now She was frightened but not at the thought of hell fire She was thinking But Rhett is my soul and Im losing him And if I lose him nothing else matters No not friends or money oror anything If only I had him I wouldnt even mind being poor again No I wouldnt mind being cold again or even hungry But he cant mean Oh he cant She wiped her eyes and said desperately Rhett if you once loved me so much there must be something left for me Out of it all I find only two things that remain and they are the two things you hate the mostpity and an odd feeling of kindness Pity Kindness Oh my God she thought despairingly Anything hut pity and kindness Whenever she felt these two emotions for anyone they went hand in hand with contempt Was he contemptuous of her too Anything would be preferable to that Even the cynical coolness of the war days the drunken madness that drove him the night he carried her up the stairs his hard fingers bruising her body or the barbed drawling words that she now realized had covered a bitter love Anything except this impersonal kindness that was written so plainly in his face Thenthen you mean Ive ruined it allthat you dont love me any more Thats right But she said stubbornly like a child who still feels that to state a desire is to gain that desire but I love you Thats your misfortune She looked up quickly to see if there was a jeer behind those words but there was none He was simply stating a fact But it was a fact she still would not believecould not believe She looked at him with slanting eyes that burned with a desperate obstinacy and the sudden hard line of jaw that sprang out through her soft cheek was Geralds jaw Dont be a fool Rhett I can make He flung up a hand in mock horror and his black brows went up in the old sardonic crescents Dont look so determined Scarlett You frighten me I see you are contemplating the transfer of your tempestuous affections from Ashley to me and I fear for my liberty and my peace of mind No Scarlett I will not be pursued as the luckless Ashley was pursued Besides I am going away Her jaw trembled before she clenched her teeth to steady it Go away No anything but that How could life go on without him Everyone had gone from her everyone who mattered except Rhett He couldnt go But how could she stop him She was powerless against his cool mind his disinterested words I am going away I intended to tell you when you came home from Marietta You are deserting me Dont be the neglected dramatic wife Scarlett The role isnt becoming I take it then you do not want a divorce or even a separation Well then Ill come back often enough to keep gossip down Damn gossip she said fiercely Its you I want Take me with you No he said and there was finality in his voice For a moment she was on the verge of an outburst of childish wild tears She could have thrown herself on the floor cursed and screamed and drummed her heels But some remnant of pride of common sense stiffened her She thought if I did hed only laugh or just look at me I mustnt bawl I mustnt beg I mustnt do anything to risk his contempt He must respect me eveneven if he doesnt love me She lifted her chin and managed to ask quietly Where will you go There was a faint gleam of admiration in his eyes as he answered Perhaps to Englandor to Paris Perhaps to Charleston to try to make peace with my people  Page    Gone With The Wind But you hate them Ive heard you laugh at them so often and He shrugged I still laughbut Ive reached the end of roaming Scarlett Im fortyfivethe age when a man begins to value some of the things hes thrown away so lightly in youth the clannishness of families honor and security roots that go deep Oh not Im not recanting Im not regretting anything Ive ever done Ive had a hell of a good timesuch a hell of a good time that its begun to pall and now I want something different No I never intend to change more than my spots But I want the outer semblance of the things I used to know the utter boredom of respectabilityother peoples respectability my pet not my ownthe calm dignity life can have when its lived by gentle folks the genial grace of days that are gone When I lived those days I didnt realize the slow charm of them Again Scarlett was back in the windy orchard of Tara and there was the same look in Rhetts eyes that had been in Ashleys eyes that day Ashleys words were as clear in her ears as though he and not Rhett were speaking Fragments of words came back to her and she quoted parrotlike A glamour to ita perfection a symmetry like Grecian art Rhett said sharply Why did you say that Thats what I meant It was something thatthat Ashley said once about the old days He shrugged and the light went out of his eyes Always Ashley he said and was silent for a moment Scarlett when you are fortyfive perhaps you will know what Im talking about and then perhaps you too will be tired of imitation gentry and shoddy manners and cheap emotions But I doubt it I think youll always be more attracted by glister than by gold Anyway I cant wait that long to see And I have no desire to wait It just doesnt interest me Im going to hunt in old towns and old countries where some of the old times must still linger Im that sentimental Atlantas too raw for me too new Stop she said suddenly She had hardly heard anything he had said Certainly her mind had not taken it in But she knew she could no longer endure with any fortitude the sound of his voice when there was no love in it He paused and looked at her quizzically Well you get my meaning dont you he questioned rising to his feet She threw out her hands to him palms up in the ageold gesture of appeal and her heart again was in her face No she cried All I know is that you do not love me and you are going away Oh my darling if you go what shall I do For a moment he hesitated as if debating whether a kind lie were kinder in the long run than the truth Then he shrugged Scarlett I was never one to patiently pick up broken fragments and glue them together and tell myself that the mended whole was as good as new What is broken is brokenand Id rather remember it as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as long as I lived Perhaps if I were younger he sighed But Im too old to believe in such sentimentalities as clean slates and starting all over Im too old to shoulder the burden of constant lies that go with living in polite disillusionment I couldnt live with you and lie to you and I certainly couldnt lie to myself I cant even lie to you now I wish I could care what you do or where you go but I cant He drew a short breath and said lightly but softly My dear I dont give a damn  She silently watched him go up the stairs feeling that she would strangle at the pain in her throat With the sound of his feet dying away in the upper hall was dying the last thing in the world that mattered She knew now that there was no appeal of emotion or reason which would turn that cool brain from its verdict She knew now that he had meant every word he said lightly though some of them had been spoken She knew because she sensed in him something strong unyielding implacableall the qualities she had looked for in Ashley and never found She had never understood either of the men she had loved and so she had lost them both Now she had a fumbling knowledge that had she ever understood Ashley she would never have loved him had she ever understood Rhett she would never have lost him She wondered forlornly if she had ever really understood anyone in the world There was a merciful dullness in her mind now a dullness that she knew from long experience would soon give way to sharp pain even as severed tissues shocked by the surgeons knife have a brief instant of insensibility before their agony begins I wont think of it now she thought grimly summoning up her old charm Ill go crazy if I think about losing him now Ill think of it tomorrow But cried her heart casting aside the charm and beginning to ache I cant let him go There must be some way I wont think of it now she said again aloud trying to push her misery to the back of her mind trying to find some bulwark against the rising tide of pain Illwhy Ill go home to Tara tomorrow and her spirits lifted faintly She had gone back to Tara once in fear and defeat and she had emerged from its sheltering walls strong and armed for victory What she had done once somehowplease God she could do again How she did not know She did not want to think of that now All she wanted was a breathing space in which to hurt a quiet place to lick her wounds a haven in which to plan her campaign She thought of Tara and it was as if a gentle cool hand were stealing over her heart She could see the white house gleaming welcome to her through the reddening autumn leaves feel the quiet hush of the country twilight coming down over her like a benediction feel the dews falling on the acres of green bushes starred with fleecy white see the raw color of the red earth and the dismal dark beauty of the pines on the rolling hills She felt vaguely comforted strengthened by the picture and some of her hurt and frantic regret was pushed from the top of her mind She stood for a moment remembering small things the avenue of dark cedars leading to Tara the banks of cape jessamine bushes vivid green against the white walls the fluttering white curtains And Mammy would be there Suddenly she wanted Mammy desperately as she had wanted her when she was a little girl wanted the broad bosom on which to lay her head the gnarled black hand on her hair Mammy the last link with the old days With the spirit of her people who would not know defeat even when it stared them in the face she raised her chin She could  Page    Gone With The Wind get Rhett back She knew she could There had never been a man she couldnt get once she set her mind upon him Ill think of it all tomorrow at Tara I can stand it then Tomorrow Ill think of some way to get him back After all tomorrow is another day THE END  Page
